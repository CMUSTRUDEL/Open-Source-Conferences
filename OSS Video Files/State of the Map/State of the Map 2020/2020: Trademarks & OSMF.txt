A summary of trademark law basics and an explanation of the OSMF Trademark Policy and how it applies.

The purpose of this talk is to give those interested a foundational explanation of what trademark law is and how the OSMF Trademark Policy works. 

There have been several questions raised to LWG regarding the OSMF Trademark Policy and how it applies in certain circumstances. Trademark law is often conflated with other types of intellectual property law and the scope of trademark rights is not well-understood.  In addition, the LWG sometimes fields questions from OSM users or groups on how to use the Trademark Policy and forms and templates mentioned in the policy. This talk will go over some common questions and give the audience a chance to ask more.   

Outline for the talk:

Trademarks 101:

What is a trademark? (vs other forms of intellectual property, like copyright, data rights, patent, trade secrets, publicity rights)

How do you get trademark rights?
 - Trademarks are jurisdictional
 - Acquiring rights via usage
 - Trademark registration

Trademark use vs not trademark use
 - Using a term "as a mark"
 - Sponsorship/endorsement
 - What trademark doesn't protect
 - fair uses

OSM trademarks:
 - The OSMF Trademark Policy
 - Common uses
 - Pre-policy use cases
 - Domains
 - Using the permission template

Questions!

hi my name is cathlin lu and today i

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,450
will be talking about trademark law and

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,320
the OpenStreetMap foundation trademark

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,539
policy so we'll start with a

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,289
foundational overview of trademark law

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:29,609
and then we'll discuss the policy and

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:33,660
how it affects the community so first

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,700
off what is a trademark trademark is a

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,630
word or symbol or something else that

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:44,060
serves as a source identifier for goods

00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:49,020
or services so what does that mean a

00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:53,940
trademark identifies the provider of

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:57,960
goods or services and not just describes

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,040
a quality of the product let's break

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,820
that down

00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:06,380
in order for something to serve as a

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:13,109
source identifier it needs to give the

00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:16,109
person who sees the mark an idea of the

00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:18,840
provider of the goods and services not

00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:24,509
just a quality of the goods and services

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:29,340
and there are lots of words out there

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:35,600
that will describe whether a good or

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:40,649
service is quality is fast is cheap

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:44,939
right but for something to function as a

00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:47,899
trademark it needs to answer who that

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:52,709
good or service is coming from not just

00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:57,380
describe that good or service so as an

00:01:52,709 --> 00:02:01,409
example if you saw a storefront that

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:07,140
said delicious pastries

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:09,929
do you know it does that say to you this

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,769
is a store where I could get some really

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:19,410
great tasting baked goods or does I say

00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:23,580
to you oh this is part of the delicious

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:28,700
chain of bakeries that's the difference

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:33,560
between a word that is a descriptor and

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:37,680
a word that can function as a trademark

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:42,090
another example is if there is a really

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:46,470
pretty flower on the store sign is that

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:49,769
just decorative or is that a logo the

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:53,370
difference is whether it signals to the

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:56,579
viewing consumer that this is a

00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:01,109
particular source for goods and services

00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:03,750
or it's just pretty so one important

00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:06,090
thing to know about trademarks is that

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,170
they are jurisdictional so your rights

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,290
in one country I may be very strong I

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,709
and your rights in another country may

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:20,099
be non-existent

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:23,130
trademarks last for typically as long as

00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:26,099
you continue to use them and maintain

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:31,260
the registration but again the rules

00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:34,440
differ from country to country so how do

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,950
you actually get a trademark there are

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:41,430
two main factors one is actual use and

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:45,090
the other is registration so there are

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,829
several countries including very

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,590
prominently the United States that

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:54,959
require you to actually use a trademark

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:56,760
in commerce in order to have rights even

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,730
if you were to acquire registration

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,540
without actual use it would be subject

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:06,599
to cancellation for fraud you can also

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,620
in the US get common law rights where

00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:14,640
you use a trademark but you don't go get

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:18,780
a registration and that use can

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:23,190
have priority over someone later who

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:25,230
comes and register the same name in

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,690
other countries including most of Europe

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:31,410
you have to get a registration in order

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:35,400
to have any protection at all but then

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:38,580
in other countries I registration is

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:44,330
while not necessary will give you

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:48,510
additional rights in protection such as

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:52,290
presumptions or priorities so what is

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:56,040
the point of trademark the fundamental

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:59,490
goal of trademark law is to protect

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,520
against consumer confusion so this is

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:07,370
really all about what does the consuming

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:11,310
public think when they see a trademark

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:16,050
dude wait when somebody sees something

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:21,120
and thinks oh okay that means that this

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:24,440
is from a particular place we want that

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:31,880
to be an accurate perception

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:34,770
so what trademark law does is steer

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,600
products and services from using away

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:47,810
from using names that are too similar to

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:53,100
each other so an example of this is if

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:57,060
you have if you have a name that's

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,720
completely made-up then in all

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:04,229
likelihood if somebody sees that name

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:08,940
they're gonna associate it with you and

00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:12,990
if somebody else came along and used

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,789
that same name then they probably could

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,010
not get a trademark registration for it

00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:20,970
and you may be able to take them to

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:28,400
court to stop their use but at the same

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:28,400
time I we recognize in trademark law

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,720
providers of goods and services still

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:40,650
need to be able to use words to describe

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,500
the products and services so for

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:46,600
descriptive words there is a lot less

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,790
protection and there is understanding

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:55,660
that consumers can distinguish between

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:57,940
marks that are quite similar because of

00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:01,150
the descriptive nature of the

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,490
similarities so a good example of this

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:06,400
is there is an airline called air China

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,920
there is another one called China

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,490
Airlines and there is a China Southern

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:15,760
Airlines and a China Eastern Airlines

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:18,760
and these companies coexist they fly

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,130
into some of the same airports and

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,400
consumers understand the difference and

00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:28,630
they look to other cues to tell the

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,270
different companies apart because they

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:35,410
expect that it's normal to have the name

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:41,020
of a country in airline name and to have

00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:42,940
air or airline in the name similarly you

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,420
can have companies that have the same

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,830
name but that do very different things

00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,840
and the expectation is that consumers

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:53,320
will not be confused so there's a Delta

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,090
Airlines there's delta faucets there is

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,490
a delta that sells heating cooling

00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,520
equipment and a delta that's a bank and

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:05,460
there's probably many dozens or hundreds

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:11,670
more Delta's out there with respect to

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:17,110
OpenStreetMap the terms open and map

00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:20,890
individually are generic for a map that

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:23,760
is out there under an open license

00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:28,960
available to the public but

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:32,820
OpenStreetMap is a descriptive name that

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:41,099
over time has acquired distinctiveness

00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:44,620
so even though OpenStreetMap describes

00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:49,149
the project which is an open mapping

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:52,690
database it is not the only name that

00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:55,720
could be used for that type of project

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:59,220
or the name that you would expect to be

00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,500
used for a project of that nature and

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:07,149
over time people have heard the

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:11,470
OpenStreetMap name and now OpenStreetMap

00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:18,550
really means one thing which is the

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:21,959
OpenStreetMap project so a one thing to

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:27,279
keep in mind is what a trademark is not

00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:31,180
so you will see people use some of these

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,850
terms when they are talking about what

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,339
is actually a trademark issue or you

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:40,600
might see a trademark described as a

00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:44,890
patent or copyright or something else so

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:49,180
the key differences patent is exclusive

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:53,350
rights over an invention a copyright is

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:56,079
rights over that when you author an

00:09:53,350 --> 00:10:00,820
expressive work you can't get a

00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:04,540
copyright over a name design rights are

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:07,529
about how a product looks so with the

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:11,140
products sort of attractiveness

00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:16,350
publicity rights are about your own name

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:19,480
it's really about excluding others from

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:23,440
advertising your endorsement or

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,600
Association names can be trademarks but

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,250
it's not at a mat automatic it's only if

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,329
you start using your name as a source

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:37,200
identifier for your goods or services

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:39,190
that you would have trademark rights if

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,149
you're just trying to keep someone else

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,850
from doing it

00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:46,959
that's publicity rights and of course

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:50,050
relevant to osm is database rights which

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,980
are rights over a collection of data

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,980
that you've compiled

00:10:53,210 --> 00:11:03,730
so OS MF has put out trademark policy to

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:08,510
govern the communities use of trademarks

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:12,530
and this policy was designed to try to

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:17,920
cover the general uses that the

00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:23,600
community sees regularly so here are

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:27,860
some links to the policy to the FAQ as

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:34,730
well as to license templates for

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:38,450
commonly seen scenarios so just an

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:43,100
overview these this is a list of the OSM

00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:47,530
marks most notably you'll see that OS m

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:50,960
itself is only a trademark of

00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:55,700
OpenStreetMap foundation in the geo

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:58,220
context and that's because there are

00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:02,090
circumstances outside of the geo context

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,460
where the acronym OS m means something

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:08,750
else and can mean something else just

00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:14,270
like with the Delta example so I've put

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:21,350
up here a couple of examples of uses

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:26,630
that the policy covers and that are

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:32,420
common examples of things that we see so

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:36,260
first off parody and satire some

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:39,890
countries extend these rights by law the

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:43,130
policy says this is okay whether or not

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:49,400
your particular jurisdiction extends it

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:55,220
by law it's also okay to honestly

00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:58,880
describe something as being made with

00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:03,520
OpenStreetMap data using OpenStreetMap

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,070
you can also compare another product to

00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:11,550
OpenStreetMap and now

00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:15,600
rising and in terms of personal use you

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:18,030
can make t-shirts I you for you know

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,480
stickers for yourself and your friends

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:26,420
your local chapter but we do ask that

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:30,930
you if you want to sell those please

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:35,030
write to us and ask for permission the

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:41,550
key thing that we want to avoid is any

00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:45,200
confusion between what is an official

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:49,140
OpenStreetMap Foundation project and

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:53,400
projects that use OpenStreetMap so

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:56,160
please I don't register any domains that

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:59,370
are just OpenStreetMap you know with

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,100
whatever domain ending

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:07,140
please don't make an app called

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:10,230
OpenStreetMap people are likely to think

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:13,380
that that's an official app please don't

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:17,460
include OpenStreetMap in the name of a

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:20,580
company or try to register OpenStreetMap

00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:25,710
as a trademark anywhere

00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:31,500
we also under the policy ask that you

00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:37,140
not combine OpenStreetMap with other

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:40,100
words to mash together the name of

00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:45,000
project this is something that we know

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:50,870
happened in a fair amount before the

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:54,900
policy was enacted and we do have a

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:59,190
process for people to let us know about

00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:02,460
pre-existing products and granting them

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:07,080
licenses to grandfather the use in under

00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:11,040
the policy but going forward names like

00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:14,340
that can tend to create some confusion

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,190
about how a project is associated with

00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,160
OpenStreetMap and with

00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:24,770
Oh SMF so we ask that people not doing

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:30,980
that going forward we one thing that I

00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:35,420
want to call out is if you are if you

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:38,350
have a product that you and you want to

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:41,000
have osm in the name of that product

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,070
please write to us and ask for

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,440
permission we want to look at the

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:52,340
context and look at how you're using osm

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:55,250
to see whether that's okay if it's just

00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:58,760
the name of say an open-source project

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,650
or a tool or something like that you

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:05,900
don't need to ask us for permission

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:10,450
that's covered by the policy where that

00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:15,890
permission is granted to everyone for

00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:18,890
events if you are hosting a mapathon or

00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:23,830
a mapping party that's fine to advertise

00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:28,510
that is an OSM mapathon but if you are

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:32,210
organizing a state of the map please

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:39,430
write in using the template and get

00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:48,170
permission and because we want to avoid

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:53,120
conflicts so one key area that I want to

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:55,730
highlight is domains so OS MF would

00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:01,430
prefer to own domains that include the

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:03,140
OSF marks we have purchased domains for

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,949
local chapters and then pointed it at

00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:13,030
those local chapters the reason we do

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:16,670
this is because of in possible

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:20,360
instability you know if a maintainer or

00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:26,839
two is for whatever reason unable to

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:29,840
continue a project then that domain may

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:33,200
expire it may end up

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,850
ice with somebody squatting on it or a

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,450
company using it for something that's a

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,559
different unrelated project

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:47,179
OpenStreetMap Foundation has their

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:52,610
resources to maintain those domains and

00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:56,690
to keep that up so if you already have a

00:17:52,610 --> 00:18:00,799
domain that you registered before the

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:03,440
policy was in place you can transfer to

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,169
OS MF we will pay the fees for that

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:13,039
transfer and then we can point it back

00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:17,230
at you so there are a couple of

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:23,659
permission templates up on the website

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:27,409
if you think you need a license download

00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:29,600
and fill out that template if you're not

00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:32,899
sure you can write into trademark set

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:37,940
open stream oh s M foundation or to ask

00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:41,870
I if your if the you know you look at

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:44,419
the policy and you're not sure if you

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,570
have one of these uses that might be

00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:49,820
grandfathered in please explain the

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:55,640
history of your project when it started

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:59,720
what its relation to osm is send that in

00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,510
and the lwg

00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,309
will discuss matter before making a

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,679
recommendation to the board

00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:10,130
we might need some clarifications from

00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:14,090
you but if approved the board will sign

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:16,690
and return that license to you similarly

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:19,399
if you are organizing a state of the map

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,270
please get in touch with the licensed

00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:25,539
working group check for any conflicts

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:28,250
for dates you know state of the maps are

00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:31,580
pretty big events and we don't want to

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:33,350
have them too close together so you know

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,899
let us know and coordinate with us

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:39,940
before you start advertising a location

00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:43,700
and dates but there's a template online

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:46,670
fill that out and send that in

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,580
we'll be internally checking with the

00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:52,070
state of map working group and if

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:55,580
everything looks good a member of the

00:19:52,070 --> 00:20:00,679
board will sign the license and set it

00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:03,140
back to you if you have any questions

00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:07,429
you can always write into trademarks at

00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:11,230
osm foundation org and we also have time

00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:11,230
for some questions right now

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,390
you

00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:11,060
now it is so is mmm the showing at the

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:17,390
OS OS and my trademark policy has ended

00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:21,560

00:21:50,230 --> 00:22:05,890
well well how is short and hi everyone

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:39,509
hi so I I can answer questions from the

00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:41,429
hackpad so FYI

00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:46,139
I have copied and pasted the links from

00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:52,229
the presentation into the hackpad and if

00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:54,539
you have questions later you can email

00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:58,679
trademarks at osm foundation about org

00:22:54,539 --> 00:23:02,779
to reach the lwg you can also find me on

00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,779
twitter at kathleen the law

00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,990
you

00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:25,410
is there a question you'd like me answer

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:41,290
first stone okay so let me have another

00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:48,940
question there's no hello did you hear

00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:52,840
me yes okay my network is not so stable

00:23:48,940 --> 00:24:07,420
I can sing the Eccleston I hear the

00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:12,790
echoes of my voice Richard F is asking

00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:15,610
you mentioned that wwws eMERCOM would

00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:18,070
not would need permission to take a

00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:21,760
well-known example does that apply to

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:27,490
osm and and if so what's the current

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:32,230
situation there so OS m and is an

00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:33,400
example of projection that applicator or

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:37,630
application that would have been

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:42,030
grandfathered in because it existed and

00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:45,490
it was using the OSM Nate OSF and named

00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:51,550
long before the trademark policy was put

00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:54,970
into place so the lwg is an

00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:58,600
all-volunteer working group like all the

00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:03,160
other working groups of osm F so there

00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:06,670
is a lot there are a lot of grandfather

00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:12,360
projects frankly because the community

00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:16,630
has been around for so many years and so

00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:21,970
basically we encourage all projects of

00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:25,390
that nature to write in to us and just

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:27,920
formally you know put into place their

00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:31,480
relationship with osm F

00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:37,040
but it is a bit of the situation where

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:40,520
if we don't get completes about people

00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,250
being confused then a project is not

00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,250
going to be at the top of our list where

00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:49,880
we need to reach out to them and say oh

00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:52,480
you need to put a disclaimer up or or

00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,480
something like that

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:11,630
I see the questions have changed

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:16,220
languages I believe that there was a

00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:23,410
question earlier about logos so yes just

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:28,790
to be clear what about visual marks

00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:31,460
about the logos and in a clarification

00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:33,680
it reads yes the real logo especially

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,500
visually appealing attribution without

00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:39,200
trying to confuse so using the logo I

00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:42,980
guess to attribute that the OS and data

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:46,400
is used yeah it's so it's the policy

00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:55,360
says that it is totally fine to use the

00:26:46,400 --> 00:27:01,160
logo to accurately links to OSM or to

00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:06,740
indicate that you're sending somebody to

00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:10,490
OSM it goes along with the sort of the

00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:15,860
concept of nominated to fair use sort of

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:22,540
this accurate identification with logos

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:26,390
it can be I often times with logos is

00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:30,380
it's trickier to not confuse but it's

00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:34,010
certainly doable so sometimes people

00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:38,950
will you know put a disclaimer or

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:43,720
something to make to make clear that

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,720
they don't have an official affiliation

00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:56,960
and that goes for the the state of the

00:27:49,039 --> 00:28:02,270
map logos as well okay I have one

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:07,090
question about this remark so if I for

00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:11,870
example if I'm working in the scroll

00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:16,970
organization is nonprofit so the

00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:24,730
trademark should be unique and must be

00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:30,470
one local without any like um credit

00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:34,870
issues and because some I learned and

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:39,770
now some of the form the phones have the

00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:51,710
trade lost the company but it not should

00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:56,149
be used by faith so the fonts should be

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:57,260
shouldn't be used in that logos in some

00:28:56,149 --> 00:29:00,080
company

00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:03,529
for business but for nonprofits

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:07,630
sometimes it can be used and on the

00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:11,330
trailer does they have the same problem

00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:13,520
so if I understand what you're talking

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:17,620
about you're referencing the situation

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:21,370
where there are certain fonts that are

00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:26,090
licensed under non-commercial licenses

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:30,919
meaning that they are available for use

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:37,899
by nonprofit organizations or academic

00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:42,590
use but not by commercial companies and

00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:44,419
my my assumption in that situation would

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,770
be that that would be a copyright

00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:52,929
license and there are many copyright

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:54,840
licenses out there that specify

00:29:52,929 --> 00:30:00,360
non-commercial use as a

00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:04,350
condition so examples are CC by NCCC by

00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:07,320
non-commercial uh what one thing I

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:11,390
covered in my talk was the difference

00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:16,470
between trademarks and copyright so

00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:19,140
trademarks are cecilia bout brands and

00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:26,940
the symbols that represent brands in

00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:30,480
commerce it something is not in commerce

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:33,300
it's you know if it's if it's a personal

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:38,310
use for example it's not trademark of

00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:44,400
course there is even for schools right

00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:46,500
they they have a relationship to the

00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,160
stream of Commerce you know you you pay

00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,350
tuition you know schools might have the

00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,420
the name of the school on a t-shirt and

00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,840
they might sell that t-shirt things like

00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:00,990
that

00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:06,270
so I the trademarks still are a thing

00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:10,650
for schools to pay attention to but with

00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:15,680
respect to OpenStreetMap specifically as

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:21,690
the trademark policy states we welcome

00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:25,530
clubs and local communities including

00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:28,260
school clubs who you know organize their

00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:33,890
own mapathon Zoar organize things like

00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:36,870
that and those groups are free to

00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:41,130
advertise their meetings as a you know

00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:44,190
osm mapping party or you know things

00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:51,570
like that and to use the OSM name and to

00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:57,030
use the OSM logo to - you know circulate

00:31:51,570 --> 00:32:00,870
information about those groups I as I

00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:04,080
said the only the only real exception to

00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:08,260
that is state of the map conferences

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,780
where we want people to get permission

00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:14,560
because state of the map is sort of a

00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,780
bigger event and we want people to

00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:20,160
coordinate with the state of the map

00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:23,440
working for state of the map committee

00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:34,500
before they advertise the state of the

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:34,500
map thank you thank you very much

00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:45,310
okay so if anybody has any future

00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:47,890
questions as I said you can email the

00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:50,200
working group at trademarks uh-oh

00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:52,260

00:32:52,260 --> 00:33:06,930
