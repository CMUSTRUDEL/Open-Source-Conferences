This study explores the following research questions using OpenStreetMap-based mapping approach and healthcare facility survey from one of seven slums being studied in Africa and Asia. What are the differentials of spatial proximity to health care providers in informal settlements like slum? What are some of the lessons learnt from using OpenStreetMap-based mapping approach for slum health research? Preliminary findings suggest that residents can access four categories of healthcare facilities (Clinics/Maternity Centres; Patent Medicine Stores; Traditional/Faith Healers; Eye Health Centre) within a walking distance (under 1km) where Clinics and Maternity Centres are farthest from most residents.

Background. The United Nation Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 seeks to ensure universal health coverage for everyone irrespective of geographical location by 2030. Anecdotal evidence exists on the possibility of attainment of the goal at household level in slum areas most especially in Africa. Recent studies suggest further work on the advancement of empirical evidence on slum health [1], [2]; especially in Africa where slum population growth is reported to be at the same level with urban population growth [3]. There is the need to understand the dimensions of spatial proximity to healthcare facilities in Nigeria towards achieving SDG 3 [4]; especially in slum areas where little evidence exists. Spatial access to appropriate healthcare is even more relevant given the rapid rise in Covid-19 cases globally. The lack of detailed quality spatial data is a concern to both researchers and development agencies [5]. In an attempt to contribute to the knowledge gap in slum health studies, this study draws on two data sets (field validated OpenStreetMap data and healthcare facility survey data) from an ongoing research project to examine spatial proximity to healthcare facilities (HCFs) in Sasa, an informal urban “slum” area in Nigeria. The decision to focus on spatial proximity is based on findings from a household survey, in an ongoing project, which suggest that one of the main reasons given by respondents for choosing HCFs is proximity. Conceptually, there are two main schools of thought about spatial proximity [6]; this study considers proximity as a distance measure defined quantitatively. The ongoing research project is a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Global Health Unit on Improving Health in Slums at University of Warwick [7]. This Unit focuses on health services in slums through the study of seven slum sites in Africa and Asia and aims at finding optimal ways to enhance health services. We thus present initial results from one of the study sites in Africa. The following research questions are explored. What are the differentials of spatial proximity to health care providers in informal settlements like slum? What are some of the lessons learnt from using OpenStreetMap-based mapping approach for slum health research?

Method. An OpenStreetMap-based data collection methodological approach was developed and implemented [8]. A spatially-referenced sampling frame was generated through a combination of: remote participatory mapping from satellite imagery; local participatory mapping and ground-truthing; and the identification of dwellings of each validated structure. Additionally, a healthcare facility survey was conducted to capture types of facilities etc. The following categories of HCFs are drawn from survey data and used for analyses: four Clinics and Maternity Centres (CMC); twenty-two Patent Medicine Stores (PMS); five Traditional and Faith Healers (TFH); and, one Eye Health Centre (EHC). Two-fold analyses are conducted. First, two measures of spatial proximity (spatial network and Euclidean distances) to different types of HCFs within the site are computed using field validated OpenStreetMap (OSM) network data. Bivariate analysis is performed to test sinuosity (ratio of network and Euclidean distance). Additionally, comparative analyses of combined means and medians (using k-independent samples median tests) for categories of HCFs are performed. Second, a reflective exercise is undertaken to outline some of the lessons learnt during the research process related to the OSM-based approach.

Result. The presentation will discuss the outcome of the two-fold inquiry outlined. Preliminary results show strong positive correlation (r=.97; 99% CI) between the two spatial proximity measures suggesting that Euclidean and network spaces are quite similar in terms of accessibility to health care services within Sasa slum. Overall sinuosity index is 1.16 suggesting that the non-linear nature of network routes to HCFs contributes to 16% more than the Euclidean metric.

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,520
as a guide for this study

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,200
what are the differentials of special

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,840
proximity healthcare providers in

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,319
informal

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,440
settlements like islam what are some of

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,040
the lessons learned from using

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,040
openstreetmap-based marketing approach

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,959
for slum health research

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,400
these research questions are explored

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,400
using an ongoing research project

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,720

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,400
health in slums at university of warwick

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,000
the goals are to mob health services and

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,560
facilities and understand how these are

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,640
used in slums across asia and africa

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,400
to build on these maps to identify costs

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,680
associated with how health services run

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,200
in each site

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,120
to build models of health services and

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,360
use these models to look at ways of

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,959
improving health service delivery

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,720
throughout these goals we are collating

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,040
existing evidence and also involving

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,959
people who can change things in slums

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,720
including politicians civil servants

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,400
people who live in slums

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,400
and open street map or some community

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,519
who can help generate quality baseline

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
maps

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,120
the duration of this project is

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,319
approximately four years ending in march

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,319
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,560
and costing over five million pounds

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,480
there are five work packages designed to

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,640
address the goals of the unit

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,760

working with the university of ibadan in

00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,519
nigeria where three islams are being

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,799
studied

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,040
these are shasha eddikan and variga

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
and we have also the african population

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,159
and health research center in kenya

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,200
where two slums are being studied

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,720
kodogota and viran danislams in asia we

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,480
are working with the agakon university

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,920
in pakistan whereas ambassador islam is

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
being studied

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,199
and we have also the independent

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,639
university bangladesh where qra islam is

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,160
being studied

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
in this presentation the results are

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,720
taken from the green highlighted islam

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
that shasha

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,360
cheshire has relatively less dense

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,280
buildings with density of about 2700

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,720
buildings per square kilometer

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
the buildings are not that tall and

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,759
mostly have a roofing sheet

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,360
chasha is the biggest slum when compared

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,120
with the other slum sites

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,120
and is about one square kilometer

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,440
i will now talk about methods in this

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
study

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,919
in terms of methods used in this study

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,960
an openstream based data collection

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,720
approach was used

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,000
to map and survey healthcare facilities

00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,360
among others

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,600
the healthcare facilities were then

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,440
grouped into four main categories

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
special proximity and seniority measures

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,960
were then computed to assess geographic

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,240
access to different types of healthcare

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,240
facilities

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,160
discretely statistics were used to

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,960
describe the computed spatial proximity

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,479
measures

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,320
whereas personal correlation between

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,600
network and euclidean distances

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,960
was also computed reflective exercise on

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,840
lessons learnt during the data

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,520
collection was also

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,160
undertaken one thing we are doing

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,919
differently

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
is that we are systematically adapting

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,199
openstreetmap to develop a specially

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
regulated sampling method

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,120
in health research in a multi-country

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,039
informal urban setting

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,120
the study protocol is published and

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,720
cited here

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,400
we frame the production of informal

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,759
urban community data as an

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,199
interdisciplinary methodological

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,960
challenge and situated at the

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,919
intersection of spatial data quality on

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,520
one hand

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,479
and community engagement on the other

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,160
hand traditional mapping techniques

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,520
such as those used by geomatics

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,840
components and

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,600
national mapping agencies can produce

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,039
spatial data with a higher degree of

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,319
adherence to spatial data quality

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,319
standards

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,840
they follow strict guidelines and aim at

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,520
well-defined set of dimensions of

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,080
spatial data quality

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,440
example completeness of map features

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,039
logical consistencies

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,800
positional temporal and thematic

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,639
accuracies

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
however the application of these methods

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,919
is costly

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,720
and the technical expertise required

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,160
excludes inhabitants from the

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,000
poor urban communities from the process

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,080
in contrast participation mapping

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,479
techniques such as the ones used in the

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,880
humanitarian mapping community

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,400
are a good way to engage residents and

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,160
local stakeholders in thinking

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,560
differently about their relationship

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
with environment and urban space

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
but the extent to which the resultant

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,680
data matches quality requirements is

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
often uncertain

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,960
operating at the intersection of these

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,880
two marking traditions we see an

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,240
interdisciplinary problem space that is

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,240
associated with

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,599
a two-fold methodological challenge

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,800
entrenched in one

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,039
the promotion of effective engagement

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,840
and participation of local stakeholders

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,680
and residents of urban communities with

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,919
the goals of building capacity

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,880
empowering them for creating a local

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,280
ownership

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,440
and ensuring the sustainability of

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,440
geographic data generated

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,039
and two assessment and improvement

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,960
spatial data quality

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,440
in order to ensure that the resultant

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,479
data is able to capture intraurban

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,960
inequalities

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,599
and be used as trusted evidence for

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,440
scientific research and policy making

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,120
to tackle this challenge our approach is

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,800
based on a participatory and

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,599
collaborative mapping

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,160
but in addition to the methods adopted

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,520
by

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,440
similar existing initiatives

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,720
the diagram here illustrates an overview

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,879
of our opinions treatment based

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,800
participatory debt collection approach

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,319
the first step involves preparation

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,919
activities where training materials are

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,759
prepared and responsibilities defined

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,280
for subsequent steps

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,800
also procurement of higher resolution

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
satellite imagery identification of slum

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,520
boundaries

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,720
and setting up of online marketing

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,479
platforms using humanitarian

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,039
openstreetmap team tasking manager

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,639
and taking the orange step securing

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,520
assets to slump sites are negotiated

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,759
here

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,520
and also the core research teams in

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,199
partner countries are trained at this

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,800
stage

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,639
the online marketing stage involves

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,680
using the marketing platform to conduct

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,000
uh training sessions and marketings

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,199
to achieve complete uh digitization of

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,120
uh the areas

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,840
we authorize modbus due to our license

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,360
agreement with satellite imagery

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,360
provider the online validation stage

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,879
involves correcting any errors

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,000
identified during the online marketing

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,959
stage by experienced

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,959
mappers the gps field mapping stage

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,880
involves using handheld gps trackers to

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,680
track footpaths and road networks in the

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,440
area

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,959
with aim of validating what has already

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,240
been mapped and also identified

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,320
densifying the

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,680
network the collected data is used to

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,959
update the openstreetmap database at the

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,480
gps digitization stage we then use

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,800
printed field papers to verify the

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,360
structure geometry in the field

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,240
while recording a unique 13 digit

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,279
structure code

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,839
and taking field nodes using a tablet we

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,200
are using

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,240
two key open source tools on the tablet

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,760
open data kit open map kit

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,680
another open source technology being

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,560
used outside tablet is

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,200
filled papers the field repairs are then

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,560
scanned

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,680
and used to update openstreetmap

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,519
database online the structural codes and

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,760
fuel nodes are kept separate from the

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,440
openstreetmap database online

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,480
all sensitive data are stored in a

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,480
warwick open data kit aggregate server

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
only data declared uh public by

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,920
respondents are uploaded to

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,160
openstreetmap database

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,839
we end a few activities with key uh

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,959
three key

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,640
service using the collected spatial data

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,560
household health survey healthcare

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,360
facility survey and an in-depth

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,360
household survey

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,560
these are some photographs of the online

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,640
mapping events in bangladesh and nigeria

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,079
involving the local community ensures a

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,720
capacity building and multi-level

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,120
participation and mobilization

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
it is important to emphasize that local

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,480
knowledge is also relevant in these

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,880
events which allows

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,399
on-screen validation of most mapped

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,200
features

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,399
we usually search for any openstreetmap

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,360
some community groups

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,279
in the area and collaborate with them at

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,360
the time of mapping the study area

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,360
we did not find any existing open street

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,519
map community to help

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,959
but the mapping events created awareness

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,240
and interest among

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,920
local residents and researchers

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,079
bangladesh was completely different and

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,959
has a very strong and visible open

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,959
treatment community

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
also these are some sample photographs

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,959
of the field work in bangladesh and

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,959
kenya showing the involvement of the

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,200
local community

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,120
more open street community members in

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,040
bangladesh participated in the training

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,760
online mapping and field work done in

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,360
kenya and other countries

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,760
the fluent are the four categories of

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,240
healthcare facilities studied

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,240
four clinics and maternity centers 22

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,079
patent medicine stores

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,920
these are facilities for selling a

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,600
commercial product advertised as a

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,160
purported over-the-counter without

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,200

five traditional faith healers one eye

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,040
health center

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,880
or a facility where an optician is based

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,279
the world total here is 32 healthcare

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,600
facilities

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,399
literature suggests two main schools of

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
thought about

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,120
special proximity one school considers

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,560
proximity as a distance measure that can

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,120
sufficiently be described by

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,880
quantitative or qualitative distances

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,399
the other school aims at developing

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,000
proximity measures where distance

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,600
becomes a modifying factor

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,600
instead of the measure itself this study

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,279
is mainly about the former school of

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,000
thought

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,399
so for each healthcare facility in the

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,279
implemented distress

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,200
shortest path algorithm was used for the

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,360
computation

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,440

total eclipsing distance

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,120
i will now show some results

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,360
this map shows an example of an updated

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,399

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,160
have been uploaded

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,519
but this will be done by end of the

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,040
project

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,519
on the left you will see some of the

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,000

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,040
deviation of 219 meters

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,519
in this case the ground medians and

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,760
ground means for the two metrics differ

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,600
by over 100 meters similar to the

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,839
previous

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,279
same trend here route network distances

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,320
from most households to traditional and

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,839
fade healers are higher than the

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,440
euclidean metrics

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,839
the grand median for shortest network

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,079
distances is 589 meters and the same for

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,519
euclidean is 4.6 meters

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,760
the grand mean for the shortest route

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,440
network distance is 589 meters with a

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,519
standard division of 2

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,279
zero meters and the same for excluding

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,240
distance is four to eight with a

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,440
standard deviation of

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,880
of one and eight meters in this case the

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,279
ground medians and ground means

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,079
for the two metrics default by over 100

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,360
meters

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,199
similar to the previous shortest route

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
network distances from most households

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,199
to

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,720
eye health center are higher than the

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,320
euclidean metrics

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,560
the median for shortest route network

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,079
distance is 490 meters

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,920
and the same for euclidean is 372 meters

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,240
the mean for the shortest route distance

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,519
is 503 meters

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,720
um with a standard deviation of 204

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,279
meters and the same

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,000
for euclidean distance is 374 meters

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,480
with a standard deviation of 168 meters

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,320
clearly four categories of the medians

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,639
and means for the two metrics differ by

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,079
over 100 meters

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,279
the following are some of the lessons

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,880
learned from the use of

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,160
openstreetmap-based data collection

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,639
approach

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,839
where research teams need to host own

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,360
satellite imagery

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,959
effort must be made to investigate

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,120
carefully options for

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,440
both free and commercial tile services

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,279
vis-a-vis the imagery license

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,360
we provide here some examples of tyre

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,800
services we have come across

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,519
in this study the task service was

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,680
provided by the imagery provider

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,839
use of portable gps devices alone do not

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,680
work at the household level

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,600
careful training of mapping tools are

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,959
very vital for success

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,360
of implementing awesome based mapping

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,199
for health survey

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,800
use of filter papers played a key role

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,199
in data collection and cleaning

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,040
however using this technology require

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,600
careful planning

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,720
online mapping of road network and

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,800
well-known monuments

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,320
proved very useful for orientation in

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,240
the field

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,040
rooftop architecture of structures can

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,880
create difficulty during mapping

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,560
security for mappers should be a

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,000
priority and working with residents can

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,079
be extremely helpful in this regard

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,920
our openstreetmap-based method advances

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,519
humanitarian mapping practices

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,199
and addresses the two-fold challenge of

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,720
achieving equitable community engagement

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,720
while generating quality data for

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,480
research and decision making

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,639
ground truthing is essential for areas

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,120
with higher density of buildings

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,759
field validated data completeness

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,440
estimates

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,360
are usually less than online mapping

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,519
estimates for buildings

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,959
less dense areas can reasonably be used

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,480
as a sampling frame without ground

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,360
truthing

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,199
routes are easy to interpret useful and

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,160
must be mapped during the online mapping

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,319
stage

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,919
for roots field validated data

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,480
completeness estimates are usually more

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,160
than online mapping estimates

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,720
factors likely to influence quality

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,000
comprise density rooftop architecture

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,760
and mapping skills among others

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,280
in terms of haircare assets in the study

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,120
area our studies suggest

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,720
that residents can assess healthcare

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,640
facilities within a walking distance

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,640
that is under one kilometer

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,280
comparatively clinics and maternity

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,600
centers are fathers for most residents

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,200
even in this category one facility

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,120
stands out as the farthest which is

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,720
shasha primary health center

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,880
route network distances to healthcare

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,000
facilities are longer than the euclidean

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,320
distances

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,559
but there is a significantly strong

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,520
positive correlation between them

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,400
overall seniority index is 1.16

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,400
suggesting that

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,880
non-linear nature of network distances

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,480
to healthcare facilities contributes to

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,919
16 percent more than the euclidean

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,240
metric

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,080
finally this study advances the evidence

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,000
based on slum health towards achieving

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,480
sustainable development goal 3

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,080
and promotes the use of

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,600
openstreetmap-based mapping approach and

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,600
data for slum health research

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,559
we consider the following as potential

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,760
future opportunities for research

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,440
understanding how different

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,039
socio-demographic profiles of slum

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,440
residents have different accessibility

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,360
to healthcare provision

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,679
application of fear of change approach

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,080
in studying healthcare accessibility in

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,799
informal urban settlements

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,360
um combining participatory methods with

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,280
automated methods like machine learning

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,520
for for structure detection and

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,200
population estimation

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,640
here the validated openstreetmap

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,120
features can uh

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,640
serve as draining data or validation

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,480
data

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,320
improvement of workflows and mapping

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,200
tools in support of a methodological

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,120
framework for

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,840
geospatial mapping of health and

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,760
well-being in urban poor areas

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,280
lastly extending impact through our

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,480
potential future collaboration with

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,799
local partners

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,240
openstreetmap community and other

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,440
researchers for data usage

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,440
and further improvement

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,960
this research was funded by the national

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,320
institute for health research global

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,760
health research group on improving

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,679
health in slums

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,360
the views expressed in this presentation

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,919
are those of the authors

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,320
and not necessarily those of the nhs the

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,960
nihr or department of health

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,400
and social care thank you for your

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,919
attention and also many thanks to

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,720
volunteers from the openstreetmap

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,000
community

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,760
as well as project partners

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:53,840
collaborators and funder

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:53,840
for making this study a reality

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,280
hello everyone my name is gordon

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,480
you're live for questions thank you

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,320
thank you gordon that was a really

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,400
insightful uh presentation and my

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,440
questions are streaming in so oh yes i

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,280
can see it's going to be exciting

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,880
you can have a look at them as you are

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,840
reading them as well so let's start with

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,480
the first one

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,080
uh the topography did you uh consider

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,440
that because um

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,240
uh i think it you know the name is gone

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,720
now but then

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,240
in brazil as you know the favelas are

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,760
really really steep so one has to

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,400
consider the topography was that a

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,400
challenge for you

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,640
yes um that was something that we

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,320
thought about

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,840
um and um you know

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,400
the uh i think in our case uh especially

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,760
for this

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,640
particular study um this area is quite

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,480
um um different from uh the case raised

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,559
in this question and uh because of this

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,480
we did not really concentrate but i

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,840
i can care that this is really important

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,520
to consider when you're dealing with

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,600
distances similar to what

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,520
uh we consider in comparison with the

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,640
equivalent distance so certainly

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,159
um i agree that in the favelas in brazil

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,600
then certainly certainly

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,280
it has to be considered and and then

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,120
what about um security

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,880
related did you consider that well this

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,559
was the security of the mappers not the

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,600
community going to the health work

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,000
health here yeah exactly so this is uh

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,200
something

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,480
that um we carefully consider because um

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,520
um you know the the

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,360
the map is uh we have the risk uh two to

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,159
three uh members in the research core

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,480
team

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,760
and then we have also uh volunteers and

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,559
some of them are already within the

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,559
community

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,679
some are also helping so for example um

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,159
not necessarily here but

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,799
in um or maybe let me just talk about

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,760
this one so here uh in charshow you have

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,039
uh most of the map mostly uh

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,440
postgraduate students from

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,960
university of ibadan and certainly not

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,760
all of them were within the community i

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,799
mean in terms of

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,360
being a resident so um

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,799
these were issues that um you know we

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,200
tried balancing the

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,960
composition with local residents and

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,840
therefore once people get to know that

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,600
you know

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,280
their own is within the team and they

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,880
can easily relate then

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,039
it made it very um easy for for us to

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,720
address issues about security but it's

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,760
something that i learned also on the

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,760
project that um

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,600
you know islam as we know it is not

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,720
necessarily um security free and you

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,400
have to be

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,320
very conscious of this and also the fact

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,840
that you know this is an area where

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,039
um uh usually is considered as illegal

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,640
uh

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,880
or the people are usually considered as

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,120
illegal settlers in in some in some

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,240
situations so usually they are very

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,559
conscious of

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,520
any new phase or any new activity

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,000
happening there

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,039
so if you're mapping these areas and

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,840
things like that you know

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,760
even mapping then that's even more um um

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,440
sensitive because then you know

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,159
that the assumption is that you are

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,960
you're collecting building footprints or

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,480
land um uh you're demarcating the land

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,159
or sort of thing to

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,679
uh to cause some future uh

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,280
maybe relocation or something like that

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,559
they need to understand and things like

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,440
that

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,360
yeah i can i can appreciate that but on

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,880
the other hand also the security of the

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,480
community when they go to a health care

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
center did you consider that because i

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,360
mean

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,559
it could be a very short distance but a

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,120
very dangerous

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,600
route oh yeah certainly especially for

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,400
women

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,240
and women or yeah females in the in the

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,840
team and things like that so

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,679
um yeah certainly this is something that

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,919
we considered and um

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,080
we discussed with uh local partners to

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,080
make sure that um this is something that

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,200
um

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,039
is addressed then

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,240
the next question is about careful

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,320
training um

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,080
of mapping tools you mentioned that this

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,840
is very important

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,480
uh what are the lessons learned in best

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,200
best practices in terms of that

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,880
uh well so so this one was quite

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,039
interesting because the

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,400
for us in terms of you know it was not

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,720
just like um

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,080
uh what we most people usually do that

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,360
you know you just map and then you

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,360
upload to the

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,799
uh to the openstreetmap database and

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,760
things like that but we also wanted to

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,159
use it for survey

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,000
so that's the key thing that means that

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,320
the if you take for example

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,320
a household structure if you map it then

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,960
you have to also find a way to link

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,840
this to a particular code or something

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,840
that you can use

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:52,720
in a survey format so in our case

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:55,919
we had to use a 13 digit code

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,039
consisting of the

00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,640
first letter of the islam name field

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,080
paper code or sheet

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,520
code um innovation area last digits of

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,360
interviewer uh code um

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,559
serial numbering of the structures and

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,000
things like that so

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:17,039
in a way uh once that is done we we saw

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,120
this as the resilient component of even

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,520
for the for the for the

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,960
mapping process because then we were

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,240
always

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,559
able to uh uh go back and use

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,840
um the filter sort of as a reference

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,640
point to always

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,279
trace the uh what has been mapped right

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
from the

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,799
you know the server and all the other

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,279
data that we have

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,520
uh and even beyond that to the survey so

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,120
that was very

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,559
useful for that and also in terms of

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
training i would say that you know

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,400
because

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,039
um the other component of our

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,880
interest was to understand how all these

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,440
uh mapping tools open source mapping

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,400
tools

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,960
can be linked together to conduct this

00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,679
sort of

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,640
research based uh operational based um

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,679
data collection

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,159
and survey so um one thing is uh you

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,640
know the

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,559
the the people who are who are helping

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,919
especially the volunteers do not have

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,559
this tech uh

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,760
technical backgrounds and so even the

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,520
idea of uh

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,799
jumping from one tool to another so for

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,799
example you start with

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,919
hot tasking manager they eventually end

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,919
up filled papers

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,960
and then you go to josem and then you go

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,120
back and then

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,480
you know you go to idea editor and then

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,799
they do it and then

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,640
you know then even with that you have to

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,080
generate tiles and all sort of things

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,480
so there are so many tools that we're

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,200
trying to use and um this is something

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,080
that um

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,440
if you're not careful um you can be in

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,919
trouble in terms of the

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,440
the workflow yeah i think your

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,039
presentation also showed that you had a

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,480
careful plan of the different tools and

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,400
when to use them

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,240
um in that slide

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,760
another question that's come up here is

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,840
about um

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,960
you mentioned mapping footpaths and

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,080
roads

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,840
so do you think this project made a

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,600
considerable difference in the

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,200
in the coverage in that area and the

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,679
completeness or was there

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,240
already a good a great deal of data

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,200
before

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,919
you started well there are some few uh

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,559
data sets

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,240
especially for this one when we started

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,399
but uh most of them hadn't been

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,440
validated that's for the structures and

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,559
some of the

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,919
building uh world networks um and also

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,440
even for the health care facilities

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,039
actually uh it was completely

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,600
um not validated so um because our own

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,520
goal was

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,720
also with the healthcare facilities so

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,159
um this

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,919
these is something that we've we have

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,640
contributed actually i wanted to even

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,960
show

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,720
before and after maps just to clarify

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,840
this but i think in some of my previous

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,679
uh

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,840
presentations i think last year in the

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,200
same state of the map conference i think

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,760
i showed some of them

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,960
uh so um but basically that is but there

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,279
were instances where

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,320
uh for example i remember the the i

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,760
recall in uh

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,279
in the case of pakistan the site in

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,880
pakistan as ambassador there was

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,559
absolutely nothing um

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,480
there were buildings road networks there

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,880
but buildings were about three or so

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,320
and then we we had to map everything

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,880
from scratch

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,559
wow and and just an estimate the number

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,279
of buildings

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,679
thousands oh yeah thousands so this one

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,080
i think the building structures were

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,279
yeah in the thousands um but i'll say

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,120
that you know um

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,120
in terms of structures that's the case

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,880
but in terms of households

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,480
there's a difference between that you

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,919
know the you have structures all right

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,960
but then we are also interested in

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,320
dwellings so

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,039
out of the map structures we tried also

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,279
to

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,960
uh beyond the structure verification

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,960
identify also the dwellings because we

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,520
needed the households the allocations

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,880
to do the survey so i assume there were

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,799
more households than

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,919
dwellings yeah no there were more

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,600
certainly certainly yeah

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,440
there were over a thousand households

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,960
but then the in terms of

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,480
structures the dwellings the structures

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,240
or the structure of the households where

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,679
i think around

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,200
almost 700 um structures out of the

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,640
thousands but uh

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,320
for that number the household there were

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,360
more because certainly you know

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,080
you can have um uh more than one or two

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,960
uh

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,480
households in a structure the next

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,520
question is again about

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,720
the the um assessing the

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,840
accessibility to health facilities

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,880
so this question is about whether the um

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,720
the number of doctors or nurses uh for

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,399
the number of people in the vicinity was

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,159
considered so the size of that

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:34,559
uh health service oh yes uh so the

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,600
for the survey we have um collected a

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,200
lot of data

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,720
and probably that's also one of the

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,080
reasons why we had to carefully

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,840
design the workflow in such a way that

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,520
most of the data will go into a private

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,720
server and well-encrypted

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,559
database server so um yeah we have

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,399
we have we collected all sort of things

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,480
ownership

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,159
source of funding a number of doctors

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,039
number of nurses

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,760
pharmacies uh so for example the

00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,919
hurricane

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,480
facilities we collected things uh

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,120
categories like clinic centers uh dental

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,320
clinic hospital secondary care provider

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,159
residential

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,320
nursing care facility laboratory

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,159
pharmacy or medical store

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,480
general shop or chaos with healthcare

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,360
products transportation

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,159
uh traditional faith healer and others

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,919
so

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,760
there are a lot of categories for this

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,120
study we just you sort of is a super

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,240
grouping so we

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,320
uh we tried uh uh regrouping the those

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,480
from the raw data but uh

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,679
uh in terms of the hacker survey we have

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,720
a lot of variables that we are

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,240
constraining uh

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,399
for publications now for the study yeah

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,399
so so the next um question is about did

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,159
you encounter spatial heterogeneities

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,799
regarding possible drivers like social

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:48,480
demographics economics or something

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:50,880
um um so for this

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,760
um study for this one that i've just

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,279
presented is just

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,960
i would say early stages in terms of you

00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,080
know starting to explore the data that

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,120
we've collected

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,799
but in terms of the project we have in

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,120
fact that's one of the

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,360
objectives and i think in the earlier

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,480
slides that i showed um the

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,960
the the i think is a one of the um

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,399
objective uh it's actually a web package

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,799
um which is to

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,000
understand um healthcare assets um or

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,320
hurricane hurricane-seeking behaviors

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,760
so we are developing health economic

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,440
models and things like that so we are

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,640
certainly considering all these and

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,120
uh certainly um we want to also look at

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,919
um

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,720
like i pointed out in the future uh

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,320
opportunities for

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,519
research we want to look at how these

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:41,120
measures are linked to social

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,120
demographics that we've collected

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,799
so somebody's commented here and saying

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,919
that this kind of study shows

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,880
or exposes or reveals the serious

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,240
concerns

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,679
when people that are covered 19 infected

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,840
have to travel or to walk to health care

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,840
sites

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,120
have you got any comments about that i

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,279
guess

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,600
this study happened long before we had

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,559
the pandemic but maybe there were other

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,960
infectious diseases that you discussed

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,799
oh certainly this is something that uh

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,559
you know the project is ongoing and some

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,039
of the work packages there are other

00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:21,039
co-investigators like professor

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,799
francis griffith and for other warwick

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,600
medical school and

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,120
other experts on the project who are

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,960
looking at

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,480
this especially for the i think the last

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,039
work packet was about stakeholder

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,399
engagement

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,000
so um the the object the strategy now

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,320
has been uh to

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,279
shift focus to the coverage 19 uh

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,559
pandemic and

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,360
uh look at ways in which um the steady

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,399
can help

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,720
um especially in areas of uh creating

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,039
policy briefs uh with even the maps and

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,200
the

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,240
uh the findings that we have in fact uh

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,600
some of the

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,799
uh some of the uh uh some of the uh

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,120
in-country um stakeholders exploded out

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,960
we

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,240
are also interested in the data that we

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,640
have and we are interacting with them

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,399
yeah i can i can relate to that i mean

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,440
we are busy with a study here also in an

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,320
informal settlement

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,760
to just review whether all these rules

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,760
about social distancing

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,519
and all kinds of other measures that are

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,519
being put in place

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,720
if and how these are even possible in

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,159
some of these um

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,080
settlements i think that's a huge

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,279
challenge oh definitely

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,159
and i have seen even uh lots of uh

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,600
news um items around this you know how

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,279
how with this you know well

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,000
uh highly dense areas um how do they

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,000
actually

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,600
address uh or adhere to social

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,360
discussion that has been

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,120
uh distance measures or policies that

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,039
have been put in place by uh government

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,720
uh officials or the

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,159
um local authorities so this is

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,039
something that uh

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,640
uh yeah um is a hot issue now especially

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,679
in slums because you know because of

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,840
this

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,360
higher population or this dense

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,440
population uh

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,480
uh you know and the way we know about

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,919
covet you know

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,039
uh um one minister from ghana said uh if

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,720
if you move it moves you know so um

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,720
so far as people are moving and there

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,520
are a lot of them in a particular place

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,280
well you know the they also move and

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,639
this is something that uh

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,159
actually for me it's very interesting

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,520
that probably in the future we will look

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,599
into this

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,440
yeah and i think it starts with basic

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,200
things like access to water i mean if

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,679
you have communal tap sorry my cat is

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,679
joining us

00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:35,119
[Laughter]

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,480
yeah okay then i was i was also curious

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,919
to find out you did this

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,599
across the world i think that's very

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,200
interesting so how did

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,280
accessibility differ between the

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,119
different slums

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,359
oh yes this is something that uh we've

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,000
started uh we've started looking at um

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,960
this is just

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,760
um the start of the study uh in terms of

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,800
you know

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,680
um accessibility um uh um

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,359
uh studies or looking into the data that

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,720
we have so this is just uh one that

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,440
we've started with

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,400
and so we're going to probably look into

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,480
um

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,839
uh you know sort of a comparative study

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,359
you know for

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,400
you know looking at the data we have for

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,839
these seven sites

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,440
[Music]

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,040
and the challenges in terms of mapping

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,000
in the different countries were they

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,359
were they similar were they different oh

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,760
yeah very interesting so many

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,359
interesting things i think we in a way

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,280
uh we did not exhaust uh

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,960
all the lessons length actually uh on

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,400
the slides that we put there but uh

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,720
this is something we are looking at to

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,440
provide put together best practices or

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,160
things like that

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,880
around the lessons learned um but uh

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,400
yeah for

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,000
the sites there are interesting um um

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,920
lessons that we've learned so for

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,040
example if you take uh pakistan

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,480
uh pakistan has uh tall buildings

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,359
uh villain uh structures and uh

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,440
the rooftop is slightly different uh

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,680
compared to the others unlike you know

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,599
if you take i don't know whether yeah i

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,240
think i show some pictures for

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,320
sasha uh the the building structure in

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,520
the roof and it is quite standard in

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,839
terms of you know

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,800
uh in terms of digitization and trying

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,680
to trace

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,240
uh uh structures or you know read from

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,240
the

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,240
satellite imagery but in their case it

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,680
was a bit tricky and we didn't

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,880
actually we thought we were doing a good

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,560
job in the online marketing and

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,920
eventually realized that actually when

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,640
we went to the field uh

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,160
it was completely different um uh

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,960
because then you know there you there

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,040
you're there

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,880
at the you know looking at the building

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,359
you can see the top but

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,720
uh but then you can figure out even uh

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,160
what it means you know you can't

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,839
you can what you've mapped on like you

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,000
can't figure out what it is on the

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,160
ground yeah you can see the block

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,079
i mean with the road the word was real

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,400
networks were very uh useful because you

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,040
could

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,599
easily navigate but if the structure

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,119
stands

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:52,800
uh this is very difficult to um

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,800
sort of uh uh you know figure out the

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,880
households living in each

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,480
uh structure and it's difficult to

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,160
figure out which structure is which

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:06,160
and things like that from the mat uh um

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,480
from the uh paper online map that we uh

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,760
we uh printed and went uh took to the

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,680
field

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,680
so so i assume that's also why you had

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,440
to in those dance areas go back into the

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,240
ground truth thing because

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,800
um what you see on the satellite image

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,320
could

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,160
it looks like one building but it could

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,760
be a couple of buildings and a couple of

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:28,160
awesome definitely yeah i agree

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,920
i agree so we put it there maybe for

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,680
less dense areas that's quite relative

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,359
though but less dense areas

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,960
like shasha then maybe that's sports

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,400
because i mean

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,599
you can easily see uh the buildings and

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,359
then you can easily

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,760
probably figure out that

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,560
you can uh you can you can use it for

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,720
surveys

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,240
but um it also is quite dynamic it

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,160
depends on everything for example

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,520
bangladesh um it's a little bit tricky

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,440
because

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,640
this the site the place is very dynamic

00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,000
and uh

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,440
so you have to be careful in terms of um

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,160
uh uh using the data for example without

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,680
uh

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:12,000
sort of uh field validation

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,320
yeah yeah otherwise it's um yeah

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,160
um i had a question oh yeah you said

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,720
something about

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,040
that gps on its own it was in monica

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,800
slides gps on its own doesn't work well

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,400
what did you mean by that so you had to

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,960
do field papers and

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,760
things like that exactly exactly that's

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,800
what i mean

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,520
so the the gps uh

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,920
we tried uh using it and uh it was a bit

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,960
uh

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,760
difficult to you know uh uh

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,960
uh link this to every household i'm

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,359
using just the

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,680
the locations and uh and because also

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,599
you know i think um

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,599
you're also in in dramatics so you

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,440
understand how gps works and uh

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,960
i think probably most uh people are

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,240
listening to us uh

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,520
are those in the gis field

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,440
so the the the the structures because

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,000
they are also dense and the

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,280
the the the sky is not that open enough

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,760
to allow

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,960
uh the communication between the device

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,280
and uh

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,560
and the satellites above and so

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,920
certainly

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,839
you get the first impression that

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,440
actually you're mapping or you're at the

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,359
either other structure you've mapped

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,200
you're clear on it but then

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,640
you end up seeing the point somewhere

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,720
else so uh

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,160
because it's not really computed well um

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,760
so that place is very

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,040
bad and so uh we used uh eventually we

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,800
that was one of the reasons why we used

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,079
field papers and also i wanted to vision

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,800
where we use the tablets and

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:41,920
uh also um uh off uh uh

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,720
tile uh sort of tiles for the for the

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,400
tablet so

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,760
we loaded everything there after we had

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,680
prepared it from the

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,440
um uh from the online marketing and the

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,400
field but they uh filled um

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,000
um uh validation uh luxury thing so we

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,839
put everything on uh

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,839
on the on the tablet and then we went

00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,920
there so the gps

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,920
i would say technology was used just as

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,800
a guide so it was guiding us to roughly

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,160
you know figure out

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,560
in terms of orientation you know the

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,040
rules were helping but also the gps

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,760
helped

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,160
to figure out roughly where you are and

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,960
then

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,839
you have to interpret what you have you

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,960
have mapped

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:20,240
you know the paper and also the um the

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,160
um the tires on the on the tablets to um

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,560
arrange yourself and make sure that you

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,560
are really

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,240
seeing the right structure before you

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,480
start

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,760
um recording or you start collecting

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,680
data so

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,359
that's why i think somewhere i mentioned

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,040
or i put the um

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,640
that road networks or well-known

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,640
monuments were very useful

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,680
so you know once you get you get to that

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,920
where you really

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,359
really sure you are well oriented in the

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,359
other position then you can start from

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:56,319
there

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,760
thank you thank you uh godwin i think we

00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,839
have to wrap up we need

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,280
another few minutes of a break before we

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,200
go on to the next

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,480
presentation that was really excellent

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,760
excellent work that you're doing

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,760
um i think i would like to encourage you

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,960
to write that up because i think it's

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,040
very useful for

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,800
many people in other parts of the world

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,359
to work out how to work

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,240
with openstreetmap and capturing these

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,000
settlements

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:34,160
so thank you very much thank you very

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:34,160
