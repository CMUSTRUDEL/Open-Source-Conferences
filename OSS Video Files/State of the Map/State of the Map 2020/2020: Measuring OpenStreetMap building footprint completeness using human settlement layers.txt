Non-government organizations and local government units use geographic data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to target humanitarian aid and public services. As more people start to depend on OSM, it is important to study data completeness in order to identify unmapped regions so that OSM volunteers can focus their attention on these areas. In this study, we propose a method to measure the data completeness of OSM building footprints using human settlements data.

Non-government organizations and local government units use geographic data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to target humanitarian aid and public services. As more people start to depend on OSM, it is important to study data completeness in order to identify unmapped regions so that OSM volunteers can focus their attention on these areas. In this study, we propose a method to measure the data completeness of OSM building footprints using human settlements data.

Specifically, we use Facebook’s High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL), a dataset of built-up areas derived from satellite images, as a proxy for ground truth building footprints. We then measure data completeness by getting the “percentage completeness” of pixels which is computed using the total percentage of pixels within the intersection of the human settlement layer and the OSM building footprints. The method can be broken down into three steps: (1) convert the human settlement layer into a vector; (2) perform a spatial join to find the intersection between the vectorized human settlement layer and the building footprints; and (3) calculate the data completeness based on pixels from the vectorized human settlement layer that intersect with the building footprints.

Chepeish and Polchlopek [1] conducted a similar study measuring data completeness in OSM building footprints. We differentiate our work from Chepeish and Polchlopek [1] in three ways. First, for the human settlement layers, Chepeish and Polchlopek [1] used WorldPop which has a spatial resolution of 100 meters [2] while we used the High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL) from Facebook which has a spatial resolution of 30 meters [3]. Second, for the data processing, their group rasterized the building footprints while our group vectorized the human settlement layer. Third, for calculating the data completeness, their group used a combination of geographic information system (GIS) and machine learning (ML) while our group solely used GIS.

Using building footprints from January 2020 and human settlement layers dated June 2019 and October 2018, the percentage completeness is 32.75% and 10.89% for the Philippines and Madagascar, respectively. We found that in the Philippines, most of the unmapped pixels are in rural areas. When the pixels are aggregated to the municipality-level and plotted as a scatter plot of the urban percentage completeness vs. the rural percentage completeness, the municipalities appear to group together into two categories: sparsely mapped and thoroughly mapped. A possible explanation is that there are not enough OSM volunteers to map all municipalities and the OSM community focuses on thoroughly mapping high population municipalities rather than moderately mapping all municipalities. Interestingly, poverty incidence data from the Philippine Statistics Authority is not correlated with data completeness. Complete or incomplete OSM data in an area is not an indicator of wealth or poverty.

As this work has garnered interest from humanitarian organizations such as the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM), to whom regularly updated information on OSM data completeness is extremely valuable, we looked into ways to automate workflows in QGIS by using the built-in workflow builder tool (i.e. Processing Modeller) and by using the QGIS API. However, as we consider scalability and reproducibility important for this line of work, we ultimately deemed QGIS to be unfit for our use case. QGIS is not scalable because the data processing is not easily parallelizable and it is also not easily reproducible by developers who do not have training with GIS software. Thus, we decided to migrate our workflow to GeoPandas and rasterio and open-source our code [4]. Our workflow improved because (1) we were able to speed up the process by migrating to the cloud and increasing the computing resources; and (2) we were able to improve the reproducibility by allowing us to communicate our work more effectively to people who aren’t familiar with GIS.

For future research, we recommend exploring other human settlement datasets The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), for example, has a spatial resolution of 30 meters [5] which is comparable to WorldPop and HRSL. We also encourage further data analysis on the percentage completeness in order to get insights on how to improve the process of contrib

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,360
using gis to medical organizations

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,640
to make data-driven decisions he has

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,879
worked with unicef

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,560
the competing research institute in

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,480
different companies throughout

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,959
southeast asia to provide business

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,480
insights and to solve research problems

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,120
using spatial analysis

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,159
and web mapping his research interests

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,680
include gis

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,159
data science deep learning with

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,319
satellite image and remote sensing

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:15,519
and today he's gonna present a

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,560
new method for uh based on human

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,920
settlement

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,920
layers and gis operations to assess the

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,280
completeness of building footprints

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,680
so let's watch the um

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,680
the top

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,200
good day everyone my talk today will be

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
about

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,159
a problem that we worked on that

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,159
involved openstreetmap and gis

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,120
just an introduction my name is ardy

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,560
ordin i work as a geospatial analyst at

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,400
the consultancy in the philippines

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,319
called thinking machines

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,480
our company helps our clients make

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,560
better data-driven decisions through

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,319
business intelligence data warehousing

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,720
and data science

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,159
my role is to provide domain expertise

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,959
with gis using

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,640
spatial analysis and web mapping the

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,599
slides for this talk can be found in

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,120
this bitly link

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,120
shown on the screen i'm excited to get a

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,319
chance to use gis to solve different

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,080
types of problems

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
and today i'm going to talk about one of

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,160
the problems that we worked on

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,919
this problem is about finding where

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,840
unmapped areas are

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,720
and i'll be talking about the method and

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,639
the tools that we used

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
so as some of you might know there's a

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,320
map of the world called

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,759
openstreetmap or osm what's the

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,880
difference between this

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,160
and google maps there's basically three

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,120
main differences

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,360
openstreetmap is free editable and the

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
data is available to anyone

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,680
but for this talk the most important

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,120
thing to remember is the fact that

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,800
openstreetmap or osm is editable

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,040
there's a whole community of people who

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,639
contribute osm similar to

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,080
like wikipedia osm is very comprehensive

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,160
and there's a lot of data

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,680
that people contribute there's data

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,840
about hospitals

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,240
schools malls roads buildings mountains

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,840
rivers and plenty of others

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,400
and there are a lot of map changes that

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,479
are happening every day

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,039
because of the amount of data there are

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,680
a lot of important uses for it now

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,320
for example different organizations use

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,520
osm

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,240
to plan relief efforts during disasters

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,560
in the past osm was used to help with

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
the response to the 2010 earthquake in

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,840
haiti

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,880
the 2014 typhoon haiyan in the

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,919
philippines

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,080
and the ebola outbreaks in africa on the

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,800
public service side i've met some civil

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,199
servants

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,800
from the philippines who have said that

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,960
they use osm

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
to improve their public services to

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,560
their citizens

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,360
we have to remember though that there's

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,840
only a limited number of volunteers

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
and they can only map so much and there

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,120
are still a lot of areas where there are

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
no maps

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
and we believe that these unmapped areas

00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,840
are a problem

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,880
especially if there are people living

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,440
there because whenever there's disasters

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,039
those people will be neglected the

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,160
reason is because no one knows where

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,280
their houses are

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,000
no one knows where they live and since

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,919
no one knows where they are in general

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,360
the organizations giving out aid won't

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,360
be able to reach these people

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,880
there's actually a need to map the

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,560
unmapped areas

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,240
in the philippines there's an active

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,759
community of people who contribute to

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,000
osm

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,759
we wanted to help them by number one

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,840
showing where the mapped areas

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,160
and unmapped areas are and number two

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,759
measuring how much needs to be mapped

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,759
still

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,080
what we're measuring is the completeness

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,919
of the data

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,639
we decided to focus on measuring the

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,880
completeness for building footprints

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,400
we did some digging and we found that

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,000
there's a previous work where they

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,680
measured the completeness of building

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,960
footprints

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,919
and they did this using a mix of gis

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,280
and machine learning or ml and this is

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,560
where our work comes in

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,919
we present a modified methodology that's

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,080
simpler to implement

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,319
and still provides insights regarding

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,880
unmapped areas

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,639
our proposed methodology has three steps

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,199
i'll explain each step so that it's

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,120
easier to understand

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,120
the first step is vectorizing the

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,080
settlement layer

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,479
a settlement layer is an image about

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,960
areas in the world where people live

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,319
i included that image here at the right

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,199
side so that you can see what the

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,199
settlement layer looks like

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,360
the settlement layer came from the

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,280
facebook data for good project

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,120
so it's an initiative by facebook to

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,160
release open data for

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,599
everyone's benefit the data of a

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,039
settlement layer

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,840
is like the black things that you see

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,240
here

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,879
so these are the pixels of that image

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,319
each black pixel that you see is an area

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,360
with a population

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,000
in other words each pixel shows where

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,120
people live

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,759
that's the explanation for the

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,039
settlement layer the explanation for

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,280
vectorizing

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,599
is that it's a processing step that

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,240
involves turning the image

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,840
into a different data type so you're

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,639
just converting the data type

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,080
of the image and we do this so that we

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,599
can perform the next step

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,240
which is the spatial join

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,759
so a spatial join is a way to join two

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,800
data sets using

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,800
their spatial relationship so the

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,560
spatial relationship that we're using is

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,479
called the intersection and it's just

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,760
like what it sounds

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,800
that's the technically complete

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,160
definition of a spatial join

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,440
but the other explanation is that it

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,000
it is a way to find the intersection of

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,080
the settlement layer and the osm

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,160
buildings

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,680
as you can see in the image there are

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,320
black pixels which are

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,600
the settlement layers so here in the

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,600
image in the right side

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,920
and there are also green polygons which

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,600
are the osm buildings

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,519
the output of this step is the

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,279
intersection of the settlement layer in

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,880
the osm buildings

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,839
i'll go to the next slide to show what

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,320
the output looks like

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,120
that's what it looks like let me go back

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,120
just to compare

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,640
here the output shows which areas are

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,440
mapped

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,160
the one in blue and also which areas are

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,200
unmapped

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,399
the one in orange this output is then

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,399
used for the next step

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,160
the third step which is calculating the

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,000
percentage completeness

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,920
the formula is simple it's just

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
arithmetic based on the number of pixels

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,600
that

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,279
intersect with the osm buildings

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
those are the three steps in the

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,360
methodology the main assumption behind

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
the method is that the settlement layers

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,959
can be used

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
as a proxy ground truth the settlement

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,920
layers

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,320
are giving the location of built up

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:18,000
areas so in a sense they're giving up

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,920
the location of the population

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,279
made a web map to show the output for

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,480
the philippines

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,680
and here's a screenshot orange means

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,320
that it's unmapped

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,839
and blue means that it is mapped one

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,959
cool thing that we did is to show a

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,880
button that will link you to

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,880
openstreetmap if you want to contribute

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,640
try it out later and see it for yourself

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,320
you can access it at

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,320
mapthegap.singingmachines

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
you can zoom in and check out which

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,399
areas are mapped and then map and so

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
on we also wrote a blog post about this

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,880
so that we could share our work with

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
others

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,600
and what's interesting is that the

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,880
mapbox community team reached out to us

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,959
and they asked us to do it for

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,600
madagascar as well

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,240
you can check out both the blog and the

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,720
website

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,519
with the madagascar data in the site

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,800
below

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,800
in the links below i mean

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,920
i did mention earlier that there is a

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,720
previous work that measured data

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,800
completeness for osm building footprints

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,320
this previous method was created by a

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,880
group from a company called

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,880
azavea and they did this in partnership

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,720
with development seed

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,040
development seed is a mapping company

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,120
that works with non-profits and

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,959
they measure data completeness in order

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,680
to understand the progress

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,880
and completeness of malaria campaigns in

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,760
africa

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,760
you can check out their repository on

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,760
github

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,640
and you can find out more details about

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,160
their methodology over there

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,839
to summarize the differences there are

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,120
like three main differences

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,160
between the methodologies first

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,000
is that they used world pop instead of

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,200
the facebook high settlement layer or

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,680
hrsl

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,959
for their settlement layer and just to

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,320
clarify

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,160
uh both settlement layers used machine

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
learning to detect built up areas from

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,240
satellite images

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,079
that's a given the difference is in the

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,000
resolution

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,240
the difference is that world pop has a

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,959
lower resolution which is 100 meters per

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,519
pixel

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,600
as compared to hrsl which is 30 meters

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,920
per pixel

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,920
hrsl was only available for a few

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,560
countries in africa during the time that

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,560
development seed did their study

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,680
when we did our study it was available

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,440
for more countries

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,519
and we believe that it would be

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,160
interesting and useful

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,160
to use hr and cell instead of worldpop

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,760
second is in the pre-processing they

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,320
rasterize their buildings instead of

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,399
vectorizing their settlement layer

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,000
the settlement layer they used let's

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
recall has a settlement layer has a

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,680
resolution of 100 meters

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,040
and they were concerned with the

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,800
resolution difference with the buildings

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,639
on the other hand the resolution of the

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,760
settlement layer we used

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,680
was 30 meters and because their solution

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,760
is higher

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,160
the difference in the difference between

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,040
that and the building resolution

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,120
is not as big of an issue

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,560
the third is with the data completeness

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,399
calculation

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,120
they used machine learning to predict

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,600
the data completeness

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,880
and we use arithmetic so both

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,480
methodologies

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,480
did use gis both both methodologies got

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,959
the intersection of the settlement layer

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,760
with low sm buildings however they

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,440
proceeded to give the outputs of the gis

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,399
model to a linear regression model

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,760
in contrast we gave the outputs of the

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,639
gis model

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,440
to just do arithmetic and the advantage

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,040
of

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,880
using this is that it's simpler to

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,639
implement and

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,839
it still provides insights regarding

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
where unmapped areas are

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,240
now we get to the results based on the

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,519
building footprints from january 2020

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,560
the percentage completeness is 32.75

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,600
for the philippines and 10.89

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,519
for madagascar this indicates that there

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,920
are still a lot of unmapped areas in

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,320
these two countries

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,680
just some notes number one the human

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,000
settlement layer

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:36,000
is dated june 2019 for the philippines

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,600
and october 2018 for madagascar

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,120
so the percentage completeness if we use

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,240
a different date for the settlement

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,560
layer might be

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,560
slightly different as mentioned earlier

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,720
percentage completeness is calculated

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,040
using the arithmetic of map pixels and

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,880
on that pixels

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,800
we'd like to note though that this means

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,160
that percentage completeness is a

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,079
correlated metric

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,760
for building footprint completeness but

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,440
it's only a proxy

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,800
the pixels don't have a one-to-one

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,240
correspondence with the building

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,920
footprints

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,240
as yes you might have recalled from the

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,680
image earlier there are times where a

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,440
single pixel

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,120
has multiple building footprints in it

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
but for the philippines we did some

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,800
analysis on the relationship

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,600
between data completeness and

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,079
urbanization so most of our analysis

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,680
is going to be on the philippines and in

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,839
the philippines we found that most of

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,160
the unmapped areas are rural

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,120
a large number of level 4 admin

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,839
boundaries

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,120
have a percentage completeness of less

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,519
than 10

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,880
for rural areas and this makes sense

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,800
since most of the

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,279
most of the philippines is tagged as

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,279
rural

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,600
each admin boundary in the philippines

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,720
has a tag whether it's urban or whether

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,120
it's rural

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,240
and this is for the level 4 admin

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,079
boundary

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,399
what we decided to do next is to

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,839
aggregate it to a larger admin boundary

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,040
the level three one which is

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,199
the municipality level we then plotted

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,079
the rural percentage completeness versus

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,560
the urban percentage completeness

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,320
here we see that the municipalities

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
appear to group together into two

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,440
categories

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,880
one is barely mapped the one on the

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,480
lower left

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,560
and the other one is thoroughly mapped

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,480
the one on the upper right

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,920
and we believe that this is revealing of

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,959
the way the osm

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,880
community maps areas a possible

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,000
explanation is that the osm community

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,639
focuses on

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,759
thoroughly mapping one municipality

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,680
first

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,519
and focusing on the high population

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,160
municipalities

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,240
rather than focusing on mapping

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,240
everything equally

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,600
our analysis of this is that it's in the

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,519
interest of time

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,079
because there's only so much mapping

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,120
that volunteers can do

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,040
so that's why there are still a lot of

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,839
areas here in the lower left that are

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,120
yet to be

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,959
fully mapped and again

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,560
analysis for the philippines we took a

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,640
look at the relationship between data

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,160
completeness and poverty

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,280
we took poverty incidence data from 2015

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,919
at the municipality level this is taken

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,839
from national statistics

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,480
interestingly poverty incidence is not

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,199
correlated with data completeness

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,799
what this means is that whether or not a

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,959
municipality

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,960
has complete or incomplete osm data

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,960
it's not an indicator of whether that

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,440
municipality will be wealthy or whether

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,880
it will be poor

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,640
of course we'd like to note that a

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,840
caveat of this analysis is that

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,360
the poverty data is from 2015 and the

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,960
percentage completeness is for 2020.

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,760
so it may be that there are actually

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,640
areas now that are richer or are poorer

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,200
and the data completeness will reflect a

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
more

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,240
understandable trend

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,960
we also created a bivariate corrupt map

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,160
to visually look at the poverty

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,799
incidence

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,880
with respect to data completeness and

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,799
here we do see that there is a spatial

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,600
trend in the sense of the poverty

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,480
incidence

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,559
so in the northern part there is low

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,080
poverty incidence in the southern part

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,160
of the philippines there is a high

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,080
poverty incidence

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,799
in terms of data completeness though

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,200
there is no apparent trend

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,320
so this is in line with the graph shown

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,919
earlier

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,320
so there are areas that are poor but

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,679
have

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,160
completely mapped and areas that are

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,520
rich

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:39,360
but are not yet mapped and

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,120
although this is like a visual analysis

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,760
we recommend doing a

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,840
more rigorous uh data analysis and

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,360
spatial analysis on this

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,360
uh something interesting might be

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,720
looking at just one

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,080
area locally since if you look at one

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,000
area locally like for example the

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
southern part of the philippines you

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,720
might see a sort of a trend

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,760
or a relationship with the completeness

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,760
and the poverty then

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,160
so that's it for the analysis and i'd

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
like to double back on the

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,520
implementation of the method so

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,679
initially the implementation of the

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,080
method was done in qgis

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,039
and for those who aren't familiar qgis

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,240
is a software

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,679
slash program for doing gis and it has a

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,520
user interface

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,520
and what this means is that it's easy to

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,640
prototype whatever you can think of

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,360
and it's also easy to view your data at

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,840
first

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,400
our goal was just to create a web map in

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,919
the blog post and that was it

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,520
create that and then share the results

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,840
of that for the philippines

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,799
in that sense we were successful at the

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,520
same time though

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,360
we wanted to do more for example members

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,480
of the humanitarian open street map team

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,160
or hot osm

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,880
asked us if it would be possible to

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,440
update the results more frequently

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,240
and we also started thinking about

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,919
getting the

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,960
completeness results for all of the

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,960
countries that have hrsl data

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,159
basically we want to improve the

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,320
reproducibility and the scalability

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,720
of the implementation we looked into

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,080
ways into automating the workflows in

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,159
qgis

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:19,039
and also using the qgis api

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,200
however we wanted to increase the

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,559
scalability and the reproducibility

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,080
and we realized that qgis was unfit

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,360
for our use case qgis is not easily

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,159
scalable because

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,880
the data processing is it's just in one

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,000
computer

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,080
and it's not easily parallelizable doing

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,039
it in qgis is also not easily

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,960
reproducible

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,200
especially if people do not have

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,679
training with gis software

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,240
so we decided to migrate our workflow to

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,559
geopandas and raster io instead

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,400
you can check out the source code on the

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,400
github link down here in the left

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,240
yeah you can file issues and pull

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,559
requests there

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,640
and yeah we migrated the implementation

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,320
and we were able to speed up the

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,159
workflow um

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,039
so the reasons that you were able to

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,039
speed it up are because number one

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,799
we were able to migrate to the cloud and

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,200
increase the compute resources this is

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,480
the biggest one so now that our code is

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,320
in python

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,679
we could just put it in a virtual

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,600
machine and then

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,679
increase the compute resources of that

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,840
virtual machine and then it would run

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,520
fast number two for the reason and

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,159
speeding up the workflow is that

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,679
we now have python for all of our

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,600
end-to-end stuff

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,360
now that everything is in python we can

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,280
do the data downloading the data

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,280
processing and the data analysis

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,440
all in one place we're doing it all in

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,960
python it's more efficient that way

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,720
and i think another useful thing with

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,600
migrating to python is

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,760
improving the shareability of our work i

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,760
personally believe that gis is going to

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,039
be even more interdisciplinary in the

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,280
future

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,200
and by releasing our work in python

00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,760
we're able to reach people outside the

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,240
gis

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,799
community people like researchers

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,799
software engineers and data scientists

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,679
and people from all different types of

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,679
research fields

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,760
just a close i'd like to mention our

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,600
next steps

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,520
the first is to get the percentage

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,520
completeness for all countries that have

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,520
hrsl data

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,000
um if you're interested in getting that

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,240
data as well for whatever purpose

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
um you can find that in the link here in

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,000
the lower left

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,880
that data is in the humanitarian data

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,559
exchange

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,120
it's available under the facebook

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:38,720
organization so facebook releases

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,080
their data there the second is to set up

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,039
a data pipeline to get

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,520
frequently updated results so we already

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,159
have code for the methodology

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,360
and we can already run the code to get

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,520
the results

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,120
and what the data pipeline will do is to

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,400
just make sure that the code runs

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,280
frequently and that

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,280
we get our results frequently and the

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,280
web maps will be updated to show the

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,039
most recent data

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,880
so there's a lot of engineering

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,840
challenges there

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,360
but we're looking to work on it in the

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,600
future

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,159
and that's basically it for the talk we

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,320
just like to give a special thanks to

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,320
the philippine osm community for all of

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,000
their contributions to the map

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,840
we encourage everyone to try out the

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,480
method and see the results for your own

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,000
countries

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,679
and i'm sure that sharing the results

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,280
with your local osm community would be

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,840
appreciated

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,840
we'd also like to thank hot osm this

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,440
work is driven by our desire to help out

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,760
hot osm in their goal

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,640
to map the entire philippines and we're

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,080
glad to help in whatever way we can

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,799
we'd also like to thank everyone at

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,520
thinking machines for giving us feedback

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,240
on our work and thank you all for

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,279
listening

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,120
you can check out our work at github and

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,360
you can check the slides from the stock

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,200
in this bitly link shown here

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,039
i'll now be taking questions but if

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,919
you'd like to get in touch with me after

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,440
this talk

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:05,840
you can email me at rd thinking machines

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,840
thank you so much for your attention

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,240
okay thank you adi for another

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,720
interesting

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,600
talk i can see in the in the fed that

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,120
are quite a

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,960
few questions i uh personally appreciate

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,360
uh your contribution to the body of work

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,360
considers building completeness by

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,480
presenting a

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,000
very approachable uh method that is

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,120
easy to follow and seems to be easy to

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,720
implement so uh thank you for that

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,760
um i'll try let's start with a few

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,600
uh questions that um

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,720
um like uh basic even technical ones

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,000
like uh fear is asking how how long were

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,760
you able to process

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,880
the whole data in the philippines and

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,279
um felix uh asked whether it's

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,880
the the completeness dataset are

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,760
available for download

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,559
uh for masters and the philippines

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,760
oh okay hi thank you everyone for

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,679
attending the talk and i'm really

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,400
thankful for the organizers for

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,400
helping out as well as the editors um to

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,520
answer the question about how long it

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,880
took

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:34,640
so we ran it in a virtual machine with

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,520
around 8 cpus and like around 64 gigs of

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,559
ram

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,840
um we took us around like

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,279
two hours to do it for the entire of the

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:47,360
philippines

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:50,000
and then regarding the data set for the

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,640
data completeness we have the data set

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,200
available

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,960
in our website it's that map the gap

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,159
that thinking machines

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,120
um so yeah you can check out the data

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,120
completeness for

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,200
philippines there um right now we don't

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,600
have data completeness for madagascar

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,559
but

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,880
um we're hoping to release it for there

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,240
as well

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,799
okay thank you uh so anyone interested

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,320
can

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:19,600
start exploring that um i see there's

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,159
a bunch of questions about um

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,520
the settlement layer and the uh facebook

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,360
settlement

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,720
um about its accuracy

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,679
and i would add the the temporal

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,880
dimension how

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,400
frequently it's being updated especially

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,960
as open street map is

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,520
hopefully being updated in those areas

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,520
uh

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:47,039
more frequently probably um

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,159
yes so another question is about

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,880
um the the settlement layer focuses on

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,400
mapping population and

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,320
so um did you treat this and whether

00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,799
that affects your method so in other

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,600
words

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,120
uh your method is good in identifying uh

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,520
false negatives meaning

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,240
places where buildings should have been

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,120
mapped but

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,080
weren't mapped but what about uh what

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,240
you would consider

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,080
false positives uh buildings in

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,720
openstreetmap that don't appear in the

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,480
settlement

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,000
layer yeah so

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,840
i think that's a limitation of the

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,799
current method um

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,960
so right now i think it's probable if

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,440
you just add in a processing step

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,320
to solve the problem with the false

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,840
positive

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,000
i think we're going to be working on it

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
um

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,919
but yeah i think it's something that we

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,520
have to discuss on how we're going to

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:45,120
approach so thank you for the suggestion

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,159
um okay um let's see

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,080
um what did i skip uh you said that

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,520
building that uh are required to know

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,679
where people live

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,679
but if you're for example an aid

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,559
organization want to find out

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,440
where people live could you not also

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,600
look at

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,480
india's residential highway residential

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,320
objects

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,000
you know this treatment since these are

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,919
easier to add for mappers than

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,399
tracing buildings questioned by

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,399
frederick

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:18,320
yeah yeah i think the reason that

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,440
we did that exposition is just to

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,279
explain

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,799
like some of the motivations for doing

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,360
the building completeness

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,880
research right um i do think that it

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,159
would be easier

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,720
if uh the humanitarian organizations use

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,480
the

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,080
like the languages residential tag and

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,520
whatnot um

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,679
i think we also have to check um

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,799
like if this data is available for like

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,000
different countries right

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,760
because i don't know if all the

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,960
countries have like a landlord for

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,120
residential

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,720
and i do understand that of course it's

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,960
like a limitation because for example

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,480
there are some people who don't have

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,240
like who don't live in buildings or

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,600
don't have houses right so

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,600
that's something that you should also

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,559
consider but yeah i think um

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,480
we we will definitely check out like

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,840
training land use residential and

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,559
other osm tags

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,399
okay great did you know that you were

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,600
still thinking about how extending your

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,200
method

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,799
um let's see um

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,720
does your method considered different

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,039
the different population density some

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,559
buildings may have one story some may be

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,679
skyscrapers

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:28,080
so pixel a certain value for the

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,000
population may mean different things

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,679
the same completion can fit in one

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,120
building or lots of them depending on

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,520
the number of floors

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,520
so uh do you consider that in any way

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,720
um i no right now no um

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,200
i think the goal of the work right now

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,000
is just

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,720
uh like just like a proof of concept to

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,960
show that

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,640
um this is like a method that could work

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,880
and it's kind of simple to understand

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,480
that's also what we're trying to go for

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,559
here um it's something that's simple to

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,000
understand um

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,440
simple to implement because you know if

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,799
you're going to consider like the

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,279
building density i think

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,559
the complexity will be like a bit higher

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,840
so

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,320
yeah um yeah um i think it's something

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,440
that we

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,440
will also be considering

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:25,919
um okay um there's one

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,360
uh critical comment saying that

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:32,080
um um that you have to be

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,799
a customer of facebook in order to uh

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,559
acquire

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:39,679
uh access to this settlement layer

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,720
and thereby questions the

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,399
fitness of this layer to a project like

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:49,279
openstreetmap

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,679
um also since facebook

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,399
maybe breaking the walls so could you

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,679
explain

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,240
or discuss more the how this

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,960
layer is available and whether you have

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,480
to be a customer or not

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,120
wrong sure um

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,919
the data set is actually publicly

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,519
available

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,679
so facebook has a they prefer

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,799
uh data for good arm um where they

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,519
release

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,480
um like public data sets for reverence

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,399
benefit

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:26,080
um yeah i think the

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,399
the challenge really is um just um

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,720
finding out how to use it right and also

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,600
like the temporal aspect of it because

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,720
um they're going to be detecting these

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,080
buildings but the

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,559
it might it might be for like a

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,440
different year like it might be for 2018

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,480
or maybe even older and at the same time

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,200
i guess um

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,640
some some other things that you you can

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,320
also consider is like the satellite

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,440
images the aerial images

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,799
that they use um these are like they're

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,679
their own um so they just use that to

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,399
to like predict like where the buildings

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,279
are

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,880
but the output of the settlement layer

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,600
it's free available for everyone

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,120
it's actually in like a humanitarian

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,960
data exchange so if you check for

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,679
facebook data and humanitarian data

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,640
exchange

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:16,799
you'll see that it's publicly available

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,320
okay thanks for this clarification i

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,200
think um

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,559
uh corporate editors and corporate

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,919
contributions

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,039
and using corporate data is um sometimes

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,720
controversial

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,720
each controversial issue in

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,720
openstreetmap and um

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,760
um i'll promote the last talk of the

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,039
check right now by channing sanderson

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:43,840
which would discuss this um so yeah

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,840
lots of room for discussion here and i'm

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,360
um another question are you

00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,240
interpolating over the settlement data

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,840
or signing

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,840
pixel 2 area have you tried

00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:01,200
interpolation

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,919
um so with this one again um i think

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,320
uh we haven't tried it out yet um what

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,919
we're

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,399
doing is more we haven't tried input

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,039
interpolation yet um what we're doing is

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,799
more of a

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,080
i guess like a pixel to area sort of

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,480
thing um

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,120
we don't have like a one-to-one

00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,880
correspondence for

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,519
the buildings and um

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,480
the settlement layers so we're just

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,200
assuming that

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,760
if a settlement player pixel is there

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,919
there could be one or more building

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,600
um no interpolation yet

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,880
okay um yeah an interesting question

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,799
is um about um

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,760
how do we use your uh um

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,279
your products um or meaning with the

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,880
results for the philippines

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,799
what are your current recommendations

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,120
for the local osm community

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,120
in terms of focus in mapping areas

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:03,440
um so i think it's really

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,480
it's really like two things right so you

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,200
you want to create what we've found that

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,960
useful is you want to create something

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,760
that's easily understandable for

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,560
everyone

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,079
so the output that we created with the

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,839
data completeness

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,280
we could just publish it and like

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,679
release the data

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,760
but i think what was helpful in making

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,000
the volunteers also

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,679
be able to use it is to have a web map

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,240
so that's really the

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,159
the goal um to make it usable for

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,760
everyone and if the web map

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,119
if you have a web app it's going to be

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,480
more usable because it's going to be

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,119
more understandable

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,079
and they can find where the areas are

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,879
incomplete and

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,879
what's not um yeah

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,639
okay um we still have some time so

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,919
um maybe one more question at least

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,000
um well maybe maybe it would be

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,800
difficult for you to answer that if you

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,200
didn't

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,359
uh um watch the specific talk but uh

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,599
uh how do you evaluate frederick

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,560
statement on volunteer versus paid

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,680
mapping

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,760
even you've seen the talk yesterday uh

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,119
with sponsor stopping constantly

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,320
consequently

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,200
the mechanics of stuffs uh by gore

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,760
station

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,960
so if you can comment on the issue of

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,920
paid mapping

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,920
if we already discussed corporate data

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,200
yeah so i think i yeah so i did

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,880
watch um i think

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,640
right now i'm still trying to form my

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,520
own opinions about it

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,440
but i do think that it's important to

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,880
sort of build the community and just

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,359
make sure that there's room for

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,200
everyone um i think that there is room

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,160
for like volunteer mappers there's also

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,839
room for

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,400
paid mappers um yeah so i don't know i

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,040
do

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,760
know that if like there is like if like

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,480
um

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,760
the sponsorships like the funding uh

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,640
stops then the

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,400
the the paid mappers the paid mappers

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,720
won't be able to

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,760
map that much anymore so i think that's

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,640
that's something that

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,520
you also have to consider right um so i

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,839
really think that

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,960
it's just it has to be a conversation in

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,960
the community

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,119
and how do you like how do you uh

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,280
like how do you try to make sure that

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:29,680
both sides can work together to

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,680
improve the map improve the database

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,079
okay thank you for a very sincere

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,320
response answer um i'll add one last

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,240
question of my own um

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,079
i found your results for the philippines

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,480
very interesting because

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,720
there's a lot of rich literature about

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,280
the digital divide in open street map

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,640
data

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,680
and how urban areas are mapped more than

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,160
rural areas and

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,440
high income areas are more than low

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,320
income areas

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,000
and the results from the philippines if

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,599
i understood them correctly showed that

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
this is not the case

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,920
at least in the philippines so do you

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,079
have an idea why is that

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,359
in the philippines uh you were

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,400
discussing about

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,960
the basically go through city by city

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,960
but

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,079
do you have any evidence for that and

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,839
and did you see

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,839
something similar for madagascar

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,440
yeah so i think i can only speak to the

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,839
situation in the philippines

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,800
um since we've been discussing mostly

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,400
with the

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,480
um hot osm team in the philippines um

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,680
based on my understanding the way that

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,920
they map is

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,760
they coordinate with like certain

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,920
agencies in the government

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,520
and they focus on these priority

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,520
provinces first

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,920
so i think they focused on one province

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,680
like in the northern part of luzon and

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,599
then now they're focusing on another one

00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,079
in the southern part of luzon

00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,640
um so i think that's the reason why

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,400
it's not necessarily that the or the

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,119
rural areas are unmapped

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,400
so there are some provinces that are

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,640
very rural but

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,400
because they're the ones that are chosen

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,839
to be the priority

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:20,560
that's where a lot of people map um

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,359
so yeah i think uh so can you repeat the

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,240
second

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,680
part of the question uh i think you

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,800
covered that uh the second part was

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,160
about

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,119
instead you can mainly explain that the

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,320
philippines

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,680
context um yeah so i think it was an

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,720
interesting question and the

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,720
answer that raises um the role of

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,920
organized activity in openstreetmap and

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,780
how that relates to

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:49,859
the known uh biases

00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,859
[Music]

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,400
um yeah i think we'll uh

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,680
finish with that i think we covered

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,560
almost all the questions

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,240
not all of them um i want to thank you

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,920
again for an interesting talk

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,240
i think there were quite a few

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,760
interesting questions afterwards and

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,240
lively discussion and invite everyone

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,280
watching or listening to join us for the

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,920
third talk in

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,359
five minutes about also about data

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,480
quality but this time

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,640
using uh user-centric uh or

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,400
increasing quality measures so thank you

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,839
again audi
