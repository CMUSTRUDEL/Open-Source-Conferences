The number of OSM contributors every year tends to increase. But not all are sustainable contributors. For example in Indonesia, there is a lot of OSM training and Mapathon but it is suspected that there are not many local contributors of all time. For this reason, extracting information from OSM accounts that have been registered since a few years ago that classified as a rare mapper. The method is by recording the top 500 accounts in Indonesia, identifying local accounts based on profiles and heatmaps, sending questionnaires, and summarizing them. The results can be used by the Indonesian OSM community to increase the sustainability of the contribution of local people in OSM.

In many developing countries, the number of OSM contributors tends to increase every year. But the amount of increase has not been directly proportional to the sustainability of contributions to OSM. Indonesia is an interesting example of developing countries with many OSM agendas from various parties (Grab, HOTOSM, RedCross, IFRC, OSM Indonesia, National Disaster Agency, etc.) including training and Mapathon. In general, OSM was introduced in Indonesia by HOT OSM since 2012. Until 8 years later there were not many local mappers who contributed sustainably. It is also interesting to explore as a basis for increasing sustainable contributions to OSM by local mappers or mappers who have a certain area of ​​interest.

Tools from Pascal Neis help to identify the top 500 newest mappers in Indonesia. As well as the user profile page and heatmap to identify the background mapper and their interest areas. After being selected the "local" accounts are then grouped based on their activity level. Then send structured messages through all their OSM accounts.

The results of the interviews are then grouped based on the activity of contributing and the age of the account. Then the statistics are determined based on the diversity of answers. The results of this interview are expected to be useful for all stakeholders who directly and indirectly deal with OSM. Concrete steps for an awareness-raising strategy contribute to OSM on an ongoing basis in every OSM event held.

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,570
M deep facts in a developing country

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,210
an Indonesian case study so what is the

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,579
impact of people's programs in countries

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,280
and what does that mean for local

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,079
mappers and social shows share some

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,879
research and it looks like she's used

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:48,300
Pascal nieces that tools which is

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:51,329
fantastic to see how data-driven yeah I

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,800
mean in addition to that she's going to

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,719
be talking a little bit more about the

interviews that they did with the data

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,410
that they found out so who are the top

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,210
mappers in Indonesia and then what are

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,340
their experiences in terms of behavior

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,619
change and how does that how do people

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,810

really glad to convene this conversation

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,909
with you for state of the map

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,880
hello everyone greetings from Indonesia

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,119
I hope everyone is in good condition and

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,770

can get back to our normal activities

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,829
and of course it's an honor for me to be

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,360
able to join in this step of the math 23

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,850
me I am funny

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,520
from humanitarian OpenStreetMap team

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,460
Indonesia I will present to you my

00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,149
topics about OS m defects in developing

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:07,320
country Indonesia case study so let's

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:09,660
get started the number of OS and

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,150
contributors tends to increase every

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,680
year you can see from the statistic

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,159
papers colonies

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,530
improvement but unfortunately the graph

00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,040
does not get the exact number of total

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,019
contributors in Indonesia they grab only

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,099
shows and increase the number of

00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:32,219
contributors osm was introduced by hot

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,319
osm since 2012 until eight years later

00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,959
there were not many local papers who

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,359
contribute sustainably even though many

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,409
OS an agonist front of various parties

00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:46,590
such as creb hot osm red cross horns

00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:50,480
indonesia national disaster again see

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,310
etc including training and my putin the

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,260
train in developing countries tends to

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,079
be less fallen sorry my purse then paid

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,030
members why even though there are more

00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:02,939
and more new OS and accounts in

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,700
indonesia christians who are the

00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:10,829
contributors halt and why did they

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:15,930
contribute to indonesia generosity as a

00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:18,090
center of activities in indonesia other

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,620
big cities also may have many members

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:25,010
but not as much as jakarta based on

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,900
overview of OpenStreetMap contributors

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:31,379
bypass communist there are six different

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,229
types of mappers number one in register

00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:37,470
at least one change set is done

00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:42,299
number two Enrique ring less than change

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,169
set number t jr less than a hundred

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,199
changes

00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:48,720
number four senor less than 500 change

00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:54,060
here number five sent here for us

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:58,859
resident 2000 change set number sick go

00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:01,259
with more than 2000 changeup sin from

00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,509
this picture almost all my parallel fall

00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:06,180
access in jakarta in the surrounding

00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:08,549
areas when we check the list of all the

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,709
types it can be seen in the picture

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,069
there aren't very many my parts level

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:18,419
but if we need to see the active mapper

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:21,659
on me and contribute a lot employees m

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:25,050
we can unselect all the types

00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:27,419
living world and it looks very different

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,810
which is only for content

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:32,999
third of the result at first I assumed

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:36,930
that the member who mapping in the

00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:41,159
capital city of Indonesia was active and

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:45,810
sustained but apparently very few so I

00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:48,110
was so curious welcome my first

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,729
condition in Indonesia like other

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,460
developing countries there are still

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:56,699
more paid mappers then floor leaders

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,909
from the region of 500 top male parts in

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,460
Indonesia two months active then looking

00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:04,830
at the contributors member profile it

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,680
can be seen in the percent percentage

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:12,479
diagram of who are the contributors in

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:16,669
Indonesia as much as forty four point

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,289
four eight percent paid member mentioned

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:23,539
organization they are working related to

00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:26,279
OSF as much as thirty three percent

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:28,919
voluntary map are not mentioned any

00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,870
organization on their profile usually

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:35,339
mention about their mapping interest or

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:38,159
activity related to SM as much as twenty

00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:40,349
two point six percent unknown no

00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:42,689
information provided on their profile

00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:47,159
and usually their mapping area user

00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:50,339
across contingent or hit run type so

00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:53,550
after eight years later in Indonesia who

00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:57,529
have contribute to mapping in OSM how

00:05:53,550 --> 00:06:00,659
and why did they contribute in Indonesia

00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:03,509
to find out who has contribute to

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:07,319
mapping in OSM the first thing I do is

00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:10,379
preparing question area I prepare a list

00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,020
of useful equations to find out who are

00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:16,050
the contributors how and why did they

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,389
contribute to Indonesia the next one I'm

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,539
looking for the data contributor from

00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:24,659
past colonies through 500 toppe my parts

00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:27,180
in Indonesia and from overview of

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:31,770
OpenStreetMap contributors in Indonesia

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:36,269
and mr. Pascal is happy to help provide

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,639
data to me directly the next by sending

00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:41,250

decipher all for him and the last one is

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,150
collecting data in Excel by processing

00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,730
the target and search by contributors

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:06,120
who fill in the teasers post-christian

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:09,210
Airy step one is the survey manual which

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,790
results from a sample of 500 top

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,740
Indonesia members who were active in the

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,010
last two months and the data from

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,580
overview of OpenStreetMap contributors

00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:24,480
eye contact users via message on user

working profile but the mapping

00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:33,450
Indonesia I asked their help via inbox

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,880
to fill occasionally fortunately some of

00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,700
them reach me back and step two is

automatic survey by distributing survey

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,590
column to several osm community groups

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,700
such as OpenStreetMap indonesia

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:49,380
community youth member community

user profile was distributing survey

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:17,010
columns to several OS and community

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:22,410

message by fill in the survey to know

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,390
more about their motivation and the

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,110
mapping strategies as after I send

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,350
message to

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:36,570
OSM pokken contributors here are their

00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:39,570
response from 43 consommateurs who are

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,930
delay paper background is usually

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,870
related to their big contribution level

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:49,020
for example hiking or cycling offer

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:53,490
usually continue to contribute the there

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,660
GPX or at voi as long as they doing

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,810
their hobby

00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:00,300
students and freelancer are categorized

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:03,210
as Florence I remember because dating

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,960
explain later show they are not getting

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:09,030
paid for any contributions to OSM

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:12,150
government worker and non-government

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:14,550
worker are categorized as paid maple

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:17,580
because they met in osm the

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:23,100
consideration of word is done a cover a

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:26,250
day five days in a week where they get

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,940
to know a SM based on the result offered

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:32,310
the office or fecundity contributors get

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,510
information about OS and according to

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:39,270
their background as much as forty forty

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,520
three point two percent of the largest

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,310
source of information obtained by

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,220
contributors drop book bursting on the

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,440
internet yet accountant by self

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,690
searching because their hobby social

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,840
media such as Twitter Facebook or

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:57,360
Instagram so at this point in I can say

00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,120
did the information provided while

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,490
communities itself helpful to make

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,150
anyone get ready for their first

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:10,320
constitution to I am in the best way as

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,990
much as twenty seven percent no osm

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,510
through daily into institution where

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,460
they work in collaboration to get

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:21,660
training from hot oil and Indonesia

00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:25,290
group Indonesia and us-led it is

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:28,260
indicate it is indicate that OS m

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:32,100
reaches wider cross organization level

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:35,490
or the noise contribution also exist in

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:38,220
Indonesia from this activity from the

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:44,310
University ratio by hot OS and Indonesia

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:46,890
grayling 1809 percents of respondent and

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:50,130
the rest of the respondent as much as

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:53,580
ten point eight percent obtain

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:57,530
information about OS m from the open

00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,530
source community day in fault

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:05,500
what their motivation was on the result

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:08,440
of the survey injuries from the

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,010
contributors their motivation to use is

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,610
M number one is the easiest with large

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:18,790
amount of data can be contributed making

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:21,310
it easy to input data together easy to

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,710
understand and data that has been

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,600
contributed will be available to the

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,550
public

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,250
attractive apparence complete data many

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,760
filters available can be accessed and

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:37,450
utilized by only one and then can help

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,960
others so silversmiths for humanitarian

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:44,410
it can take and give special info about

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,860
an area as additional comparison

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,250
literature and use of satellite on map

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:54,970
expert which usually use Google Earth

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:59,410
global members and SAS planet job

00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:02,560
demands for house for house or building

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:05,850
and wrote data gets for volume team

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,380
often use it to map and designed

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:13,200
transportation network in a city or

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,200
region and the last one is their hobbies

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:21,580
when they are mapping in OS m the number

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:25,120
one is when there was a disaster in

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:28,090
Indonesia the next when work and project

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,210
needs the next one when have a lot of

00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:34,270
free time the next one when special data

00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,220
in OS m is missing or wrong and the last

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:42,280
one is when there is a change in

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:45,010
satellite imagery from 42 respondents

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:49,810
who answered that the best experience

00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:54,690
when using OS M I categories with three

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:58,750
best best experience the number one is

00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:01,560
soft pleasure and satisfaction when the

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:04,750
contribution is available on many device

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,840
number two is OS m as jobs demands

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,760
become a hobby it is from the demands of

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,920
rock college to become a hobby

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,430
number three is all

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,010
not only mapping platform but also

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:20,680
socializing toast it means that RSM is

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:25,500
not only technical but can discuss each

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,500
other if there is an incorrect input

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:31,839
when I arranged this research I had

00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:34,690
several expectation that could be done

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,949
but the reality what happened while

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:41,589
doing it was not as I predicted the

00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:44,310
number one is valid statistical data is

00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:47,199
hard to come at the beginning of his

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:49,420
researching for new data is very

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,750
difficult to find statistic for the long

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,000
term such as the number of registered

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:59,529
account contributor in Indonesia each

00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,380
year from 20 2012 to the prison or that

00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:06,430
number and username active account

00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:08,620
contributor in Indonesia thankfully mr.

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:12,639
Paz colonies wants to help at least give

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:16,600
me advice and provide the data this felt

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:21,160
that a statistical is hard to come for

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:24,370
me because I am NOT a IT people the

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,550
number two is it it's hard to contact

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:30,820
contributors when I'm contact the

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:38,110
contributors it's really easy because I

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:40,990
can contact them via direct message but

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:44,410
the challenge is getting their response

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:49,180
in a short time maybe because it is

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:50,380
their only active in a certain time they

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,260
raise their time

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:56,199
number three is not many active

00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:59,949
volunteer contributors were found many

00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:04,029
is relative is relative in the Indonesia

00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:06,670
terms it could actually that in

00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:10,300
Indonesia there were many volunteers

00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:15,220
just because of inequality in

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:19,690
infrastructure like example not having a

00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:23,589
laptop cell phone GPS internet site now

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:25,460
what access is too difficult to be route

00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,760
only penetrated

00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:31,220
so not our volunteers are managed to be

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,860
nos and contributors for now

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,200
it could be heated in the past there

00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,290
were people who had been trained it or

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:42,440
knew LSM but the difficulty of

00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:45,170
continuing contribution was because they

00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,020
didn't have the equipment for example

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,600
people in the remote areas of de

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,990
montagne understand how to input but

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,980
they have nothing cut me free time to

00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:01,640
contribute Qian can be exchanged with

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,620
time to find the food because there are

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,790
still many whose lives are less

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:11,209
prosperous in Indonesia even those who

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:15,470
are active and have access seems to have

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:18,740
finished completing the big city number

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:21,980
4 is their motivation and experience as

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,560
cost constraint contributors unique per

00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,110
individual the combination of

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,709
respondents motivation and experience

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,310
with them also degree affects the level

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:36,050
of their contribution for example

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,630
experienced people and their motivation

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:46,370
because job demands are certainly more

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:49,490
active in their contribution that brings

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:53,990
us to the end of my presentation in

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:58,070
brief the defect in OSM in the Indonesia

00:16:53,990 --> 00:17:01,730
our local paper is a pleasure seeker to

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:04,069
read in the small amount currently from

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,520
respondents answers which in reality

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:09,620
they make honest em in their spare time

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,010
spare time means it does not expect

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:16,689
every weekend or every specific time so

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:20,300
not those that are active continuously

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:23,240
number 2 Indonesia are is tactical

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:26,510
actively mapping by forest mappers now

00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,210
and then it turns out that there are a

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,640
lot of contributors who participate in

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:35,809
mapping in Indonesia whether it's paid

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,960
mapper or volunteer mapper number 3

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:41,870
money many organizations

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,520
Firmin or not in indonesia recognizing

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:49,520
osm to fulfill their need this is from

00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,679
the answer job demands all rectoress

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,549
assignment linking coins and with their

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,399
work because in indonesia make one map

00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:01,880
policy is still ongoing so many

00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:06,890
stakeholder needs to find as many as

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:09,380
many map but firm resources as possible

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:14,330
to meet the needs related to special

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:17,210
data one of SM alternatives I thought

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,640
from the respondents answer why they

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:23,330
were looking for alternative Maps even

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,510
though there are maps many maps apart

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:33,980
from from the government from other

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:36,980
companies okay that's all from me thank

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,620
you for listening my presentation I hope

00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:43,100
what I have shared will be beneficial

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:54,940
for all of us thank you very much and

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:54,940
goodbye b21 right thank you so much

00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:02,510
visitation I have some questions here

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:04,820
from the community one wants to know

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:09,220
what do you think motivates people to

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,220
continue as contributors annoys them I

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:20,779
think many members who want to

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:27,880
contribute to us mr Fraser I think like

00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:34,299
work projects or college college for

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,299
their homework I think maybe the praiser

00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:42,080
okay alright thank you another word

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:47,090
person is asking about if you've

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:49,730
included genuine use in your service and

00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:52,419
how many are female mappers and how many

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,419
I'm your mappers

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,300
unfortunately when I'm doing this

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,540
research when I am doing the cushion

00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:12,470
airy I don't looking for their gender

00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:18,050
female or male so I don't get did that

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:20,060
time okay you want any information about

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,970
the platforms that they use mostly when

00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:25,480
they are mapping for example use them i

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:31,180
deter or the mobile application they use

00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:35,660
yeah actually yeah I am asking when what

00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:39,880
day that they asking they want to know

00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,880
the applications or the platforms that

00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:49,940
when when doing this questionnaire I'm

00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:54,370
not asking what the platform what ya

00:20:49,940 --> 00:21:01,780
performed a u.s. that I'm asking about

00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:09,260
the mapping of use shattered imagery or

00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:13,790
from internet or sulphide in the sofa in

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:23,150
the area that what I sank a not the pot

00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:25,940
from their use so they also want to know

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:28,700
do you have over time data analysis as

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:32,180
well for example if someone started in

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,010
osm via grab hot do they stay

00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:39,280
contributing after they leave one of

00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:43,300
those projects no no I don't have a data

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:46,970
time the other time data analysis for

00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:50,840
people who are they contributing and Lee

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:54,410
if I don't have that data I think

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,150
someone is saying that it's because it

00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:03,080
would be very good for your next ten

00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:06,770
years and if it is included yes okay

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,420
another person to know

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,460
that it would be good for it right up a

00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,650
methodology others might be able to

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,770
analyze the community health and growth

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:19,260
in their countries so if you write one I

00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:22,440
think I think it would be something but

00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,870
the communities can use so that they can

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,800
use it in their communities do you find

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,700
okay writing Indonesian yeah yeah I am

00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:34,170
good

00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:38,580
maybe I can use some dairy - what yes

00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:45,540
right this metallurgy on Horace I'm

00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:47,610
diary okay ready this is Heather Dewey I

00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:52,080
just want to say thanks again and height

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:54,380
Trudy I think the methodology itself I

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,300
think it's a really important example

00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,490
and I think that there are some examples

00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,810
in OpenStreetMap already that Martin D

00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:06,600
just I put this in the comments but

00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:08,340
Martin do to City City do you think

00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:13,290
figure out how to do that at a country

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:15,860
level and it can help a lot this morning

00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:18,360
[Music]

00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,870
really late at night so I would view

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,440
myself

00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:25,680
the idea being able to measure community

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,870
health what you've shown is they're kind

00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,630
of portions of how they contributed and

00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,040
all I think is happening is is that

00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,750
there's some work that we can build on

00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,540
it so I'm really thankful that you're

00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,920
gonna make an OS on diary because I

00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,260
think the methodology and the fact that

00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,470
Pascal helped you in terms of being

00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,600
supportive is is great there's a whole

00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:48,150
global community around how do we put

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,340
metrics against community engagement and

00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:52,680
I think you you've tapped into something

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,480
that's really that start back to true

00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:59,850
day but just congratulations on the work

00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:07,070
treaty okay thank you comments and a

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:07,070
compliment for me I hope you can give a

00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:20,060
have a beneficial for our sign community

00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:20,060
of course and help live basic in there

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:30,640
my parsing Indonesia wonderful truly yes

00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:33,580
there's another question there's another

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,130
question what do you think is the impact

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:42,870
of the one map policy in the work of

00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:47,260
wisdom in the Indonesia yeah I'm doing

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:52,020
yeah when I'm doing this this question

00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:58,330
Ari I got some respondents answer a day

00:24:52,020 --> 00:25:06,570
mappers mapping in osm they need another

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:13,780
platform for their for their mapping and

00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:18,550
so I think maybe it's a link to one map

00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:19,210
policy in Indonesia because it's still

00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:23,620
going

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:27,160
I think do you answer link from playing

00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:37,360
with that project in Indonesia I think

00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:39,940
that so yeah so some people giving in

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:44,560
comments I don't know if you have you

00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:47,560
have comments when a telegram so that's

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,390
tweet one mom I mean he had seen

00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:53,500
anything going to the Grammy I guess I

00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:57,670
had some people go ahead treaty okay

00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:59,800
yeah so he that is saying that it is

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,820
really great to live stative and

00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,770
qualitative analysis using osm tools and

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,740
connecting community I think what you're

00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:11,740
doing is really great I saw me I guess I

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,870
just had one comment to make that if all

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,960
communities would do this I think it you

00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:21,130
also drop us to like to assess our

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:24,910
growth in a more in a more sustainable

00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:28,990
and a sustainable way I think all

00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:31,180
communities should is you know and I do

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,590
I do agree with Trudy that they're more

00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,590
metrics and understanding

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:40,360
we have of communities do your research

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:42,640
is is is important so again I can't that

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,580
commute the local chapters and community

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,539
working group in their talk last night

00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,510
they're going to have a community

00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:51,970
Congress and so I think maybe what we

00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:54,070
can do is recommend that the methodology

00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,320
that we have a conversation around the

00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,179
work that you've done and then consider

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,940
before that Congress happens in November

00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:02,710
that maybe they a few more countries use

00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,990
the same methodology or build on it

00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,029
because then we would be able to assess

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,010
the community health in different places

00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:12,250
and so that would be Indonesia teaching

00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:14,919
the rest of us for it so just a thought

00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:17,260
for you I will send the link to you

00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,190
later I know that we might have a few

00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,140
more minutes I'm just gonna check with

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,360
Kyle who's one of our amazing tech team

00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,740
and I just want to say one more time can

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,419
we just give a thanks to the tech team

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,779
for keeping us going because we have

00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:30,760
Indonesia Zambia and Switzerland and

00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:32,080
Kyle's in South Africa and we're all

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,240
here together on this journey

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,159
Kyle how much more time do we have good

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,919
another ten minutes ten minutes

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,020
wonderful so DUII if you could do this

00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:42,520
project more what would you do to

00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,169
enhance it like so now that you've done

00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:53,590
this first stage what would you do for

00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:56,830
the next stage yeah I when I have more

00:27:53,590 --> 00:28:04,179
time we can collect more personnel and

00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:16,330
get more get more answer that can help

00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:20,020
us too just to help us get a more yeah

00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:24,309
that's what I mean so what you would

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:26,529
like is more data right yeah maybe more

00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:28,809
time to analyze it now with the

00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:31,659
interviews octa contributors she sent a

00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:35,289
note to them in the OSM system right did

00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:39,490
you talk to anybody in person oh no no

00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:43,960
I'm just a send them or when we set that

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:46,570
link to questionnaire survey and then me

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:50,800
or some of them or

00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:54,460
reply - edge and I'm just thank thanks

00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:58,960
for their help to me yes like that

00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:03,460
I don't seem them or in my in persona I

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,560
hope I can write I've been doing them in

00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,830
my job I've been doing online interviews

00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,900
and so maybe like we're doing right now

00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,450
it'd be interesting if you did a couple

00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,760
of small groups like this because

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,470
sometimes people I have found and I

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,330
interview I work for the Red Cross Red

00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,040
Crescent so I work with people around

00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,980
the world and everybody has different

00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,600
styles sometimes when we talk to them

00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,420
online they're more comfortable than

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,860
something to email you get more data and

00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,620
and I know it takes a little bit more

00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,120
effort but yeah and then for our data

00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,440
nerds I'm sure that that's more

00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,240
complicated because you don't

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,910
necessarily want you just want the facts

00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,370
ma'am and so it's complicated for sure

00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,530
so if you had more data would you do

00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:47,440
this into other portions of because I

00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,690
know that Indonesia is quite large is it

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,460
is it that you had majority of people

00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,720
from Jakarta region or you had it from

00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,450
all the little islands - there's

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,040
thousands of islands so you got it was

00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,140
it was spread across the country I just

00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:02,140
just remind me a bit more about the

00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:08,110
spread of of it of the sample that you

00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:14,050
had when I'm looking for there or as a

00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:19,060
user profile and then I am seeing offer

00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:21,670
free OpenStreetMap there there are on

00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:28,000
Europa and the surrounding area and some

00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:37,980
of them in the other cities are not mix

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,980
it is like in the of different Allen

00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:49,170
Trudy is your sound not working Trudy

00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:52,510
has a question for you Trudy go ahead

00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:55,500
yeah I also wanted to find out do you do

00:30:52,510 --> 00:31:02,290
this with other people in your community

00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:06,280
specifically you do it alone I'm doing

00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:10,990
this alone which helps with my seniors

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:15,460
and work just like that not a community

00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:20,410
and not a large people just some people

00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:22,450
on my work workplace and another

00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,340
question which I had what are you like

00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,140
that you wouldn't how are you going to

00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:30,490
use them to see to it that your

00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:35,020
community grows more than the way it is

00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:38,559
currently excuse me how are you between

00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:48,220
a great results for to cause an impact

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:50,549
in your community if I understand

00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,080
correctly Trudy you're asking about

00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:55,559
growing the act of the study is that

00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,559
correct

00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,890
no like how you should wait to use the

00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,250
results just gotten so that she can

00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:05,530
integrate them but in the book of

00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:07,360
policies that Shirley now try to use to

00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:14,200
see that the community grows up I'm

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:16,240
clear and understandable so Dewey does

00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,160
the research inform your next steps in

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,049
the community so does that mean that

00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,880
you'll make some changes so that how

00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:35,169
does it have what will you how what will

00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:36,669
you do with this analysis next you said

00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:38,500
that you wanted to do another stage of

00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:45,790
analysis right so I think that's

00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:49,260
probably your next step right yes okay

00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,260
like a nice thing

00:32:49,460 --> 00:33:07,130
maybe for example like when I sorry I

00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:09,780
don't get what the Christian I'm sorry I

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,480
think we were just wanting to understand

00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,040
more about your next steps like so now

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,510
that you've done this and you said that

00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,230
you would like more data and more

00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:20,760
analysis and I think that's exciting and

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,590
so I look forward to seeing it and then

00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,570
you said you would write a diary about

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,570
your methodology which is also exciting

00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,320
wonderful so do you have any other

00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:37,470
comments or suggestions for other people

00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:39,480
who are researching yes yes yes do you

00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:41,490
have any do you have any suggestions for

00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:50,070
other people who are doing research like

00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:54,390
this for the work that you for question

00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:57,750
are I think for strategy for the mapping

00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:12,200
and the long lasting contributor that's

00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:15,480
what I want the next step yes right now

00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:17,220
wonderful I think I think we have all

00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,740
the questions that we've gotten today in

00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,600
the hack Pat sorry in the pad there's

00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,730
lots of questions and comments there for

00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,710
you do we I just want to say thank you

00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,780
so much and Trudy it looks pretty good

00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:30,620
thank you

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:34,560
congratulations on your work and they're

00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:37,370
wonderful think it's legislation you
