Trufi Association NGO offers an open-source journey planner app for formal and informal transport, based on public transport mapped in OpenStreetMap. In this extended talk, I would like to explain, how the participants can be customize the app to their own city, region, and country.

With Trufi, mappers and developers can customize an open-source journey planner app for their own city, region or country. Especially in emergent countries in Africa, Middle and South America and Southeast Asia, where informal traffic (no stops, undocumented routes) is mainly in use. 
For the public transport data part, OSM is used to map the routes, OSM2GTFS or our own tools are used to create GTFS, which is hosted in OTP. Besides the obvious tasks (map routes, customize app code), many more important steps need to be done: Get a team together, find develop perfect UX for your city, release, finance the server and map costs, do marketing, convince governments to collaborate, approach users, run analysis on data, improve OpenStreetMap routes, offer solutions for drivers, etc.  
I would like to talk about these necessary steps, with stories from our implementations in Bolivia, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Colombia. 
Finally, I would like to discuss in an extended Q&A part whether OpenStreetMap is made for 100s of (bus) routes - we had fruitful discussions with pros and cons on that in the talk-de mailing list in July 2019 that we could continue.

welcome back

00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:14,900
everybody welcome back this is the first

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,720
talk of the second section of the day of

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,000
truck 1 we are going to have these first

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,759
talk that is taken by Christoph answer

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,380
in the toll career among you to you that

00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:27,290
the every time you have you have

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,829
questioned UPS or any comment about the

00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,840
torque goes immediately on on the pad go

00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:35,660
check try and make your question on the

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,760
pad not way to the hand of the of the

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,489
meat of the roller but when you have the

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,829
the question wrote it in the pad so that

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,300
the talk will be taken by increased of

00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:47,809
answer that is the president and

00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,659
co-founder of the NGO Trophy Association

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:53,030
and the talk will focus on the use of

00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:54,920
one of them of application that develop

00:00:53,030 --> 00:01:03,859
that is called to through Fiat in

00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:06,110
emerging countries this date of the map

00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:09,260
participants my name is Christophe Anza

00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm from the trophy Association

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,110
international NGO working with public

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,130
transport and I'm very happy that I can

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:22,670
show you within our session that with

00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:26,840
the help of OpenStreetMap how you can

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:32,030
publish a multi-modal journey app for

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:35,530
the public transport in your city we've

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:38,060
created this app for inform a transport

00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:40,760
informal transport means no official

00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:44,120
stops no schedules bus lines are not

00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,690
documented agencies run the bus lines

00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,880
and I would say it's and the majority of

00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:53,150
the world public transport looks like

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,190
this looks informal or maybe see me

00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,440
formal which is like a mixture where you

00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:02,780
have maybe former transport such as a

00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:06,020
mate role our official bus lines mixed

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,599
with informal transit where I live in

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,019
Germany that's public transport very

00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:14,450
formalized but I also used to live in

00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:17,180
Bolivia where you have where trophies

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:21,170
that you can see on the screen are

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,910
mainly running on the streets and in

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,470
most of the cities of

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,280
the world especially in middle and South

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:32,810
America Africa eastern Asia

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:36,110
public transport is informal why why is

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:39,020
it important to have yeah digital

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:42,770
solutions for this kind of transport it

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:45,320
is because also people in the in

00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,210
countries with public this kind of

00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,430
public transport mostly in development

00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,650
countries they also want door-to-door

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,630
journey planners they want to have more

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,770
reliability per than the public

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,840
transport because and cities also want

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,000
this because public transport protects

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,380
the environment because less people buy

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,240
their own cars use individual transport

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,640
so it's really good to make public

00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,580
transport stronger and it becomes more

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,810
attractive if you have if you can if you

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:21,230
know better which route to take when the

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:24,260
next bus is coming what the rates are

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,950
for for a trip like all these kind of

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:32,360
things that mobility as a service can

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:34,430
bring as trophy organization our main

00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,820
product is the trophy app it's open

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,580
source

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:41,209
it works white label which means that

00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:44,510
you can easily or not easily met but you

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:50,840
can bring it to your own country you can

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:53,300
localize it so each app is different or

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,450
is working with a different City but

00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:00,310
they all fork out of true power trophy

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:03,920
app it's multi model which means that

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:06,530
it's also working so that you have draw

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,400
2-door navigation and you have all other

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,320
means of transport and it's a journey

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,270
planner which says how you get from A to

00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:22,250
B Cotham sauce released under a GPL

00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:24,620
license on github and has different

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:28,880
features the red bottoms

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:31,250
is the full dotted ah navigation the GPS

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,860
location so that it easily shows you

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,500
where you are right now such as multiple

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,919
routes

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,020
it also suggests street names crossings

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,729
points of interest that's very

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,789
interesting for informal transport

00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:48,639
because we figured out that most people

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:50,860
look for crossings or intersections so

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:56,949
they would look I want to go to the

00:04:50,860 --> 00:05:00,550
place where the Rowena's is crossing the

00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:02,500
ayah cut wrap the ayah culture Street so

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,469
people because there are no official

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,199
stops so they navigate to intersections

00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:09,400
and this is something we've built into

00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,909
the app that you can search for

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,659
crossings you can save preferred routes

00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:19,690
and other typical features that you know

00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:21,069
from journey planners the yellow points

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,669
on the right side they have rather

00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:30,490
technical so it's boots on flutter so

00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:33,610
that it's directly usable on Apple and

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,710
on all Android phones it works also with

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,349
older phones which was very important

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,479
for us because we our solution is mainly

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:42,819
working in development countries and

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,250
routes can come from OpenStreetMap

00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:47,469
obviously also from other providers but

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,289
OpenStreetMap is our preferred thing

00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:52,379
because it's open data you can add your

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:56,710
own language just like Quechua in

00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:59,860
Bolivia or Amharic in Ethiopia so that

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:03,789
people can easily use it and actually

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:07,150
feel broadly use it on our development

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:10,629
we go along the digital principles if

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:13,240
you know them to make this really

00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:19,870
sustainable and helpful in the long run

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:23,229
our team is global but we really rely on

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,680
local communities this is a picture from

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:31,319
our annual meeting that we had last week

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:35,400
but people from several continents and

00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:38,139
we are experts on transport on

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,199
development or like developers software

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:44,860
development community managers marketing

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,169
people and we are all working

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,430
voluntarily right now actually one of

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,520
the goals that we have

00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,380
gather it good funding so that also some

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,270
people can pay it and work a bit more

00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:00,580
reliable on the project and this is the

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,979
global team but we also really need

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,650
local communities because the best

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:08,050
public transport app is nothing without

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,509
really good local data our local bus

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,590
routes and on this screen you can see

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:17,550
from accept Leonardo from Dewey Tama

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:22,090
loose and somewhere from Cochabamba

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:25,570
DeWitt originally from Addis Abeba and

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:32,560
other people from there are from

00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:34,510
communities and and really helped us so

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,130
it's really a mixture we are global we

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,880
have global team but also local

00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,919
communities

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,550
what is trophy Association it's a

00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:45,490
non-profit startup for informal public

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,789
transport non profit means we are

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,620
registered NGO wretches in Germany most

00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:51,340
members and Germany in South America

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:59,110
right now

00:07:51,340 --> 00:08:01,150
throwing in Asia and Africa and we've

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,449
started the project in May two thousand

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:06,520
eighteen and after I go live in Bolivia

00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:09,070
first we saw that this kind of app is

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,400
useful for many other countries as well

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:16,210
so we founded the NGO in every 2019 wine

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,479
NGO we actually all did this for fun and

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,460
to do something good

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:26,590
so we said best thing is if we go

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:29,590
open-source use open data and just help

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,800
communities worldwide to to adopt and

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,570
localize the app in their countries

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,050
that's why we then basically started the

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,779
NGO to have a legal organization for

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,820
doing something good our mission as NGOs

00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:45,250
to improve public transport worldwide

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,580
through digitization and the vision is

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:54,040
that people in development countries

00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:56,950
would have the same positive usefulness

00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,129
of public transport like they have and

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:03,889
for example my country Germany

00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:06,429
so that they would know when is the next

00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:08,989
bus coming what's now the best option

00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:12,679
and that public transport gets

00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:18,079
attractive and people really like to use

00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:20,259
it the impact is that we build

00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,699
OpenStreetMap communities train them

00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,949
that we make the data publicly available

00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:26,989
on OpenStreetMap so maybe that's a good

00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:30,889
moment to open OpenStreetMap for your

00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:34,100
city and just check transport layer if

00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:39,739
you have if you have a good information

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:41,839
on bus routes then we publish the app to

00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:44,600
find good door-to-door connections and

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,239
then we have cities finally for the

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,329
information from the searches we can for

00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:51,529
example easily tell them when the app is

00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:54,589
yeah

00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:57,170
giving bad results so if I move from one

00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:59,480
part of the city to another when do I

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,929
have a bad connection so where would a

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:06,139
new bus line makes sense or where maybe

00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:09,049
are too many punchlines working on the

00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,790
same in the same area so this is

00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:15,410
something where we really want to help

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:19,189
cities products in the beginning we had

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,170
the trophy ax as our main product it's

00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:23,990
still the main product but we added some

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,879
more products what is the driver for the

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,220
Travis that I will show in a second

00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,379
also dashboard for cities in the agency

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:34,749
so that they know where the buses are at

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:39,740
the moment tools for transit data that

00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:43,129
translate OpenStreetMap to GTFS or that

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:46,699
check all OpenStreetMap bus lines if

00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:49,819
they have errors or if they if they are

00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:54,829
working well and we have a documentation

00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:57,619
on how to do route mappings because it's

00:10:54,829 --> 00:11:00,290
not an easy thing yes

00:10:57,619 --> 00:11:02,239
on the server side we are implementing

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,850
trophy app Forks we are helping as well

00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:08,419
to bring it to cities like lifted Juarez

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,819
Aviva Arc Rodri Chama and will training

00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:12,679
local teams we are maintaining bus

00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:14,189
routes and OpenStreetMap so we're not

00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,970
only doing the initial

00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:21,269
arm off of putting them to open screen

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:26,369
we also have maintenance maintain them

00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:31,769
this is done with ground truth data sort

00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:34,799
of people can enable tracking if they

00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:38,309
say line is missing or it's wrong and we

00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:41,009
collect these GPS snippets that we get

00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:44,899
and if we have enough GPS snippets for

00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:48,660
line we use this data and adapt

00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:50,939
OpenStreetMap bus lines we are another

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,720
services a data platform for a better

00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:57,329
public transport planning for cities you

00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,059
use the drive app where traffic

00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:02,399
interests am going this route now the

00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,959
tribe is sharing GPS coordinates in that

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,199
moment so that we know where the buses

00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:10,410
are we can tell the user when the next

00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:13,290
bus is coming so the driver has an

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,179
incentive to maybe an incentive of

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:18,689
winning more passengers because

00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:21,809
passengers know where he is and he can

00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:23,669
also indicate or she when the bus is

00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:26,970
full this was especially important

00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:28,949
during social distancing time because of

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,629
kovat so we said okay

00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,179
we want to know where the full buses are

00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:35,939
because we can calculate them how full

00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:38,489
is public transport in a city right now

00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:40,970
the network how full is it or how full

00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:45,869
is a line so that the user can design

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:47,910
decide if if if she/he wants to use now

00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:53,999
public transport are rather wait for two

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:55,559
hours when less people on the bus we had

00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:57,959
a wonderful trophy app hackathon to

00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,989
create these features against kovat 19

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:03,959
and the video can should tell it much

00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:06,139
better than I could so I want to show

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,139
that

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,950
trophy is a multi-modal journey planner

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:19,040
for semi-formal public transport in big

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,590
cities it is scalable to any world city

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,600
even where there are overlapping

00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,430
decentralized transport networks the app

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,850
can be localized for the language of the

00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:50,090
users in Ethiopia is called ena goozle

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:52,520
which means my trip 35 volunteers in 10

00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:54,920
countries and 7 time zones held a

00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:58,250
hackathon to kick off an ambitious

00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,290
project to turn the open-source 2 feet

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,050
journey planner app into a social

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,730
distancing tool for public transport the

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,430
contributors are software developers

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,870
designers and experts in international

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,060
development now I'm actually the

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,220
coordinator of the trapper after a team

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,490
I'm working today with a facebook board

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:20,930
for the trophy up I'm Sandra one of your

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:22,940
new UX designer bus drivers will have an

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:27,860
app to report the occupancy of their

00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:30,110
vehicles in real-time with a current

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,090
situation we took into consideration is

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,030
social distancing therefore we are some

00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:39,100
features where a driver can say if the

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:39,100
bus is actually full or it's empty

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,970
commuters planning a trips can see this

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,160
real-time information in the truth we

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:51,710
have and plan the best combination of

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,780
routes to minimize exposure the Ethiopia

00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,370
Ministry of Transport is interested in

00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,340
these features as soon as they can be

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,070
launched especially in this time the

00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,710
problem that we face is that you know we

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,320
don't have a kind of system that tends

00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:09,170
to the people not which bus come at this

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,650
time and also we don't have a kind of

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:15,440
passionate payment system in cities like

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,270
Harris Ababa Ethiopia the trophy

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,170
capabilities will represent a leap

00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,880
forward

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:24,280
one thing that we're learning from the

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,210
covert situation is that you really need

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:30,100
digital transit data during these times

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,200
especially when you're trying to

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,880
communicate to the mass and the public

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,880
about any changes that are happening

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:43,780
when we go to you know a chance to have

00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:46,930
this trophy application we can make

00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:49,030
easily the transport planning public

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,190
transport or atomization and also you

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,290
know accessibility analysis and

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,020
development of innovative application

00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:58,510
could be you know easily accessible and

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,140
good for us the results of the trophy

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,130
app hackathon were a proof of concept

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,680
municipalities around the world want

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,690
these features for their citizens the

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,030
social distancing features of the trophy

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:23,230
app can make public transport safer

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:25,960
anywhere in the world yeah thanks for

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,900
watching the video I hope you understood

00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,660
a bit more of trophy and where we work

00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:35,200
with it was actually very cool to talk

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:37,810
with transport authorities in Accra and

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,120
as Aviva and anna-marie war about what

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:43,480
they do against Cove it and how our app

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,380
could help and we really hope to win a

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,740
funding now to make the real apps out of

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,930
the proof of concepts good so trophy

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,100
apps are right now in Bolivia Colombia

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:58,630
Ghana at chipiya

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,550
they all look slightly different have

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,230
different languages different colors

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,140
different name they are their own

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:09,180
entities or you separately download them

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,180
in an Apple Store on Google store and

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:17,980
that you could be the fifth and that

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:22,270
also means um there are people that have

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:24,550
already done it so you can also ask them

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:28,960
how they did it and obviously we can

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:31,559
have you as an NGO s1 so we expanded to

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,799
these four cities and we have pilot

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,870
released in La Paz and Manila and we are

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,980
discussing with some other cities right

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:43,259
now if the app should go there

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:48,029
I think Kampala is missing I hope

00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:49,950
someone from compilers is watching and

00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:52,230
beside that it's Antonella he would as

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:56,340
alumni will be in Managua hey there

00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:59,580
about Kathmandu and yes we are ready to

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,639
expand trophy to much more cities trophy

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,799
made news also locally we were very

00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:10,529
happy when the Ministry of Transport

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:14,039
announced in the gusu app in on

00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:17,309
television and we were very happy the

00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:20,240
summer had a front-end development to be

00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:23,159
on newspapers and television in Bolivia

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,369
so what we basically really saw is that

00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,379
people are very free very proud that

00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:30,809
they have a public transport app in the

00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:33,360
city because it's modern one person

00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:37,139
wrote on plain water refuge I feel like

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:41,639
in US or Europe when I use the app which

00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:49,019
was somehow amazing because yes he just

00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:53,610
felt the digital benefit off of the app

00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:55,049
so how can you bring trophy up to my

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,619
city and actually that's the central

00:18:55,049 --> 00:19:01,889
point of my of what I wanted to say in

00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:04,409
the session but I felt like I had to

00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:06,899
explain and in the beginning what it is

00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:10,019
what it all is about so you have to

00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:12,869
start collecting bus lines and

00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:17,519
digitizing them to OpenStreetMap so I

00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:20,909
asked around where we're already and yet

00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:23,429
i'm timetables and routes exist and then

00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:27,330
you have to create a GTFS with our tool

00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:29,909
set or with osm to GTFS which is another

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:34,440
wonderful project that does the same

00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:36,869
thing more or less you have to provide

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,169
our OTP server to make door-to-door

00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:43,440
route planning's then you also can test

00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:45,120
it of course there it's possible to make

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,950
many errors on the way

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,760
so first you would test in this website

00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:53,520
if the trip lending works well and then

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:58,309
you can also customize then you can take

00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:01,590
trophy call from github and customize it

00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:03,930
to your city and use your own open trip

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:09,120
planner of course there's much more to

00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:12,590
do so you can you should get in contact

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,150
with us so that we can help you

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,800
you should put together local team

00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,610
because so many different skills are

00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:24,330
needed from marketing project management

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:27,360
development etc and you should also look

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:31,490
for specific features that are important

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,890
in your city like the example that we

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,450
enable navigation to intersections maybe

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,280
there's something totally different in

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:42,600
your city that needs to be done so that

00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,600
users really feel it's useful also you

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,610
should look for user experience you have

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:51,270
user interface what's what's best which

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:53,340
language to add and how to finance

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:57,480
server and map costs you should do

00:20:53,340 --> 00:21:00,380
marketing well release the app talk to

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,910
government authorities run analysis and

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:05,580
in the end you can also help to maintain

00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:07,650
the OpenStreetMap roads I think what's

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:13,140
really essential to do was on the slide

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:15,679
before that's like the very basics but I

00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:21,120
think that the steps on this slide

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:23,910
really make sense if it's if you want to

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,150
make it really something with a big

00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:29,400
benefit for you city last but not least

00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:33,030
you have to know the technology stack so

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,440
OpenStreetMap is the basis the streets

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:40,710
the crossings the points of interests

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:43,800
but also the bus routes we have our

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:48,210
tooling to create GTFS and to check the

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:51,260
OSM OpenStreetMap lines then the GTFS

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:54,570
needs to be created and needs to be

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:57,179
published to open trip planner to do the

00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:00,019
journey planning on the top there's the

00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,879
flutter app the user interface

00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:04,820
that needs to call these different

00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:07,789
things main part of the app is obviously

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:10,279
the map itself of the app is the map

00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:15,619
you're working on so then you need to

00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:22,009
use a map Tyla of map tile server to

00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:25,099
provide the apps the maps we'd be happy

00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,869
if you if you are interested and if you

00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:29,479
could join us we're looking forward and

00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:32,929
hearing experts worldwide that work on

00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:36,259
topics on all the topics you can imagine

00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:39,710
maybe now we look for funding

00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:44,839
organizations so that we can pay

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:48,619
specific tasks in the NGO but also in

00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:52,159
the in the local communities to make the

00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:54,009
app as useful as possible we look for

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,139
cities that need mobility as a service

00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:59,179
solutions and are interested in trophy

00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:03,309
we're looking for local communities that

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:05,749
want to bring trophy into their city

00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:09,859
thank you very much for listening I'm

00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:16,309
looking forward to your questions and I

00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:18,529
hope you enjoyed it thanks thanks thank

00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:20,659
you very much Christophe for your talk

00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:23,419
for your very interesting presentation

00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:25,820
of this application we have a lot of

00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:29,059
question that you are going to to answer

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,309
we have also in this Q&A where is also

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:33,379
the present of someone that we saw so in

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:37,309
the video that is one of the head

00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:39,919
developer of the soft application so we

00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:42,289
start with some question we have oh I

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,269
saw that also in the pod the one of you

00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:46,669
your member of the trophy Association

00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:48,499
start to reply I stopped it because we

00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:51,049
we have a lot of time to reply to all

00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:52,669
the quest letter appears so we have time

00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:55,039
if you know if you don't know that is

00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:57,950
also a possibility to to datura directly

00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,710
a reply from saurons so the first

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:02,509
question is about GTFS that i saw that

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,289
at the end that you spoke about it maybe

00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:07,849
the question was done before so they say

00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:10,729
general transit feeds specification

00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:12,529
standard demand boosts top do you work

00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:13,419
with the standards how do you manage it

00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:15,129
is

00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,870
if you want there is also just the reply

00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:18,220
if you don't know the reply to be just

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,940
there is written also they reply in the

00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:25,990
pod so I should maybe just read out and

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:29,139
so we use open standards everywhere our

00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:33,700
our APIs open source all we do is open

00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:36,539
data as well so we use GTFS and actually

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:40,059
it's run on open trip planner to make

00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:42,519
results and we used in the beginning we

00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:45,340
just created virtual stops on all

00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,619
intersections like I say in the

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,559
presentation there are no off no real

00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:52,929
stops in the cities so we created

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,990
virtual stops on all intersections so

00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:58,090
that you could just navigate there and

00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:02,169
then one city I think it's Addis Abeba

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:04,539
Yin Augusto based on trophy is already

00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,999
having GTFS flex and we want to use this

00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:10,210
also for the others because it's exactly

00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:12,759
made for informal transit so that people

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,559
can everywhere like that people just

00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:16,450
know in this kind of trends but I can

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:21,789
just say hey I want to stop here I want

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:23,679
to enter here so yes we on that so there

00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:26,799
is also a similar question that I cry if

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,960
you are using flex gtfs flex and you

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:34,899
just replied the rain they are so easy

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,759
yes yeah Sam correct yeah that's ok yeah

00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:38,799
ok

00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:42,009
I brought someone with me he's one of

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:46,419
the founders with him trophy app would

00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:48,070
not exist he had been joining trophy at

00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,649
from the beginning he wrote his own

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:53,470
journey planner three years ago in

00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:56,619
Cochabamba Bolivia together with friends

00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:58,629
he joined our team he became part of the

00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:00,940
OpenStreetMap community and that's also

00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:03,639
the perfect example how we a trophy

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:07,659
wanna work with communities so we have

00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:09,879
we are we have a technology provider but

00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:11,710
we really need local communities like

00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:15,369
some whaling haja bomber with his team

00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:17,139
and in other cities that yeah that's

00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:19,330
collect the data bring it to

00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:21,600
OpenStreetMap and and think about the

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:24,250
really cool features that the app needs

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,440
so I brought him with me so in case I

00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:30,400
have technical questions often Street

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,310
yeah map question sequin answer okay

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,560
perfect so we got directed to the second

00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:38,350
question is also more general that is

00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:41,230
you in your neutral cues talk about

00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:44,200
digital principals in particular you see

00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,570
that you are developing Iraq following

00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,480
these digital principals are someone

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:51,940
could link to website to digital princes

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,950
that organ is that the day there is the

00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:58,540
idea of little princess that you would

00:26:53,950 --> 00:27:00,310
like to follow yeah exactly so the

00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:03,340
digital principals are very interesting

00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:07,000
it's made for developed for for

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:10,780
development so to have sustainable apps

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,700
that work in the long run and the

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,010
principles are that you decide with the

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,680
user and that's exactly what we do with

00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,660
the so we we really started in

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,900
Cochabamba asking the passengers how

00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,670
they how the VF has to be so we really

00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,710
designed to the users and that's what we

00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:30,210
want to do in all the cities when it's

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:33,130
understanding the existing ecosystem

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:35,590
what we do because we really collaborate

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,600
with people we cast with the app so it's

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,730
a white label app so each city has a

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,400
different app actually a copy of the app

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:45,400
or a fork so that it's really suitable

00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,680
for the people that use it not only

00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,740
colors but also language and maybe

00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,510
additional features then a principal is

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,760
designed for scale and that's obvious

00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:57,040
because we our app is white label so it

00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,620
can scale out its point for

00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:03,130
sustainability it's data Trevon we use

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:06,340
open standards it's it's for reuse and

00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:10,270
improve address privacy so we wouldn't

00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:12,970
track a user or like we couldn't track

00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,920
down to this specific user or something

00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,980
and these are like the digital

00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:22,990
principles that also we say we we

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:25,090
support them okay perfect so we have a

00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,640
question that also was reply at the end

00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,290
but I know that the people that make the

00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,210
question is really interesting the reply

00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,650
and can also help you the question is

00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,300
which are the country in which you are

00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,040
in Africa is working the application

00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,260
that was partially replied that Erica

00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,240
and I India and in part to her there was

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,070
a question about Tanzania

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,720
if there is something that is developed

00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,700
and the question was I don't know if you

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,690
know there is this project crow to map

00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,550
Tanzania it is lead part of one of the

00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,260
leader is Janet shuttin and it is very

00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:56,470
it's a very big project and very

00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,540
wonderful project and maybe this is the

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,430
other question was making connect to

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,590
disease which is the level of technical

00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:05,200
expertise that is needed to develop er -

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:09,760
- - for the whole the process mm-hmm

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,450
good so we and Ghana and at this oh we

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:16,630
are Accra with trot row app and with

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:19,900
Vienna gusu app in addis abeba we are

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:22,150
not in Tanzania yet or not in any other

00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:25,270
African city so we are talking about

00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:27,010
some communities so whoever has asked

00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:29,670
the question is very welcome to approach

00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:33,580
us because I think they are very good

00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:37,540
mapping projects out there where trophy

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:40,240
could be a puzzle piece in in in their

00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,130
project so not only collecting data but

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,180
also having a journey plan in the end

00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:48,490
that could be distributed that could be

00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,520
published so from the technical

00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:53,380
expertise that you would need the most

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,380
obvious is the user interface which is

00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:59,020
written in flutter the Google technology

00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,480
which makes cross-platform or which is

00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:06,490
cross-platform development for iPhones

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:08,200
and for Androids and and then also you

00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:11,050
have to know like backend technology

00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:15,520
open trip planner you have to be

00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:19,390
familiar with GTFS but the good thing is

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:22,180
we have open source tools from osm -

00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,770
GTFS actually that's a very good one

00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:27,790
that I mentioned the presentation it's

00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:30,430
called oz oz m2 GTFS but we have our own

00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:34,150
one which is a bit special and like

00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:36,580
customized for for trophy app so we have

00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:40,530
tools for that and of course we can help

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:43,570
on the whole journey okay thank you

00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:47,500
someone have I forgotten any technology

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:50,680
that would be very useful no I think

00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,740
that that's all you need for for create

00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:57,289
your own

00:30:51,740 --> 00:31:00,440
fork of trophy okay okay so we have us

00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:03,289
coming back to the to the GTFS the

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,960
request is a question about out the the

00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:07,909
bus roads are created offended the

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,100
question say you create the GTFS from

00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:12,710
OSN routes do you create a route

00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:15,980
manually with chiasma how this process

00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:21,200
could work that's a good question for

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:23,390
you somewhat okay so we create the okay

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,399
we are start collecting the routes from

00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:31,789
everywhere from the users from the

00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:33,919
government documentation from from from

00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:37,250
some books on from especially from the

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:41,390
agencies so then we collect it and then

00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:43,970
use and other tools like Google my maps

00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:47,779
for Virginia for for generate the the

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:52,970
path and and then we use a JSON for for

00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:56,360
for put all routes inside to or same for

00:31:52,970 --> 00:32:00,730
just so we have some some extra tools

00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:05,149
because not all juicers are expert using

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:09,649
JSON so we create the own extra tools

00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:11,960
for facilitated so like some some

00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:14,149
presets that that's what we need

00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:20,020
especially on their own on the map in

00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:24,950
then that's all what we use for for

00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:27,169
adding roots on the OSM so basically the

00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,929
process is collecting the data using an

00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:33,350
other extra tool for generated path then

00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:38,539
use this part to to put the data into

00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:40,549
the Daoism by the way there's a certain

00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,799
a colleague of us will have a

00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:46,190
presentation in around four and a half

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,250
hours eight o'clock UTC on how to

00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:51,380
documents bus lines on opens in

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:57,730
OpenStreetMap so that it can be used by

00:32:51,380 --> 00:33:00,620
trophy or other tools okay perfect so

00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,340
whether some question that are all

00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,950
related

00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,110
so we're there's a question that is why

00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,330
there is the

00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,250
that they did you propose the idea that

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,480
the Apple is not there is not one unique

00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,070
application but there are moved

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,410
appropriation that are the fork off

00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:18,640
station say an original one a starting

00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:20,440
one why there is this this idea and do I

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,559
have to download a separate application

00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,260
for every city or I can use one

00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:28,540
everywhere and a question related to

00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,360
this this application are available on

00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:34,840
asteroid that is platform for for

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,870
Android the loading of application mm-hm

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:41,980
so yes we have a separate app in each

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:45,429
city because we believe that each city

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:48,030
has a different user use apps

00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:53,410
differently they need different features

00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:55,960
so they need their own app so that's

00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:58,240
definitely the case so you would have to

00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,020
install the different apps but of course

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,570
let's say if we have if we if we if if

00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:07,270
different cities for example to eat Hama

00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:09,399
in Colombia as an example the two other

00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:11,560
cities in the same region want to have

00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:14,800
yep as well so then the whole region

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,800
could also have an app together which

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,139
may allows them to hop between cities or

00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,240
use the same city when it wherever they

00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:24,040
travel so trophy app could work in a

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,639
city or in a region or even in a whole

00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,639
country

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,109
actually we thought about trophy world

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,230
so then you could just like navigate

00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:35,169
everywhere but the basic idea is really

00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:38,230
like having a unique app customized for

00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:42,609
a specific community for a specific kind

00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:45,669
of user and it's not running yet on F

00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:47,470
droid every I I got this question

00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:51,070
already some time and I remember there

00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:52,929
was some challenges but I don't remember

00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:55,859
what the challenge is where but maybe

00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:58,900
it's only something someone has to do

00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:01,420
thank you very much we have five safe

00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,550
few minutes remaining for the lot of

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,490
question that are remaining that'll mean

00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:09,430
a demeaning so I suggest you after to

00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,619
you ask oh so you put I don't I don't

00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:13,780
see the end of the talk but if you punta

00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:16,030
referent where people can ask to you how

00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,910
to reach you since there are many some

00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,559
other community like chrome

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,079
zhenia interests in the application

00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,270
there is some way that they can link to

00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,440
you there is I don't know something that

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,900
they can point to you

00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,609
and after I will just make one of the

00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,369
last question that is few question

00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:35,349
remaining I saw that there is a knock I

00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:37,119
think that also is from trophy that is

00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:39,130
the reclining to some question that I

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,980
suggest you also after the finish of a

00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:44,470
polka to go and to check the remaining

00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:46,960
question to make multiple replies

00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:48,039
there is just one fun question that is a

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,530
the word

00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:53,109
trophy is something meaning meaningful

00:35:50,530 --> 00:36:03,010
there is some it depends on something or

00:35:53,109 --> 00:36:07,299
is a general word as some way sorry that

00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:13,660
trophy what does trophy means trophy

00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:16,119
means basically a hole takes place the

00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:20,109
groove immunise trophy yeah I don't

00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:26,529
because that but that's locally words

00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:29,500
that's basically it in Spanish which is

00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:33,960
called a trunk tray transported a route

00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:37,000
efika that's that's basically a static

00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:40,809
transport something like that but that's

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:44,410
locally from my CV especially on my

00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:46,270
country it's a specific world of exactly

00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:49,180
so that's how the mini passes are called

00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:51,700
trophies so therefore it's true trow a

00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:55,510
pin in Accra because the buses are

00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:58,329
called throat rows and so it's jeepney

00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:01,839
AB in Manila that we are planning dolla

00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:04,059
dolla app in Tanzania Matata app in

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,049
Kenya so we really think about like

00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:10,359
using the local language I think yeah

00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:13,779
change the name according to where we

00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:15,910
are going to exactly exactly just our

00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:18,670
association had to pick one name and we

00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,230
said who live yes the start so we call

00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,910
ourself trophy okay

00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,260
just the last question because I found

00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,690
very interesting and after we had

00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,549
finished our time there is some issue

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,720
when there is not internet connectivity

00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:33,039
in some place where the bus has to go

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,440
sorry laughs there are some issue

00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,670
related to the Internet connectivity is

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,650
something that is required by the

00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,109
application just few words because we

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:44,260
have less time we like offline mode that

00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:46,319
it works offline yeah there is yes

00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,089
something rather there is some aspect

00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:51,789
yeah that's a big challenge we really

00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:54,819
tried from the beginning but it was very

00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:56,650
difficult to to get this done we would

00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:59,170
have to implement our own search

00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:03,130
algorithm to the app actually Samuel has

00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:05,740
done this with his own app so it's it's

00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:08,079
on the feature list for later I really

00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,520
liked all the questions very interesting

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,559
gonna answer then in the panel and

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,930
please write me an email so it's very

00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:16,089
easy just just search for a trophy

00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:19,660
Association you find contact please

00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:22,089
write me and don't forget in four and a

00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:24,640
half hours Aron is talking about how bus

00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:27,339
routes can be added to OpenStreetMap so

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,829
that trophy words thank you very much

00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:31,779
Christophe and Sam one very interesting

00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:33,369
tool click there was a lot of

00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:35,289
interesting question because the talk

00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:39,069
was very interesting a very interesting

00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:42,940
project so thanks to all and remind it's

00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:47,109
