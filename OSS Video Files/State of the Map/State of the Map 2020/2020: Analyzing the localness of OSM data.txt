The “localness” of data is often described as a major factor for the authenticity of (geo-) information in OpenStreetMap. However, the exact meaning and relevance of “localness” remain controversial. We compare proposals made for the “measurement”, i.e. for the empirical operationalization, of “localness”. Based on this, two convincing operationalizations were selected and implemented in order to contrast regional differences in “localness”. Our analysis allows the identification of regions in which exceptionally high proportions of data are mapped remotely – mostly regions in the Global South. Bearing this in mind, we discuss how “localness” is negotiated in the OSM community.

A frequently reproduced mantra of the debate on Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) can be summarized by the term ”localness”: It emphasizes the actual or at least desired local production of geographical information. Through new tools in Web 2.0 it is assumed that now a large number of “ordinary” people “on the ground” can generate knowledge about their everyday environment. This postulated “local expertise” operates as a claim to truth of VGI. In contrast to “conventional” geodata, whose truth claim is more likely to be based on professional and technical expertise, VGI is often legitimized by its authenticity due to its “localness” (Goodchild 2007, 220 or Elwood et al. 2012, 584).

In fact, relatively little is known about how “local” VGI data actually are. Although “localness” is accepted as a central quality feature of VGI (Barron et al. 2014), it is hardly taken into account in approaches to measuring the quality of VGI (Senaratne et al. 2016, 161). However, we compare existing methods for measuring “localness”, with particular emphasis on the different geographical scales on which they work. Additonally, considering that the importance of “localness” is controversially discussed in the OSM community, further research is conducted in OSM wikis, blogs, group chats, at conferences and with interviews. The key interest is to explore the significance and relevance of “localness”, and simultaneously investigate the implications of an interference of local mappers with remote mappers.

The presented research follows a mixed methods approach. Firstly, a synopsis of all methods that have been already used to measure “localness” is implemented. The effort to determine where OSM users have their origin is necessary because this information is not saved within the OSM user data or cannot be read simply from IP addresses (Quinn 2016, 6). In addition, the methods aim to find out where the density of local information is high. Many of the used methods work best at a regional scale, only some function for global data. Since we are most interested in the latter, we have implemented two methods that are possible on a global scale. Using the first OSM changeset of a user, we determine the density of local mappers across the world (Neis 2013). Furthermore, the sum of all used OSM keys or the sum of the different OSM keys in an area per number of OSM elements can be used to identify areas with a higher density of local content. Zielstra et al. (2014, 1227f) have already used this method on a regional level for selected mappers; with Zipf et al. (2019) we are able to calculate this on a global scale.

The second part of the study consists of qualitative interviews and analysis of documents such as OSM wikis, blog pages and group chats. After a preliminary research, the aim is to dive into exemplary local communities in which conflicts between local and non-local mappers become evident. For instance, the contested meaning of localness for humanitarian mapping between local map guards and international aid organisations will be further investigated. In addition, the emerging issue of the relationship between maps produced with the aid of “artificial intelligence” and local mapping communities will be explored.

Frequently, “localness” is considered an important indicator for the authenticity of data in OSM. The research carried out should therefore answer the question whether locally produced data in OSM are “better” than data not produced locally. Moreover, we also approach conflicts between local and external mappers by examining debates and discussions within the OSM community. This research thus helps to gain a better understanding of the conflicts that exist within OSM and between different user groups within the OSM community.

hello my name is Susanna Shweta bag and

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:16,370
today I'm talking about analyzing

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,370
localness of course M data at first I

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:23,580
will show you my overview of my

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,460
presentation I will talk about what

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,869
localness is and which methods have

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,420
already been applied to measure

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,719
localness after this I am contrasting

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,329
two methods and further I will show you

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,750
some prospects for more research and

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,420
then I will come to my conclusion let me

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,270
start with the general embedding of osm

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,940
with the web 2.0 a new hope was

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,640
connected that new civil society

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,340
projects such as OSM will open up the

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,670
production of geographical knowledge

00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,710
before web 2.0 the production of

00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,359
geographical knowledge was dominated by

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,730
governmental organizations such as

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,280
military photography and surveying

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,640
offices or universities and a few

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,250
specialized private sector companies it

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,439
is assumed that now many ordinary people

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,189
on the ground can generate knowledge

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,070
about the everyday environment through

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,759
new tools in web 2.0 this is called

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:28,049
volunteer geographic information or vgi

00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:32,070
it is assumed that now everyone can join

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:34,200
in but osm is still dominated by certain

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,900
groups and their world views mostly

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,270
highly educated people from the global

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:44,570
north which are male and have a high

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:48,780
affinity to technology and start to map

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:51,720
already good chilled argued in 2007 in

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,590
his march cited vgi founding text as

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,320
follows

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,020
thus the most important value of VG I

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,670
may lie in what it can tell about local

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,460
activities in various geographic

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,159
locations that go under unnoticed by the

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,009
world's media and about life at a local

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,459
level also other early scholars follow

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,780
this argument this is M I read unit

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,510
gradually rich

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,650
we reproduce mantra of the debate on

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:22,910
merchant geographic information and can

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:27,630
be summarized by the term local illness

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:29,370
this record it emphasis the actual or at

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,500
least the desired local production of

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,390
geographical information but in fact

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,959
relatively little is known about how

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,940
local the data actually are last but not

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,040
least there is a lack of deeper

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,920
reflection of localness and closer

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,739
examination localness is first of all

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,209
only an attribution that is brought to

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:53,670
VDI from the academic debate the local

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:57,300
expertise operates as a claim to truth

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,850
of PGI in contrast to conventional cue

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,010
data whose truth claim is more likely to

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,069
be based on professional and technical

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,410
expertise UGI is often Likud legitimized

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:10,319
by its authenticity due to its poor

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,390
localness although localness is accepted

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,030
as a central quality feature of eg I M

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,880
it is hardly taken into account for its

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,070
evaluation on the main list and in the

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,260
forum questions of localness and

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,900
remoteness were discussed frequently and

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,480
also sometimes controversially for

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,420
example in the context of data imports

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,820
our automated mapping tools the use of

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,739
satellite images the mapping in the

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,650
global South or with reference to the

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,350
humanitarian USM team for this a

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,780
reflected examination of the term or a

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,870
systematic empirical study of its

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,780
significance what we GI communities has

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,820
not yet been carried out our key

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,040
interest is therefore to further

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,670
investigate the significance and

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,910
relevance of the localness we follow a

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,400
mixed method approach with a qualitative

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,980
side which I will talk about later in

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,019
the outlook we want to make a critical

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,480
reflection of the local news term and

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,329
where the focus on the quantitative side

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,229
and we want to look at the empirical

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:21,470
comparison of brokenness in OSM this is

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:24,599
based on data analysis on of both M data

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,340
we started with an synopsis of our

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,670
methods that have been already used to

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,700
measure

00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,770
localness the examination of the already

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,600
implemented methods suggests that there

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,300
are structural differences in the

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,460
evaluation of the local material on the

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,190
one hand the approaches pursue the goal

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,190
of determining the geographic origin of

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:48,090
or the home base of a OSM user this is

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:50,130
what I'm calling no local members the

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,620
methods that were used all have

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,930
different requirements and varying

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,320
efforts and the effort the author's had

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,480
different spatial scopes and scales and

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,730
often for example a national level was

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,220
used and not a global one I'd like to

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:10,350
give you now a brief overview of already

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:12,630
used methods forest edits can be

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,240
investigated out of the first node or

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,490
the first in chain said this this first

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,640
edits may indicate the location of a

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,140
awesome user I will come back later to

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,780
this approach when I'm talking about

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:29,670
contrasting two methods other approaches

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,250
focus on the activity area of a meta

00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,920
with the Delaunay triangulation nice and

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,920
tips if determined for each awesome meta

00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:45,240
the area were the maximum number of node

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:48,000
edits of a meta M or of of his or her

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,340
change that centroids more easily the

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,680
country with the most edited notes of a

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,900
mapper can be determined also the center

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,850
of mass of all the change that bounding

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,670
boxes can be continually calculated

00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:02,250
lastly Johnson at all proposed to

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:05,580
calculate the geometric median of all

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:08,010
related nodes of a user other approaches

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,200
consider for example the location of a

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,380
mapper in the region where he or she had

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,660
the most edit days also the maximum

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:20,100
number of different texts in a region

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:23,880
can be used as a locating method to form

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,370
a puzzle or also the maximum number of

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,040
local texts in a region but this needs

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,560
the specification of which text can be

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,460
considered as local and this might be

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,010
influenced by the researchers review

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:41,469
which this leads me to the examination

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:44,750
of what local content is

00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:46,879
these methods which look at local

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,240
content seek to find out where the

00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:52,520
density of local information is high

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,650
like where's a high local content there

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,259
are some approaches which focus on the

00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:00,379
OSM for history dump proper depth for

00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:02,479
example you can look at four particular

00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:06,199
keys which are considered as relevant

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,810
and they're the density of these keys is

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,780
observed another approach is to observe

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,750
the total density of texts are unique

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:18,020
keys per object we use this approach so

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:22,279
I will come back later to it when also

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,770
looked in the O's M changeset dump he

00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:27,379
focused on the use of languages in the

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:30,169
comments of the change set in the case

00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:32,270
of South America he observed the

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,279
preference of different texts per

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,319
language group and was that he could

00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,889
determine if a change set was made by a

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,770
local or remote mapa also the O's M

00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:47,419
track dump or that both M notes dump can

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:50,539
be observed the track dump only exists

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:52,789
until 2013 but still it can be an

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,710
indicator for local knowledge because

00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:57,860
the tracks are usually collected on the

00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:00,110
ground with own equipment pascai knives

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,440
also looked at the O's M notes dump and

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,690
localized the notes per country further

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,699
investigation of the local language of

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:13,009
the notes can lead to information of

00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:15,199
local knowledge at the first insight you

00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:18,139
can observe that many of these used

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,699
methods work best at regional scale and

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:22,729
only some function for a global

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:24,620
comparison and since other scholars

00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:26,689
mostly concentrate on either the

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,699
localness of members of the local nests

00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:31,819
of data we are most interested in

00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:33,680
contrasting both approaches we do so in

00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,899
implementing two methods that work on a

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,959
global scale one focusing on local

00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:42,110
mappers the first chain set and one

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,149
aiming at identifying local content the

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,329
density of text and different keys per

00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:49,790
cell on a global level with these two

00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:52,040
approaches we attempt a data-driven

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,329
operation internalization and

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,939
approximation

00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:58,220
of localness but it is important to note

00:08:55,939 --> 00:09:00,679
for us that these are just approaches

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,129
and they cannot lead to a final answer

00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,869
what localness is and how to measure it

00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:08,779
with the combination of these methods we

00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:11,540
hope to explore well whether local data

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:16,850
actually coins and coincides with a

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:18,619
distribution of local Memphis using the

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,809
rather simple method of looking at the

00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:24,019
first awesome chain set of a user and

00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:27,230
similar to nice we examine the localness

00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:29,209
of Memphis across the world we assume

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,779
that the first chain set of a mapper is

00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:35,149
near his or her origin original location

00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,999
but the interpretation of this method is

00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:40,339
also limited since since it is always

00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:42,799
possible that a new sm user first has

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:47,360
mapped remotely or away from home on a

00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:50,749
trip but so this method can only be is

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,699
there as an approximation we use the

00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:55,759
first change set instead of the first

00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:58,699
node because the first node requires the

00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:02,119
usage of the OSM full history dump which

00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:04,730
requires much more computing power but

00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:07,970
the result is not much better so we

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:11,809
choose the first chain set as I said the

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:14,899
method was used before but the focus was

00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:17,149
not on the global level and the

00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:18,739
advantage of exploring the first change

00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,919
that is that it can easily be applied

00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:25,790
for the whole globe for every mapper and

00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:29,869
not exclusively for the very active map

00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:32,749
as they reside as you can see on the map

00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:35,149
we rose the same fundamental global

00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:38,809
inequalities that are also known for

00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:41,720
from other research you can see that and

00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:43,639
that there is again original center

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,189
periphery and a global north/south

00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:49,839
divide the globe will as follows

00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:53,059
localness follows the same pattern

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,489
however this one method cannot give a

00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:58,699
lot of information whether the data that

00:10:55,489 --> 00:11:01,850
may pass edit is just plainly putting a

00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:05,899
new way or node on the map or adding

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,160
crucial information about a building

00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:10,430
onto the map

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,100
and we want to examine closer whether

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,660
the information on the map is defined by

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,660
a great amount of tech or a great

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,480
variety of different keys so as a

00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,970
working hypothesis it is assumed that

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,129
the more specified information there is

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,560
the more knowledge the mapper must have

00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:31,279
had and this knowledge is not likely to

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,589
be as accessible from afar instead it is

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,470
more likely to be associated with a

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:38,449
higher low penis

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:40,759
since it all have already applied this

00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:42,800
method on a regional level for selected

00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,740
may pass but we want to take a look at

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,259
the global level so we determined the

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,600
ratio of the sum of all used those M

00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:53,870
tags to the number of both M elements

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,480
per special unit also we looked at the

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,430
ratio of the sum of different of M text

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,430
to the number of o's M elements per

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:04,009
space unit and truly this is just

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,439
another approximation and it does not

00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:08,720
have to be that a great amount of text

00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:12,470
means that there is a lot of local

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,139
knowledge the method has not yet been

00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:18,110
calculated globally so because we are

00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:20,360
still in the progress progress mm but I

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,060
will show you some results in a few

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,610
seconds when applied for different time

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,430
periods this method can also show where

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:32,269
a high variability of the data exists

00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:34,360
and when we are done with the first

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:37,160
exploration we can also look for

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,089
coincidences of this method with the

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:44,500
analysis of the first chain sets here

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:46,550
you can see in two exemplary cases and

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,850
Nigeria on the left and Germany on the

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:52,790
right with a grid of approximately 1 100

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:56,930
square kilometers and the data for the

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:58,910
first of January 2020 here you see the

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,339
sum of the difference of M keys to the

00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,189
number of OS M elements and the darker

00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:07,339
the grids are the more different Keys

00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:09,649
projects exist you can see that Nigeria

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:11,629
is more colorful than Germany that's

00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:15,649
because there are less objects in each

00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:17,809
grid at the same time you can look at

00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:20,490
the ratio of the amount of text per

00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:22,380
object here you can put a

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,170
special intention to the border areas

00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,779
where a higher issue is noticeable due

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,390
to the tagging of borders but here a

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:33,630
more detailed examination is required in

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:36,029
total Nigeria has more areas with a

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,940
lower and higher tagging ratio and that

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:44,730
is because there are more areas with few

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:47,070
objects that brings me to my outlook for

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,800
further research in this field after

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,170
exploring localness on a global large

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,050
level and greater driven we are still

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,540
obviously doing as you see we want to

00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,899
pursue further research that critically

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,520
reflects the concept of low penis

00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:05,130
therefore we want to conduct interviews

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,190
and attend both a meetings in a concrete

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:12,060
case study and examine also some written

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:15,690
materials such as in the mailing list or

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:18,690
the O's M forum or the O's my wiki and

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:21,420
we plan to include both active user

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,730
groups and also local content as I

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,940
showed before and using this regional

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:30,959
case study the richness and viability of

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:33,180
the data can be investigated with our

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,320
further widget research we want to focus

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:39,570
on different questions that are focusing

00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,180
on the map our are also on the data and

00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,250
the produced knowledge firstly we want

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,680
to examine the relationship between

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:50,370
local and remote mappers more closely

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,339
and also to what extent the contributors

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:56,339
really are normal local people who map

00:14:53,339 --> 00:15:00,450
their everyday environment and also how

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:04,200
much the the mappers themselves

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:07,589
recognize themselves as local nests as a

00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,740
claim to authority a mark of quality or

00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:12,930
also a normative guideline important for

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,910
us is also the question if there are

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,829
conflicts between local and non-local

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:21,029
nepo may pass about Authority or truth

00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:22,920
with the focus on the data and the

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:24,690
produced knowledge we want to look at

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,880
the dividing lines between local and

00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:32,760
non-local data and also look at the

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,170
question of to what extent can a project

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,149
such as osm with the

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,310
globally uniform attribute system

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,950
represent a limitation of local

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,019
knowledge this could happen well indeed

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,899
identical attributes are used in

00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:49,950
different local and socio-cultural

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:52,800
contexts this is possible because the

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:56,639
standards are often orange and in an

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,010
European context if one takes a closer

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,380
look to the data at the object level it

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:04,199
becomes evident that the richness of the

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,480
data is variable and dynamic with my

00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:08,579
imply that the significance of the

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:14,639
produced geographical knowledge is

00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:17,519
contested in conclusion let me now sum

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,959
up my main points after demonstrating

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,360
the importance of localness in the

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,370
project of both M I showed which

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,070
attempts have already been made to

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,170
measure localness and we saw that it is

00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,630
relatively difficult to approach the

00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,550
concept globally firstly because the

00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,740
concept is not clearly defined and

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,860
secondly because there is a large amount

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:41,040
of data and wolfed in the next part I

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:44,180
showed that there that we try to

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,320
approach localness based on data driven

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,899
approaches on a global level by

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,449
combining two methods but we are still

00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:53,519
in the progress and one of them is

00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:57,240
focusing on local mappers and the other

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,279
on the richness of OSM data since the

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,760
research is not fully carried out the

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:06,000
focus was on the methods instead of the

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,910
results of the methods in the last part

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
of my presentation I indicated that our

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,130
research will continue we will use

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,189
qualitative methods to take a closer

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,740
look at the original case study or my at

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:22,949
metallic material such as those M forum

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,630
or wiki we will further explore the

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:28,730
relation between local and non-local

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:31,500
mappers and non local and local osm data

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,000
with that I will leave it for today I am

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,220
looking forward to receiving your

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,260
questions and remarks this is just a

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,660
work in progress so I'm happy for to

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,690
hear any remarks and ideas from you or

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:46,669
tips you can also contact me at my email

00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,669
address thank you for listening

00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:36,850
okay thank you everyone thank you

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:41,350
Susanna for excellent presentation and

00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:45,169
now is time for the questions and

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:47,450
answers so we now we turn our attention

00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:51,830
to the certain part of the question part

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:53,330
of the hackpad and I can see lots of

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,039
comments

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,039
Suzanne you have received a lot of

00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,070
attention and seen about 26 people in

00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:03,770
attendance and thank you everyone for

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:08,059
waiting when we started and there were

00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:14,419
some hitches with the video streaming so

00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:18,070
I'll start with the comments so someone

00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:21,200
is party to pass khones so someone says

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:23,990
for my pets who start through hot

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,330
awesome their first change maybe not

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:29,659
Luka but you could look for missing maps

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,360
or hot awesome hashtag in other tasking

00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:38,570
manager tax etc in the change set

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:40,669
comment to filter those out someone also

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,559
says I would say that a great deal of

00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:44,809
mapping in the developing world is

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,590
performed by marques who are starting to

00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:52,760
map very very ink up capital letters far

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:54,500
away from where I live and I'm a great

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,159
example and this comes from Greg rose

00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:01,070
does it's only how I started thanks for

00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,299
this comment Greg Rose I think going

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,000
through this comment will give us a

00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:06,169
contest for the discussion so I will

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,899
continue with the comments

00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:11,750
another comment says I agree if you live

00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:14,929
in a well mapped place like London we

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,820
may not see any point in adding to us

00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:19,100
and there but when you travel to a

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:23,840
relatively or mapped place you are much

00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:26,960
more likely to map another okay this one

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,710
is is typing so I'll skip that as a

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,720
local mapper I'm paranoid one one day

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,480
someone something will come along and

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,130
delete all my hard work that's

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,610
interesting that I think this person is

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,700
touching

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:42,380
vandalism okay I think this one I will

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,130
come back to this comment come in five

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,500
later because the person is composing it

00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:50,270
so we have in terms of questions I have

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:55,179
my own here and there is one question

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:58,880
here for Susana is the local tax

00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:00,559
analysis done are the the country loved

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,450
or what is the size of regions

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,450
considered this is coming from Claire

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,900
Susana

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,299
okay and thanks again also for the many

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,780
comments and I want to comment the

00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:18,260
comments a little bit also I know that I

00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:19,820
also said in the presentation that is

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,760
one method of looking at the first

00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:25,700
changeset is of course Justin I'm an

00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,970
approximation and the comment that I can

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,169
look for the hashtag missing maps or

00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,970
hashtag awesome

00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:35,120
Emma or something like this is very

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:37,429
helpful I think and I wanted to only

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,320
like I show the this method but I also

00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:42,260
show that there are other methods there

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,270
too and so I'm happy to read to hear

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,700
about the comments and what people think

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:49,940
about using the first changeset and

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:54,549
about the local tech analysis and like I

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:57,860
said in these tech analysis were not

00:21:54,549 --> 00:22:01,669
performed for the whole world until now

00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:06,650
only like other others already looked at

00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:09,640
some smaller regions like I think some

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:14,419
part of Italy and I also started to look

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:18,470
at country levels but the plan is to to

00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:23,870
do this on a global level and to look

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:26,270
also if there are different patterns in

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:30,440
between global north and global south or

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:33,860
between country side and town or in I

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,780
like to swim into the national context

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,720
but also to zoom how to look at the

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:41,510
bigger picture yeah yeah brilliant

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,990
and thank you Susanna for addressing

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,700
this question I think yeah there are no

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,100
more questions but I think we have a

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,560
maximum of about 10 minutes so we can

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,660
exhaust this I will start with

00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,150
one question I have here I actually

00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,480
agree with you that a concept of

00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,710
localness is not clearly defined and

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,270
question the fact that also this this

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:06,380
work is ongoing so you described local

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,600
as home base

00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,160
so when you say home base are you

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,530
considering the country level or

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,390
committee level or something else for

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,570
example path kinase I think someone has

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:20,000
pointed this in the comment his Pascal

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:24,530
nice work on awesome noise which you

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,870
considered local is the country level

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,210
for example so when you say local nest

00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:33,950
and say home base what are your views on

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:38,330
this you mean with home days the home of

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:40,730
the person yes so that's what I had in

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:44,450
the total I said home day so I was dream

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:47,330
that this is the home country yes so in

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,790
the home country in this sense in my

00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:52,640
mind if you say a local and in home base

00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,170
I'm assuming at this point you are you

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,640
are the country level you are talking

00:23:54,170 --> 00:24:01,280
about things are the country though I

00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,800
think the country level is first step

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,190
but it would be better to look at the

00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:12,790
and more detail in within the country if

00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:15,710
you want to look at other the Methos

00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:18,260
mapping from the town to entrance of the

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,450
countryside or are they at only the

00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,950
people from from their village map their

00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:25,160
village so that it would be also

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:28,250
interesting to not look to not only

00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:32,960
determine the location of a mapper for a

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:37,070
country but also for smaller district or

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,980
smaller and grid cell and yes but as

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:43,270
also as a in approximation the country

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:47,480
level also gives a good impression and

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:49,700
about where someone know that where my

00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,030
paths are from and where less map a map

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:56,180
from yes but also and like the comments

00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:58,970
and the question about what is local

00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:03,020
knowledge is also the question if you

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:06,410
were like being in another country for

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,420
for a longer time I don't know when does

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,429
it start to be in a local are you you're

00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:13,490
still not a local that even if you if

00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:16,550
you were there for some time but if you

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:19,220
we're never there you only do not know

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,380
less information but if you if you were

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,260
there at least forum for a trip you

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,570
you're know better about this this place

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:32,510
is someone a remote map on who only

00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:37,370
looks at the satellite imagery so

00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:38,990
probably I will link this to in the

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,150
comments for because we don't have any

00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,950
more questions so let's let's jump into

00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:49,040
discussion now using the comments and

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:51,980
what comes up so I think part in common

00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:56,990
three greg was talked about the fact

00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:59,720
that you know he was a far away and

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,760
things like that and could map somewhere

00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,490
else and he's a great example in terms

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,130
of mapping in the developing world even

00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:10,460
though he is far away from home and

00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:13,130
things like that so an attack that makes

00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:16,429
me to the the thing I'm thinking of in

00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:20,300
terms of the you know the local local

00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:23,179
nets or local mappers and remote matters

00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,820
so in one sense I think that there is a

00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:27,500
distinction in your talk I think you try

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,530
to do too you know differentiate these

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,610
two but then or not on the other hand

00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:36,890
you I get a sense that there could be

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:40,160
the same in the same group but then you

00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:44,200
you using local knowledge as a sort of a

00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:46,460
criteria for for either you know

00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,740
differentiating or bringing them

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,380
together and so I'm asking

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,960
so because on one you sent to

00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:56,900
differentiate look on remote mappers but

00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,770
on the other hand it seems that you are

00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:04,070
not so momma's have more knowledge which

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:06,500
is likely to be local knowledge do you

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,910
mean even for mode mappers with such

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,540
knowledge so for example if a remote

00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,450
mapa

00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:14,390
let's put for example Greg Rose in the

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,100
comment who is now a mote mapper and has

00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:19,370
local knowledge

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,820
and it's mapping somewhere else would

00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:25,669
you consider he Gregg as a road map now

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:30,049
a local or in New York instead of

00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:32,210
looking as a local mapper is like the

00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:34,429
distinction between the local remote

00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:38,210
mappers and also the local knowledge is

00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:40,370
I was result of and seeing which methods

00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:44,240
were already applied to measure this

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:46,280
localness but I also think if if Greg a

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,159
Singh the example is a remote map a

00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,380
mapping somewhere else and another

00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,140
analysis I'm looking for a local

00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,230
knowledge and he's mapping there like

00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:00,200
very specific local text then he would

00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:02,360
be this would be considered as local

00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,340
knowledge even if he would be considered

00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:08,690
in another and this is as a remote

00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:11,240
mapper because his first his main area

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:14,419
is somewhere else but still his this

00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,750
knowledge his produced information could

00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:21,320
be considered as local in the case and

00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:24,260
that that it is very rich or very daya

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,740
he's very up-to-date and he was

00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:31,429
information that local also could know

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,740
or would know very interesting so I will

00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:36,080
assume that in this case you have every

00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:42,289
redundancy in this case that Greg would

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:45,559
be both look and remote in your license

00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:50,090
Greg I think you have been promoted for

00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:52,850
having both status as a look remote

00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,409
mapper because of the great work you do

00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,940
so ok

00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:58,669
oh I've seen a interesting question it's

00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:01,280
also coming up we have about two or

00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:05,270
three minutes so maybe you can just keep

00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:08,059
it short one says I'm gonna my local

00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:15,980
when I'm on gas pipeline that is a

00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:17,690
corner of France I think because then I

00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:22,490
think we need more background of this

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:23,750
person isn't it yeah respect to the

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,370
local knowledge because in your case

00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,590
you're using the local knowledge as a

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,059
benchmark so whoever asked this question

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,770
we need more information about your

00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,660
local knowledge

00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:36,970
and I will determine whether your local

00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:40,570
or remote are you okay with this or yeah

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:41,560
okay okay one more one more I think you

00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,930
have another question here

00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,970
yeah it would be great to have access to

00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:48,250
data about local days are you planning

00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,230
to release either the data or your

00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:53,920
algorithms so that others can run them

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:58,930
to this from Frederick yes I also had I

00:29:53,920 --> 00:30:01,510
want to say that I used the help of the

00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,880
Highgate this is a Germany also I don't

00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:06,100
know if it's a it they also are doing a

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,160
lot of work with a street map and

00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:13,030
history analysis and I it's on github

00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:17,200
already the the code I used for the tech

00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:21,330
tech analysis but for the other analysis

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:25,180
I think yeah I can also publish or

00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:30,250
release this but when I'm releasing the

00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:32,140
and the data in a like paper I will read

00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:34,900
about it I will have I can share it with

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,550
the community and that people can see

00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,370
what I would have done what are the

00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:43,060
results and and yeah the data should be

00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:45,280
also included to this that people can

00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:47,980
know what I am and what I have done so

00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,440
this is a plenum and maybe maybe I can

00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,230
also put them on a dashboard or online

00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:56,440
that you can look at it and maybe a

00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:59,080
little bit of interactive page but like

00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,500

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:05,140
