Title: 2020: The use of OpenStreetMap within the Italian Alpine Club
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2020
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/sotm2020-3661-the-use-of-openstreetmap-within-the-italian-alpine-club



The collaboration between the Italian Alpine Club (CAI) and OpenStreetMap (OSM) officially began with the signing of an agreement between CAI and Wikimedia Italia, the Italian chapter of the OSM Foundation, in 2016.
The first activity was to define a standard to be used for CAI objects to be mapped using the wiki, and this started the mapping.
Three years after that signature much has been done with a surge in the last year also thanks to the funding of CAI through the project "CONTRACT FOR THE DATA IMPLEMENTATION SERVICE IN THE INFOMONT SYSTEM".  This financed one person to carry out different activities:
- the data entry in OSM with the procedure used and the situation region by region
- the development of software released under a FOSS license able to obtain CAI data from OSM and carry out some conversion and reporting operations
- training activities in the different sections of the CAI
During the presentation will be made a history of the activities of the CAI with OSM, the results obtained so far and the various features of the software developed.

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,210
community and the phosphor the phosphor

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,880
community in italy the talk will be

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:59,070
focus on the on the work that is done in

00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:02,430
Westham by the italian alkyne Club hi

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:06,240
everybody I'm Luca Luca I'm working at

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,670
Sun detonate von Meck instituting a trim

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,500
toe that is working on agriculture

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:19,760
environment at food and I'm going to

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:24,480
present a work that we are we are doing

00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,610
with the italian alpine club and the

00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,760
presentation is done with alpha to the

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:34,050
tie and the recipe charlie both of them

00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:40,140
are a member of the hiking path

00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:43,159
committee of chi the sadiq let's see

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:50,159
what is a cup ouple italiano is the

00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:53,390
oldest alpine club in italy they manage

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:58,799
different activities like dissemination

00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:03,780
they manage the I can part the open

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:08,970
heart and they keep clean it all the

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,929
park on the path and they protecting the

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:16,090
Alpine environment

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:22,150
they are divided the inseam in several

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:26,340
chapters around the eateries and and

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:30,670
each chapter is managing the area around

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:35,489
them so they manage to clean the part

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:39,609
and they organized event they organized

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:43,299
exiting the mountain so as I thought

00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:46,930
before the the Chi is managing the I can

00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:49,269
part all over the Italy and they have

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,519
they are thousands of kilometres

00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:58,030
probably more than hundred thousand

00:02:51,519 --> 00:03:02,290
kilometer let's see how was the story

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:06,340
between Chi and all the first activity

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:09,400
was in 2009 when a group of

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:13,019
OpenStreetMap contributors organized the

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,449
first mapping party in the mountain and

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:19,510
this activity was repeated for four or

00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:22,060
five year each summer there was a map in

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,449
part in the mountain and obviously we

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:29,709
took contact with the local chapter of

00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:35,790
chi in the area of mountain mapping

00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:39,970
party 2014 there was the first Aki map

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:45,760
done with open Sigma data and the time

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:49,629
was two and they was presented at the at

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:55,500
a chi festival and they was really

00:03:49,629 --> 00:04:01,449
interested them in 2016 that was the

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:06,340
convention between Chi and the Italian

00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:10,569
local chapter which made Italia so there

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,720
was this convention was to improve the

00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:16,479
quality and the quantity of data in

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:22,479
OpenStreetMap and to make dissemination

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:23,450
about this activity a month later there

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,000
was the first

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:32,990
version of the Chi plug-in for Jaws and

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:41,230
the day after the was created a wiki

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:46,310
page about chi where we wrote the

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:53,530
guideline to map a Kim part up not and

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:58,100
all the information needs by Chi 2018

00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:02,120
chi make a call for that implementation

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,910
in implement and this was the start of

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,340
the project that i'm going to speak to

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:15,170
speak and ascended 2018 there was a

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:20,050
special rendering for chi i can pad that

00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,050
is visible in the geo rescue mobile app

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:31,030
so let's see how is the project coyote

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:35,810
project it starting 2018 and is a

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:38,990
continual right until now it has three

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:42,620
main topic one is the data insert the

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:45,590
second one is the development of some

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,880
script and the third one is the training

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:52,570
so let's see first one so to the data

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:57,560
insert the first step was data

00:05:52,570 --> 00:06:00,920
generation because the data was

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,310
collected by several archive member

00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:08,000
around italy but they was provided in

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:12,950
different format with different accuracy

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:21,100
and so we had to work to clean the data

00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:26,800
and to have a good start point to insert

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:31,430
when the data was a woman was corrected

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:35,930
we start the data preparation for the

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,580
entry this was mainly to create a WMS

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,860
server

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:47,080
and the task manager to work with in

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:49,840
this activity and at the end there was

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,600
the data entry before data entry there

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,640
was the current connection between me

00:06:52,600 --> 00:07:01,990
and the local chapter member to see if

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,780
the data was updated and so on the same

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:09,190
connectivity was the develop of some

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:12,820
script and I created some scripts to

00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:16,660
convert the OpenStreetMap data in this

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:21,090
different format GLS format like JSON

00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:24,190
kml but also some other format like

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:28,150
documents to have a catalog of the

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:34,030
acting part we will see some results

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:36,160
later now we are in the code test so we

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:42,160
are testing the code to see that is

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:44,560
doing the work properly and in the next

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,070
month we will go in production so there

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,580
will be some cron job that are creating

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:54,540
the data every time we probably every

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,540
week or something like that

00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:03,220
the last one was the training so we

00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:05,320
organized several events to train kind

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:13,630
member to insert the tie in

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:18,910
OpenStreetMap so what we used during

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:23,680
this project one of the most important

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:26,050
tool is the wiki so this is the wiki

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,370
page about Chi where you can find all

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:37,420
the information how to insert a clean

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:42,220
pad or maintain hat there are some link

00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:44,910
to other users useful tool I'm sorry

00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:49,980
it's all in Italian but you can use some

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,980
translator to to understand something

00:08:52,649 --> 00:09:00,129
for each region or for most of the

00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:04,870
region we have a page like this with the

00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:09,600
catalog of hiking paths for for that

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:14,019
region and for each spot we save some

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:21,189
useful information like the relation ID

00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:23,949
the name the code and some status

00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:27,249
information so if it's it is complete if

00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:34,930
he need the guide post or something like

00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:38,730
that we have a documentation it's only

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:42,389
in Italian and this was done by

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:47,309
especially during his training

00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:53,160
activities and we have four level of

00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:59,379
documentation from general concept about

00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:01,360
GPS and opens him up to some really

00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:05,709
advanced at the activities that are

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:11,740
useful only for few people and not for

00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:12,240
all the member we have a dedicated main

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:23,129
list

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:26,939
it's the toolkit hey Kai it's not high

00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:30,339
traffic main list but it's beautiful for

00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:33,879
new kind member that want to insert data

00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:36,730
so they can ask and some other people

00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:40,689
that are already used they can answer to

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:42,189
that dedicated question it is mainly in

00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:45,429
Italian but if you've read something

00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:50,499
English someone will will answer you in

00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:55,990
English for of course as I told before

00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:57,009
we have a plugin for Jaws and this is

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,220
really beautiful

00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:04,430
because you have not to remember all the

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:07,820
that you can use and he give you a per

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:14,450
set of tags for each element that they

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:19,690
are beautiful for Chi member so we use

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:24,610
the task manager to make the data entry

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:29,389
the task manager was installed in

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:33,709
Wikimedia Tahlia Sadler and for each

00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:37,550
region we created a task with the

00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:40,940
dedicated WMS service and this was

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:46,880
really useful because for each area we

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:51,610
can see how is the completeness of the

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,470
data so if it is complete we can skip to

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:57,680
to add data

00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:03,110
now the Toughman manager could be really

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:05,600
useful if we are able to create a valid

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:12,620
the people that are going to validate

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:16,970
the data from the local Chi chapter this

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:20,420
could be really amazing because you

00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:24,680
don't need any kind of OpenStreetMap

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:27,680
knowledge but just to see if an area is

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,820
complete and the people from the chapter

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:37,240
are the most important person because

00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:44,029
they have the local knowledge and I

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:47,690
develop a script or more script that are

00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:51,230
useful to extract data it's a little

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:54,010
before it is able to come back data from

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:57,260
OpenStreetMap format to some GIS format

00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:01,250
but is also able to create some

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:03,500
beautiful documents like this where

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:10,069
there are all the information about the

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:13,670
path and also a small map and it is able

00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:14,540
to work on a area of a region or also

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,020
for example

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:21,470
for Chi chapter so it is able to

00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:28,010
download only the data related to that

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:32,870
chapter the development I develop also a

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:37,100
website and it used the script that I

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:40,720
spoke before to give some output so you

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:43,730
can see the path you can create the path

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,710
for you can download all the path in a

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:53,170
different format and it is also able to

00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:58,010
send some a left when some data are

00:13:53,170 --> 00:14:04,190
modified in Tokushima you can send the

00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:08,360
email or a message on telegram we are

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:13,700
now testing the website there are some

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:16,760
problem still but it should go online by

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:23,480
the end of the summer or the first mall

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:26,120
for the next four so what is the

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:31,550
situation in Italy right now we have

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:34,610
around 40,000 kilometer of data you can

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:41,750
see that in 2017 the was a relief few

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:48,680
kilometer in 2017 and 2018 the was too

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:54,140
big step and and after the there was a

00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:59,900
linear increase and the last toolbar in

00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:03,680
the right are by 14 days different only

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,080
instead one year or six one but you can

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:14,030
see that there are some small

00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:19,970
improvement every every week since

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:25,030
the regional trend most of the region

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:28,340
has some improvement from 2017 to now

00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:34,190
but there are some region that they have

00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:36,460
really few data said the most

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:40,040
problematic plural is the Val d'Aosta

00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:44,320
because his yes is a small region but is

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:49,190
completing the mountain so it is it has

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:52,100
for sure more than 25 kilometers but but

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:55,220
they are not to map it correctly or

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:58,450
according to the high cut al-qaeda and

00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:02,000
so we have to work a lot of the telogen

00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:08,720
other regions that like trentino-alto

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:12,290
Adige Emilia Romagna Toscana are close

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:17,740
to be full and they don't need they need

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:17,740
only revision when some part changed

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:27,100
what tool we can use or what is the

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:33,050
output from open steam of data to to see

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:36,290
this I can pass data in in the web or in

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:40,910
some printed map so this isn't the most

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:45,680
use it website is a way market trail the

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:50,150
I conversion and you can see the path

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:53,390
you can query it's really amazing and I

00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:58,670
know that a lot of high member is using

00:16:53,390 --> 00:17:04,000
it to see the data and to see the their

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:08,030
work on obviously map another beautiful

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,190
website is a map refuge for my point of

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:15,230
view it has a really beautiful rendering

00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:21,230
it's clear and you can easily see the

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:23,840
path this is a Italian product done by

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:27,800
web map it is Italian company working

00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:35,810
with the open seam of data it is special

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:38,510
in mountain mapping and this river from

00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:43,820
this map has to rush from the web one

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:47,410
and printed one so it is a really

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:53,170
beautiful style for my point of view

00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:59,060
this is another paper map realized for a

00:17:53,170 --> 00:18:05,030
chapter of chi and it used only open

00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:09,050
data open stream map and for the in

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:12,410
shade and contour line it used the open

00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:20,800
data provided by the region around the

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:25,150
Torah is another website providing data

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:30,560
for garment garment garment format and

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:34,940
you can find also a data for hikers

00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:40,430
where there are contour line and they

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:42,620
are highlight the action path to the

00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,480
relation in open sea

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:50,950
it is only need a lien but you can

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,950
understand or your some translators tool

00:18:51,430 --> 00:19:01,610
another well-known website is the MTB

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:04,370
and I came Maps he provide a beautiful

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:08,480
map for Garmin for all over the world

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:10,970
so you can use it and I know I know that

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:22,100
several time member use it to have them

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:24,440
data on on the Garmin for mobile you if

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:30,610
you are in Italy you can use jaw rescue

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:37,760
as I told before it has dedicated

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:40,430
rendering showing the Chi path and the

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,270
only programs with dual rescue that you

00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,470
have to pay

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:47,870
to get the application instead for kind

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,600
member it's this softly because they

00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:55,090
make a convention between the Chi and

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:58,160
the product producer of the application

00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:04,210
otherwise you can use Osmond that is

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:11,780
provide the most used web mobile app and

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:15,680
he turns a hiking rendering to and you

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:21,050
can see the the output of that rendering

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:24,650
in the image so for future we have to go

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:29,030
out and collect data because as we saw

00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:36,800
before similar region has a low number

00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:43,790
of kilometer of path we need to realize

00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:47,710
event with the high chapter to inform

00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:52,090
them about these activities to get

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:56,930
feedback and to try to create a local

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:59,510
group of people able to insert data but

00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:04,850
especially to review the existing data

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:08,510
and the last goal is to create a group

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:16,520
of Chi member able to keep the data

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:20,480
up-to-date so to have someone that are

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:25,610
really used to work with token stream

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:34,010
app they know all the different problem

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:38,780
or different tricks thanks to everyone

00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:44,259
now should be the time of question but

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:47,299
now should be the time of few question 1

00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:49,100
thank you very much Luka for your

00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:53,119
interesting presentation about situation

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:57,470
of the I king him in Italy and the work

00:21:53,119 --> 00:22:00,769
done with Kyle so we have some some

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:03,019
question that are regarding I have just

00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:04,249
a pretty question I will lost the more

00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:08,539
or less the slide where you are showing

00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:10,999
the percentage of the the math being in

00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:12,409
the different area of Italy do we have a

00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:14,149
brief conclusion do you think that there

00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:16,909
is something that can be done in

00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:18,470
particular to to make to reach different

00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:21,009
the different level in the different

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,009
parts of Italy

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,819
[Music]

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:35,240
we are some

00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:35,240
an issue you enter it another account oh

00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:45,900
okay we can inter sorry right okay okay

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,690
you can give me because the chromium

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,360
crash when you was starting the question

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,580
so I didn't listen anything sorry

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,210
my question was just a general question

00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:00,810
about the state of the art now which how

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,820
many are the paths that are already

00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,460
inside OpenStreetMap how many are not

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,590
present you say that it is partly the

00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,720
solution is to involve the community of

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,850
Kyle do you think there is something

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:20,100
organized something that is opening an

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:23,310
ex-mob should so do the Cova the

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:28,410
situation there was really few

00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:31,260
activities all the exit fork I was

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:37,530
blocked so probably there are not many

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:46,040
advanced activities and we are now

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:53,490
working to to restart all the events and

00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:54,930
courses because until two weeks ago it

00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,380
was not possible to do more or less

00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,040
anything here so it was everything

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,700
stopped

00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,190
yeah sure it's happening losses the part

00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,680
of work we have now more technical

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,290
question especially regarding the

00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,330
routing for hikers is there dedicated

00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,520
routing or rockets in Italy or someone

00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,050
else you say something in your

00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,200
presentation maybe the question was done

00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:21,270
before maybe you can say which are the

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,740
one that you recommend for for the use

00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,710
and they are requests

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,300
there are recommending text to be twelve

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:34,710
hiking routing compared to the normal

00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:37,530
routine so about what tool there is for

00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:40,980
example in front it has a routing inside

00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:43,320
so the official Chi application has some

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,169
routing that is using the

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:51,780
OpenStreetMap data you can use the

00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:55,290
Osmond and they create the route using

00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:59,100
the normal tag and there are no specific

00:24:55,290 --> 00:25:01,880
tags for acting routing so you can use

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:06,380
the normal tag and after the Rooter

00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:10,710
should be done for I curse you cannot

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:12,630
modify the data to improve the Rooter

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,570
but the Rooter should be improved with

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:17,370
the data of open stream app you should

00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:20,040
use a dedicated routing for dissection

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:22,190
if you want you have the the web become

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:26,040
disabled if you would like to attack and

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:29,700
if I touch it probably I have some

00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,650
problem with Kenosha no no profit there

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,360
is a question about the maintenance e

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:36,299
because they say does a really a

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,630
relation type a people root tarp very

00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:45,660
odd they can be broken I will do

00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:49,530
detective broken yeah so it's a well

00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:55,470
known problem we are using the Rooter

00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:58,679
analyzer to track a little bit that the

00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:01,320
relation is still correct and this is

00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,590
the next step for future we have to

00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,840
think how to maintain all the relation

00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:09,210
because they were speaking about several

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,830
thousand of relation and it's quite

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:17,790
difficult but as I told in the

00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:22,429
presentation our plan is to have a good

00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:27,540
base of Chi volunteering that are

00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:37,410
managing the the check of route and the

00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:38,519
relation to area is to have people that

00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,860
are for

00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,549
soon on this hospital yeah area of

00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:51,869
interest

00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:55,600
yeah the ransoms from Rikers sorry okay

00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:58,210
it's easy to Anjali between my speak and

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,330
when you when you're listening I'm

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:04,119
trying to make it a question now it is

00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:05,830
dangerous for I caps when when they are

00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:08,320
hiking paths that having called Peter

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,840
Branca or even not updating the specific

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,499
area how do you do how do you deal with

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:21,429
this okay so this question was done from

00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:23,590
some guy in 2007 or 2008 and my answer

00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:26,169
is more or less the same so if you go

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:30,090
out you have to look in front of you and

00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:35,259
not on the map because a lot of people

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:38,379
using is using map from 80s still and

00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:40,330
the data are completely broken so I

00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:45,869
think that the first stuff is to use

00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:51,450
your brain and check if the data are

00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:54,999
respecting or are still useful or not

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:57,610
obviously is a little bit more dangerous

00:27:54,999 --> 00:28:01,240
than with the car but it's the same

00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:05,080
problem if you if you drive a truck you

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,899
just look the map you don't look the

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,519
senior you can arrive in a point that

00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:16,090
you can not go go horn so for my point

00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:19,840
of view the first off is the brain and

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:23,830
you go out and after yeah of course the

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:28,779
updated map is really useful and you

00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:32,320
make differences but you can okay until

00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:36,240
now you we survive without any mobile

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:41,980
application we have a paper with really

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:44,610
low resolution and there was no problem

00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:48,009
now the stuff a little bit better

00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:51,039
obviously they are not updated are not

00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:51,460
good and we are trying to update more

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,720
they

00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:58,300
as possible about this topic there is a

00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,520
question that is requesting

00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:04,050
there are are any other arcing clocks

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:09,220
interesting this great work in Italy I

00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:11,050
think that sorry

00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,880
there are some are some other cycling

00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:15,730
clubs about English mostly all right

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,360
inside the Chi once in system was the

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:23,220
biggest one in the National one yeah

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:27,630
there are some other Association like

00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:32,200
fear that is the italian federation for

00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:36,940
hiking but i don't know if they are

00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:42,690
working on this topic - I know that

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:47,830
there was some work near Jana vagina and

00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:49,750
but I have no clear idea about the other

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:53,590
Association I also know there are

00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:55,960
another Association that is zero working

00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:59,170
the translation is something like that

00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,950
and they are using open stream up to

00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:06,490
four day route so the stuff are moving

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:09,760
because open stream has the capability

00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:15,400
to be modified by everyone and there are

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:19,660
a lot of data of path and and it's a

00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:21,730
good situation for a car to use up a

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:25,300
streamer instead Google or other

00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:31,660
provider that are more focused on on car

00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:33,730
and on car me mainly there is a question

00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,040
that they request how many how many

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,940
people how many markers are mapping for

00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,940
for the project

00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:49,809
I have really no idea I know that there

00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:52,320
are maybe under people because I knew at

00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:55,029
least 50 or something like that

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,370
according the the courses that we did

00:30:55,029 --> 00:31:01,990
and other people that are working

00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:04,029
already in hiking paths but I have no

00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,850
clear idea for example for the south of

00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:12,190
Italy I know that there are some group

00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:16,269
of people that are adding data related

00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:20,019
to hiking path there are there is a big

00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:25,960
community about people with mouton bike

00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:29,350
and they are also improving so hiking

00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:33,070
path and so on I have no idea okay

00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:34,419
a lot the number so there is a more

00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,330
technical question

00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:44,760
are you using GPS we are dk2 better map

00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:50,519
the path in the mountains I'm using

00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:56,110
Garmin GPS I didn't use the still the

00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:58,690
some RTK to improve the the data also

00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:05,409
because my mobile is not supporting

00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:08,529
still the real-time correction or also

00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:12,190
post-processing correction but yeah this

00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:15,059
could really be useful because in the

00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:20,679
mountain there are a lot of noise do the

00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:22,510
the trees and and also the the mountain

00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:25,149
the shape of the mountain they make a

00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:28,210
lot of noise so this could be really

00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:32,350
useful to improve the data but at the

00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:34,179
other time if we are wrong of not many

00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:37,059
meters is not a big problem because

00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:39,940
there are no many paths in the mountain

00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:43,149
so if we have a error about 10 meters

00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:46,600
it could be not a big problem obviously

00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:49,659
if there is one meter Pro error it's

00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:52,600
better than 10 meter but right now I

00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:54,310
think that a meter could be a good

00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:59,460
resolution for

00:32:54,310 --> 00:33:02,230
I can part okay thanks very much I'm

00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,840
angry with you I think there are not so

00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:07,000
much laughing inside there and only

00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,070
there are not so much part inside the

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,880
mountain so there is harder to choose

00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,400
the wrong one

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,410
if you evolve if is wrong by five meter

00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,760
you have just this one on on the

00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,320
mountain you don't have channels there

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,070
may which you have to choose which one

00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:23,200
we have to take so there is just a few

00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:26,350
comments thank you for for the work at

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,760
all I am do just like to ask it was the

00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,860
last question do you think that this

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,990
work would be done in and some other

00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:34,570
part of the world if there are some

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:37,870
other community of I think that are

00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:39,250
interesting in importing the data inside

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,200
open strip what do you think that is

00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,670
something that can be redone and

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:50,320
repeated in some other part of the world

00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:53,050
I think yes because it's not a really

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,430
specific stuff we have just collected

00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:59,380
the data from all the Chi chapter and

00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:01,390
asked them to provide more information

00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:05,620
as possible maybe some picture some time

00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:08,440
also so yeah it's possible to replicate

00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:13,060
and I'm really happy if someone else

00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:16,180
want to replicated to at them and it's

00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:18,220
just not import because we didn't import

00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:22,900
any details to complicate to import this

00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:27,520
kind of data and but we we map or I map

00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:31,210
the data that the Kai provide me and yes

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,940
so I show in the presentation we use

00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:37,960
some some cool the tasking manager to

00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:42,370
provide some helping tool for other

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:45,430
people and we can share our workflow and

00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:47,890
yes for sure it's possible to replicate

00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:50,970
and I think that opens him up is really

00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:54,670
a good platform for this kind of data

00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:57,400
okay thank you very much Graziella for

00:34:54,670 --> 00:35:00,480
your presentation so this is the end of

00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:05,400
this vodka see you in the English

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,400
