This presentation describes the ongoing work at the Urban Analytics Lab at the National University of Singapore, developing novel methods to assess building completeness at a multi-country scale, as part of a broader project of generating 3D city models on a large-scale using OpenStreetMap.

Quality assessment of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data has been an important topic since the inception of the project. Much research has been done on this topic by many research groups around the world, and it can mostly be seen as permutations of three aspects: (1) spatial data quality element(s) in focus (e.g. positional accuracy, completeness), (2) theme (e.g. amenities, buildings, roads), (3) geographical area (e.g. particular city or country); e.g. positional accuracy of cultural features in Italy.
Completeness is one of the principal quality aspects of geospatial data, and our research focuses on developing a method to assess the completeness of buildings in OSM on a large scale (spanning several countries). While there are many robust OpenStreetMap completeness techniques and studies developed, they mainly focus on limited areas, mostly developed countries with ground truth data at hand for comparisons.
Doing the same for less developed regions is rare as the lack of authoritative data inherently hampers it, and the methods hardly ever scale: such an analysis done simultaneously for more than one administrative region is seldom carried out as there are other research challenges such as disparate urban morphology, different data sources and standards to bridge in order to facilitate ground truth, and varying understanding of what a building is. Furthermore, the development of a method that would scale across dozens of countries is limited by computational resources.
We are currently developing a method that uses several indicators derived from remote sensing, which are available on the global level, that may hint at the building completeness and would scale across the world. A regression model to predict the approximate volume of buildings in a given area is trained in areas in which there is an indication of high completeness of buildings in OSM.
OSM building completeness is estimated by comparing the number of mapped buildings against their expected (predicted) amount in reality. The method has the potential to scale at a worldwide level, and completeness is estimated for a grid of resolution of approximately 1x1 square kilometres, and simultaneously for administrative regions to enable cross-country comparisons.
The work is being implemented in Google Earth Engine, mostly relying on imagery and indicators such as normalised difference built-up index (NDBI) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI).
Preliminary results suggest a substantial disparity in OSM building completeness around the world, with areas that are entirely complete to those with inadequate completeness.
This presentation aims to report the progress of the ongoing work and encountered challenges in the project such as selecting indicators that are consistently available on the global level, scaling the method to the global level, accounting for different mapping practices around the world, different notions of a building, and varying morphologies of cities and urban areas. We also investigate the relation between OSM building completeness and socio-economic parameters such as GDP to understand their relationships to mapping intensity and quality. These may offer the potential to be used as additional predictors.
This work is part of a broader project conducted at the Urban Analytics Lab at the National University of Singapore on investigating the potential of generating 3D city models by extruding building footprints in OpenStreetMap to a building height that is predicted using artificial intelligence. This ongoing portion of the project is the crucial first step in the project, as it will enable us to understand what is the completeness of building footprints in OpenStreetMap around the world and manage expectations about the potential coverage of 3D city models.

morning noon afternoon night whatever

00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:17,000
time zone in and welcome to the second

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:21,470
day of step of the math money online

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,520
conference and to the academics we're

00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:27,800
really happy that we were able to offer

00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,920
another edition of that let me back this

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:35,570
year it's a third year in a row we have

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,989
two very successful track days in the

00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:41,320
two previous state of the map and we're

00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:46,640
looking forward for this year's track

00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:48,949
which will include 10 talks different

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,140
topics starting from building

00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:54,409
completeness and discussions about

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:57,530
humanitarian mapping corporate editing

00:00:54,409 --> 00:01:05,269
identifying informal settlements and so

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:08,630
on and just before we start the first

00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:11,710
talk a few notes first of all anyone

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,189
interested in OpenStreetMap research

00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:18,950
research is welcome to join the or some

00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:22,189
science mailing list where we sometimes

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:28,700
have discussions about research related

00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:32,869
issues second if it's your first state

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:37,009
of the map table or this year you can

00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:39,259
ask questions using the session pad we

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:42,649
will after I'll introduce our first

00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:46,210
speaker will watch the recording of the

00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:49,460
talk and then we'll have a Q&A session

00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,109
so if you want to ask questions during

00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,240
the talk and also during the Q&A session

00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:55,609
you just need to log on to the pad and

00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:00,140
write your question down to log on to

the pad you mean to share my screen for

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:13,300
that you need to just go to the program

00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:15,010
on the website look for your

beside that if you want to know more

00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:40,780
about the books were having just before

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:44,650
the conference committee which includes

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:47,260
my own meaning and event and Peter

Mooney and Godwin you boys an accordion

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,190
and myself we published the Proceedings

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,720
of the abstracts of the academic track

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,960
you can find them on sonoda or just

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,430
google state of the map for in 24

00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,180
sittings and you can read more about

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,400
each talk and see the details of the

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,290
different authors so you're welcome to

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,290
join in its open access

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:20,920
yes so I think that's that's it

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:25,180
regarding its kind of technical notes

00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:28,270
and I think we can move in to our figure

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,000
first speaker which is a faithfully

00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:33,160
Jackie he's an assistant professor in

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,560
Jes at the National University of

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,840
Singapore his main domain of interest

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,500
are 3d city models and spatial data

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,540
quality he holds a PhD from the Delft

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:48,010
University of Technology in the

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:50,590
Netherlands and we're very happy to have

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,180
Philip here and hear about this issue of

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,790
freedom modelling and building

00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:02,980
completeness and so on now it's time for

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:04,510
us watch the talk hello everyone I'm

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,550
Philippa yes Keith from the National

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,200
University of Singapore thanks for

00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,890
having me at this event and thanks to

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,720
the organizers for putting you together

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,020
today I'm presenting a project and

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,000
generating 3d city models from

00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,010
OpenStreetMap particularly focusing on

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,210
assessing the quality of voice and data

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:27,250
to understand the potential of doing so

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,620
the work is called

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:34,240
young women who is student researcher on

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:36,430
this project so I tell us we have a

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,010
project for developing a method to ease

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:41,230
the generation of 3d CT models on a

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:44,020
large scale so we can make them more

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,650
accessible especially in areas where

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,360
they have not been previously available

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,270
OpenStreetMap is an important part of

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,430
the project and one of the aides is

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,430
enriched buildings from OpenStreetMap

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,830
with information on their height once

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,840
the data is generated another part of

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,180
the project is investigating use cases

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,810
for which they are useful which I will

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:10,600
also briefly talk about the project is

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,790
funded by our University we are just a

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,820
few months in the project so what is

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:19,000
presented in this talk are just very

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:21,520
preliminary results and one of the aims

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,860
of this presentation is rather to gather

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,020
feedback and ideas but also to spread

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,340
the word about this project which may be

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,750
found useful to others in the community

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,060
before I proceed I would like to

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,590
acknowledge my colleague young-shin and

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,630
your researcher in the project who

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,690
started working recently and has

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,010
provided a few preliminary results and

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,840
also I'd like to thank the Netherlands

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,729
Organization for scientific research for

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,260
funding a previous project which this

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:53,110
project builds on to give some context

00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,030
to the work especially to those who

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,130
haven't had much touch with 3d city

00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,190
models before I'll spend a few minutes

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,560
talking about them 3d city models are

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:05,020
urban scale 3d representations of the

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,150
built environment representing our 3d

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,750
world more truthfully essentially

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,550
upgrading traditional 2d GL statuses

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:15,910
they have been used across multiple

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,950
disciplines and the heavenly enabled new

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,700
spatial applications or having proved

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:24,010
existing analysis this slide shows an

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,590
example I always include when talking

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,380
about 3d city walls its view shed

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,840
analysis from a window of a house on the

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,630
left you can see it done with a 2d data

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,750
set but running the same analysis with a

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:40,199
3d city model on the right adds more

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,719
accuracy and insights

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,460
today the city models are definitely not

00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:47,580
new but the developments around them

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,889
have surged in the last 5 to 10 years

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,009
with not only lots of papers published

00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:55,430
in academia but also an iteration in

00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,930
disciplines beyond the geospatial field

00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,879
altogether with an increasing

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,729
availability of data and software and

00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:05,610
further many people know 3d city models

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:06,930
just for some cool visualizations but

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,580
they are actually now increasingly

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,680
finding their role in spatial analysis

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,779
estimating shadows is another example we

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,779
can use 3d city models to estimate the

00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:20,729
level of sunlight on the street level it

00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:23,159
is an analysis that is not possible

00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:25,590
without 3d data among different

00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:27,389
applications this analysis helped to

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,779
understand the thermal comfort of

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:33,509
pedestrians since the state of the map

00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:36,719
community has pretty much open science

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:38,360
stance I think it's relevant to mention

00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:41,039
that this analysis has been done

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:46,789
entirely using open data in open

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:50,490
installed software some further examples

00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:53,789
some partition ELLs use 3d city models

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,399
to make noise pollution max so we can

00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:58,560
use 3d city models to estimate the

00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,629
impact of noise in different traffic

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,550
scenarios for example when planning new

00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:08,580
tram lines in cities these datasets are

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:12,300
indispensable for wind flow analysis an

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,949
example of another use case they helped

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,139
us to understand the impact of new

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,449
advancing areas on the wind flow here is

00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:21,330
an example from Singapore down by the

00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,129
national mapping agency here this use

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:28,259
case is especially useful in tropical

00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:31,020
climates so with all the increasing use

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:34,680
cases it is not really a surprise that

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:37,589
many cities have adopted them and using

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,630
for various purposes today there are

00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:42,060
dozens of cities that have a 3d system

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:46,269
model and many of them released them as

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:49,059
open data one of my

00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:50,649
is the data set by New York City which

00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:53,259
has more than a million of buildings

00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:59,499
model in 3d and they have released this

00:08:53,259 --> 00:09:01,660
as open data so how are they made there

00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:04,119
are many ways to produce 3d city models

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,009
like from photogrammetric surveys or

00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:10,509
converting them from architectural

00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:13,209
models but the most common metal so far

00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:15,699
is extrusion that is to take advantage

00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:19,269
of existing 2d data sets such as

00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:22,869
topographic maps and external buildings

00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:24,490
and other features to their heights the

00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:27,309
heights are obtained from different

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,889
sources most commonly from lidar point

00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:33,670
clouds or as an attribute stored in the

00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:34,540
building data and this method results in

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,809
the so called

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:44,679
block models or LOD one models with flat

00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:47,199
rooftops the topic of 3d city models is

00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:50,170
not new to the OpenStreetMap community

00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:53,559
in fact it has been around for more than

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:56,709
a decade there are different ways to

00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:59,410
obtain 3d city models from OSM first

00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:02,230
from the store height of the building or

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:05,139
its number of floors and then extruding

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,269
the building footprint second it is

00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:10,179
possible to provide more detailed

00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:12,279
representations using certain text for

00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:14,740
example the type of fire roof of a

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:20,079
building resulting in 3d models with a

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:23,230
higher level of detail this is an

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:26,079
example of OSF data in 3d thanks to the

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,059
project or assembly links it is the

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,660
central business district in Singapore

00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:34,059
it is interesting because it shows data

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,059
that arise from both types of modeling

00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:39,339
on the left you can see a few

00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:41,290
skyscrapers extruded to their height

00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:44,889
according to the number of floors in OS

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,360
m but you can also see a couple of

00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:48,519
nicely modeled buildings such as

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,199
landmarks next to the water at the

00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,199
bottom and bottom right of the image

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:03,139
so where is the gap and why are we doing

00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:05,480
this research OpenStreetMap is great but

00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:08,689
mostly the datasets in the world remain

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,569
require by local governments often they

00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:13,369
are not released as open data and

00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:16,579
they're almost exclusive to developed

00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:19,160
countries and major cities virtually all

00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:24,019
3d open datasets are from Europe and

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,669
North America and why is that

00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:29,839
why are 3d city model is not available

00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:32,029
widely the main reason for this limited

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,160
availability is that they can be

00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:35,689
expensive or complicated to create

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:45,649
because collecting heights of buildings

00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:49,189
is cumbersome if you check OSM data

00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:50,689
without outside city centers you will

00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:54,109
see that the links more often than not

00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:56,419
have no height information whatsoever so

00:11:54,109 --> 00:12:04,009
they cannot be extruded to their true

00:11:56,419 --> 00:12:04,429
height in fact in many places around the

00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,049
world

00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:10,429
buildings have low completeness of

00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:12,079
heights or the number of floors there

00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,939
are many places that are wonderfully

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,610
mapped with an impressive level of

00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:19,790
quality but data on building Heights or

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:23,089
number of floors can be entirely missing

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:26,480
even in such places as an example I

00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:30,290
recently analyzed OpenStreetMap data for

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,720
11 countries in Southeast Asia again osm

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,089
data in some places looks fantastic but

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,759
in most cases the share of buildings

00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:42,829
that have height information is lower

00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:44,899
than 1% even in the best case like in

00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:47,209
small countries such as brunei and

00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:50,649
singapore the completeness is just

00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:53,539
around 10% and this is not surprising

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,850
because not only takes time to collect

00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:59,449
such data or it might be difficult to do

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:02,089
so but another possible reason is that

00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:04,759
metals might not be motivated to collect

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:07,879
them as they may not be convinced that

00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:10,940
they are important so we are also

00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:13,220
working on use cases and fast

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,890
the potential and benefit of having 3d

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:22,550
buildings generated for my son not just

00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:24,440
for some nice visualizations the

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,210
research question that our project is

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,460
attempting to tackle is how can we

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:32,120
increase the availability of heights of

00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,680
buildings in OpenStreetMap is there an

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:42,830
alternative method to collect the

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:45,050
building Heights our hypothesis is that

00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:48,020
we can predict the heights of the links

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:52,040
solely from building footprints that is

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,900
existing 2d data and OpenStreetMap going

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,390
back to the figure I have shown a few

00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,520
slides earlier we are looking into

00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,110
whether we can skip the second step of

00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,920
having height information of all

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:06,260
buildings simply by predicting them from

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:14,270
the 2d data such as geometry of the

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:15,500
links and attributes and actually this

00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,050
is not a new idea

00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,020
I personally worked on the preceding

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:24,500
work three years ago where we built a

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,600
regression model then the forest to

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:31,100
predict the heights of buildings from

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:34,160
their footprints the work was focused on

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,720
Rotterdam in the Netherlands and this

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,200
project looks whether we can scale it

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,540
globally the image on this slide shows

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:49,160
the 3d model of Rotterdam generated

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:51,220
without height data I should mention

00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,710
that in the mean time there has been

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,570
other related work for example doing

00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,030
something similar for the United States

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:01,280
and Germany giving assurance that we

00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:09,880
might be on the right path and that this

00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:14,260
project is relevant in

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,990
the idea is simple for each building we

00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,720
compute a series of predictors used by

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:23,500
the regression model these predictors

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,860
come from three groups first we take

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,320
several geometry indicators for which we

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:32,830
need just the polygon of or the link for

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:35,490
example we quantify the shape complexity

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,930
and the number of neighboring buildings

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,630
we are doing that because we have

00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:45,390
realized that these are associated with

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:48,480
the height of a building second we take

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:51,220
socio-economic data on a district scale

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,790
for example we have realized that the

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,770
income of the neighborhood is negatively

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:00,370
correlated with the heights of the

00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:02,350
buildings their third to be incorporated

00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,680
various colossal attributes such as year

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:09,220
of construction and what we did in

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,320
Rotterdam was surprisingly accurate the

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:16,660
mean absolute error of predicting

00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:19,240
Heights was below one meter now we want

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,550
to scale this to OpenStreetMap globally

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,280
to increase the completeness of Heights

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:29,260
helping us to generate 3d city models

00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:31,180
everywhere but there is a big but what

00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:34,690
we did in Rotterdam was also very

00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,820
localized we do not have detailed

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:40,960
socio-economic data in colossal data

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:43,270
globally that we can use and even if we

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,490
did have the predictive models would

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:53,449
probably not be very transferable

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:57,889
elsewhere so for the global scale

00:16:53,449 --> 00:17:00,529
and doing so using OpenStreetMap data we

00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:02,389
will have to use only the 2d geometry of

00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:05,589
buildings and making most of the

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:08,299
predictors that we can come up with

00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,949
training the regression model in one of

00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:12,709
the cities in the Netherlands was easy

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:14,510
the government has an open point cloud

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,870
data set from which the building height

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,389
can be estimated

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,230
but because the ground truth for

00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:23,449
building heights

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,850
which is required for training the

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:28,370
predictive models is available not for

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,110
many cities around the world we were

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:33,230
thinking about training predictive

00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:36,230
models in one city where we have the

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,090
point clouds and then using the same

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:42,620
predictive models to predict the heights

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:45,500
in another city and that is what we did

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:48,409
we trained the predictive model in one

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,990
Dutch province and applied it to other

00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:55,940
ones and evaluated the accuracy of the

00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:58,880
predictions of the building heights and

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,610
how does that work using the geometry of

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,409
footprints in OpenStreetMap resulted in

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:08,000
the prediction of Heights having a mean

00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:11,929
absolute error of 2.4 meters which is

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,350
about the height of one storey this is

00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:16,010
not extremely accurate but it's also not

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,380
bad

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,350
given the circumstances and it might be

00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,149
better than nothing we think that the 3d

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,730
models generated with this level of

00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:28,700
accuracy will still be useful for some

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:33,139
use cases that would otherwise not be

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:35,600
possible because of the lack of data for

00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:38,149
example 3d models obtained with such

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,760
accuracy level could be useful for

00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:44,570
creating shadow maps like the one on

00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,639
this image and this may help

00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:53,080
understanding the solar exposure of

00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:55,330
streets and thermal comfort still

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,510
what we did is mostly within the same

00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:01,690
country and might not work well

00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:04,750
somewhere else so we are not getting

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,780
fully excited at this stage we can do

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,360
the same for other countries but

00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:14,590
eventually not many of them because

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:17,320
lighter data is scarcely available for

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:19,450
example we don't think that we can train

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,140
the predictive models in Mexico and

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:25,240
expect that they will work well in Kenya

00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,540
but what we are thinking is doing

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,450
something different in each city we plan

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:35,770
to focus on the fraction of buildings in

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:37,990
OSM that have height information to

00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:41,260
Train City specific regression models

00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:43,240
and then predict the height of the

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:47,380
remaining portion of buildings that do

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:50,590
not have them and that is where research

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:56,560
on understanding osm completeness is

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:58,960
crucial it is crucial because we need to

00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:03,150
understand the areas that are mapped

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,920
well for two reasons for training the

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:09,970
regression models and for generating the

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:12,370
3d city models it doesn't make sense to

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:15,940
generate 3d models in areas where the

00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:18,070
building completeness is low and also it

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,070
doesn't make sense to Train regression

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,930
models to predict the heights in areas

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:30,070
where the height completeness is very

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:32,710
very low if I have

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:36,630
to draw a diagram of this intertwined

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:40,780
completeness it will look like this

00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,860
first osm represents a subset of all

00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,230
buildings in the world

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,760
it is quite complete but there are areas

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,160
that are not entirely mapped

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,430
so understanding building completeness

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,540
is the crucial first step to help us

00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:58,570
identify areas that we should skip

00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:03,480
second height information is available

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,480
for a fraction of buildings at our Maps

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,130
understanding patterns of completeness

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:12,040
of this type of information will help us

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:14,890
focus on areas where we can train the

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,650
regression models so we can predict the

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,700
heights of the rest of the buildings

00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:28,060
increasing the potential and calm

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:31,240
instance of 3d city models this research

00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:33,580
is conceptually simple as a start we

00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,520
have focus on the capital cities of the

00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,710
11 countries in Southeast Asia for most

00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,650
cities the building completeness is high

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,650
so we focus on the completeness of

00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,240
heights or number of floats we have

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,520
calculated the completeness of the

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,560
height attributes and aggregated the

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:55,540
percentage for cells of one square

00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:57,820
kilometer and this is the result it is

00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:01,540
very interesting to see that some cells

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:04,650
have 100 percents of completeness while

00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:08,260
the neighborhood next door is almost 0%

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:10,420
so this research on completeness helps

00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,090
us to understand that we might be able

00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,310
to focus on these small pockets that

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,620
have full completeness to train the

00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:25,270
predictive models and then apply them to

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:27,100
the rest of the city that was the simple

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,620
part but the tricky part is the

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,810
completeness of footprints there have

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,960
been many studies on estimating the

00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,790
completeness of building data in osm

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,330
many of them are focused on one country

00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:42,190
and they do one-to-one comparison thanks

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,620
to authoritative data usually for the

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,240
government

00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,700
for example they calculate the number of

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,170
buildings in OSM and compare it to the

00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,020
number of buildings in the government

00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:58,260
counterpart but these methods do not

00:22:53,020 --> 00:23:02,890
work on the global scale the main focus

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:05,080
is the lack of alternative data that and

00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,520
their computational expenses but also

00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,560
there are different definitions around

00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:14,260
the world what a building is how are we

00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,710
taking that the method that we are

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,390
developing is simplified we think that

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,840
it is very difficult to do one-to-one

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:26,200
comparisons and it doesn't make sense to

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:29,350
do so on a global scale instead we

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:32,800
rather focus on estimating the building

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,960
completeness roughly in patches instead

00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,380
of individual buildings we focus on

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,470
areas by partitioning the world in one

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,690
by one kilometer cells the same as in

00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:46,360
one of the earlier slides and for each

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:49,330
we estimate the approximate level of

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:53,800
footprint completeness rather than doing

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:57,010
so precisely for each building we train

00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,800
our predictive model that uses remotely

00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:03,370
sensed data to estimate the proportion

00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,320
of the built-up area in each cell and

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,750
then compare it with the percentage of

00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,660
the area in the cell that is covered by

00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,760
OpenStreetMap at the moment we are

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:18,520
implementing this in Google Earth engine

00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:22,090
using Landsat 8 data the results we have

00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,850
are very preliminary we are running the

00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:28,270
code on a few locations in East and

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:30,280
Southeast Asia and unfortunately we do

00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:35,050
not have done a validation yet so we

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:37,810
cannot tell how reliable it is but we

00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:39,880
learned the fitting so far and these are

00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,520
very similar to the issues encountered

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,860
during height estimations first the

00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,400
predictive models trained in one area

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:51,250
may not work well elsewhere the second

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,400
issue is computational even though our

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,530
metal strives for simplicity it is still

00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,100
computationally expensive

00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:04,300
because there dozens of millions of

00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:06,130
cells around the world to analyze we are

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,350
wondering whether we actually need to do

00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:11,290
so for absolutely every cell in the

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:14,740
world or can we rather pick a subset in

00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:17,860
each country like 5% of its land area

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,690
and run the analysis for the subset to

00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:23,290
get a general idea of completeness for

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:26,050
each country most completeness studies

00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,780
that focus on one country and not

00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:31,480
globally are tariffs but maybe when

00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:36,670
assessing the completeness globally we

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,730
do not have to be that detailed for the

00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,620
next steps we plan to incorporate other

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,900
data sets for example roads in

00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,780
OpenStreetMap are quite complete and

00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:49,330
they may serve as an indicator of amount

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:53,290
of fillings in an area we plan to

00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:57,310
validate the method as well that has

00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:58,930
been our work so far if you find this

00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,940
project of interest I would like to

00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:04,360
invite you to connect with us and

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:06,550
discuss our possible cooperation I also

00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,310
hope that if generating the 3d models

00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:12,070
works out that other researchers will

00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:14,110
find it useful in their activities we'll

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:17,170
definitely make it available as open

00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:19,750
data as soon as we have something and

00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:22,210
once the pandemic is over we are welcome

00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:24,790
to having visiting scholars as well at

00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:27,880
our research group feel free to contact

00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:32,080
us if interested we are planning to work

00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,270
further on osm related topics thank you

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,470
and thanks again to the organizers of

00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,470
the event for all their work

00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,119
[Music]

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:13,920
okay Thank You Philip or very this

00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:16,410
kickoff to the academic track I've been

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,900
already seen a lot in the question pad

00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:24,800
that your book generated a little

00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:27,720
interest with indeed IO and foots really

00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:34,470
expected looking forward for the results

00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:37,140
and how it can contribute to the project

00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:42,920
itself I think it really wasn't miss

00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:45,810
overview of 3d modeling and next up

00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:52,170
OpenStreetMap and the challenges and

00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:53,880
opportunities that exist so I'll go

00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,380
straight to the questions there are

00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,240
quite a few of them so I'm not sure

00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:01,170
whether we'll be able to go through all

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:04,010
of them but we'll go through them one by

00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:07,740
one see how far can we go

00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:14,220
anyone else can can contact infinite

00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:16,920
individually and require further so we

00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,020
have an enormous question about how can

00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:22,050
we easily estimate building height while

00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:26,790
mapping one comment already says that

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:28,950
there's there's a user named Colossus

00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:32,010
that presented a budget lighter for

00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:34,860
crowdsourcing 3d data but it's probably

00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:36,150
only suitable for small buildings Philip

00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,080
do you have any other kinds of

00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:42,180
recommendations okay first of all thanks

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,450
again for having me here and thanks

00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:47,550
everyone for the interesting questions

00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:49,830
regarding the estimation of building

00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,810
heights while mapping actually there are

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,120
two things two types of information

00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:57,390
first is the building height in meters

00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:01,290
and second is actually building levels

00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:05,370
and most mappers I would say like 10

00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:07,050
times more of them focus on mapping the

00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,940
building levels which are obviously much

00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,830
easier to map because it's related to

00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,660
count the number of floors

00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:16,410
on the other hand it's really difficult

00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:19,380
to estimate the height but I've seen the

00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:22,920
bits and developments recently so I've

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:25,650
seen there is a app on the phone I think

00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,400
it works only on iOS that measures the

00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:33,540
height of a building from pictures and

00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:35,910
the second I heard recently of a method

00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:39,620
by if you have public access to building

00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:42,570
by counting the number of steps to the

00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:45,930
rooftop and then multiplying it with the

00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:47,790
height of each step so there there are a

00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:50,550
few methods but it's way more difficult

00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:59,130
and then counting the number of building

00:29:50,550 --> 00:30:04,350
levels it's interesting ideas in some

00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:10,200
cases I'll be all done which is this

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:12,630
paper the next speaker asks can you

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,120
discuss more about the future importance

00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:19,920
for your reinforced model in your study

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,870
in the Netherlands and I would you say

00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:25,830
something about the predictive power of

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,690
the budget we don't have no like

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,420
socio-economic data or not necessarily

00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:33,930
have socio-economic data investor data

00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:36,240
and we think there are more variables

00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:38,940
that you can integrate into the model

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,890
which you can use in open street can get

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,250
from open treatment data which will

00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:48,150
assist in achieving higher level of

00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:50,550
accuracy so the work in the Netherlands

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:54,210
in Rotterdam had been done three years

00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:55,770
ago it was using cadastral data and we

00:30:54,210 --> 00:31:02,300
were focused on predicting the heights

00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:07,260
and we had 10 10 predictors and we built

00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:08,550
17 different predictive models based on

00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,410
different combinations of the

00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:12,960
availability so for example in one

00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:15,480
scenario we had the number of floors we

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,920
had the floor area of a building we had

00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:22,050
the socio-economic data in another

00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:24,420
predictive model we had only three

00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,100
predictors that have been

00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,620
calculated from the geometry of the

00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:31,170
footprint in the first case that was

00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:36,720
ideal the number of stories was

00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:39,600
obviously the most useful predictor but

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,060
in those that we when we head on in the

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,560
geometry the most useful predictor was

00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,960
the floor area followed by the

00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:50,520
complexity of the shape of the footprint

00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:55,130
and at the moment we are using about

00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:58,710
five to six predictors that can be

00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:01,890
computed from open strip street map data

00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:04,170
and many more predictors like we can use

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:06,120
certain tags but the issue is that we

00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,830
are looking for predictors that are

00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,560
consistently available on the worldwide

00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:13,230
scale so there are some texts that will

00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,670
be very useful but I'm not sure if it

00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:18,030
makes sense to use them if they're

00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:21,300
available only for 1% of the buildings

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:23,580
around the world at the moment you are

00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:38,160
shooting with a lot of faith in the

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:41,190
floor area a question about also your

00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,170
work in the Netherlands our cities in

00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:48,600
the Netherlands very similar for this to

00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:51,540
work I could imagine question I could

00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:57,030
imagine that it could be more countries

00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:58,980
with all the new cities so yes I think

00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:01,940
everyone who has been in the Netherlands

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:05,640
knows that cities can look quite similar

00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:10,020
which goes in which cost the advantage

00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:12,360
of this methods also I'd like just to

00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,400
follow up with another to another

00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,270
question there was a question about the

00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:21,840
ground plane the answer is yes we assume

00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:24,150
the flat ground plane because in the

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,670
Netherlands all cities are relatively

00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:31,170
flat situated at around elevation 0 but

00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,000
of course we need to take into account

00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,770
terrain in other countries and that's

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,210
what we are planning to do in the next

00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:38,740
phase of the project

00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:41,080
[Music]

00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:44,210
Hey

00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:48,890
yes so now there's a bunch of questions

00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:51,200
about other sources of that our

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:54,410
information that you might want to

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,420
consider for for bikini breaking your

00:33:54,410 --> 00:34:00,020
models whether it's building shadows

00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:05,090
from satellite imagery and I say our

00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:08,720
data from scent alone one and image

00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:11,630
recognition pillory and all sorts of

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,659
stuff so did you consider adding other

00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:18,650
kinds of other sources for to your

00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:20,570
models the predictions of the heights we

00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:23,659
are currently focusing only on vector

00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:26,900
data from OpenStreetMap we are not

00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:32,560
including any earth observation data

00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:35,659
like radar radar data or optical misery

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,280
it's for a simple reason the first is

00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:40,429
that we are not really remote sensing

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,429
specialists but second we would like to

00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:45,429
develop a method that can be like

00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:49,060
self-sufficient that can only use

00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:49,060
OpenStreetMap data as input

00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:57,220
see what other questions we have here

00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:06,680
there's one contender's saying that

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:10,550
Exeter in the UK has around 35% VD

00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,950
building coverage of buildings would be

00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:21,680
a good training set and provides tooling

00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:25,280
so thank you for that because if we

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,350
train the models in the UK we are not

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,060
sure that they will work outside the UK

00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:32,930
is the same problem like with the

00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:36,560
Netherlands so it definitely helps in

00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:39,470
order to train country specific or city

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,330
specific predictive models but we are

00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,100
looking more for a global solution that

00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:46,030
would work everywhere especially in

00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,030
developing countries

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,469
and another question is isn't the

00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:57,229
geometry a bit fuzzy some people map

00:35:54,469 --> 00:36:01,719
very thoroughly other met basic

00:35:57,229 --> 00:36:04,279
footprints so it's a question about bias

00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:08,209
basically in a sense and I would that

00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:10,729
that that did you notice that there's a

00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:14,119
bias in the completeness spatial bias in

00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:15,969
the completeness of height data I think

00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:18,709
you mentioned you talk to yourself that

00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:21,920
usually in city centers you get this

00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:26,089
data but outside of that it's pretty

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:30,349
rare and how they affect so quality will

00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:33,949
definitely play a role but regarding

00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:36,140
completeness indeed we notice that there

00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:41,119
is more height information available for

00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:43,519
landmarks and for CBDs so the predictive

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,459
model might be a bit biased towards this

00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,529
well mapped areas but thoroughly to

00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:54,910
difficult that we haven't made the tour

00:36:48,529 --> 00:36:57,529
of analysis yet thanks for this answer

00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:04,339
nice communication according to the

00:36:57,529 --> 00:37:07,039
person asking the question I said I'm

00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:10,039
glad to hear that

00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,569
can you explain once again how Landsat

00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:14,479
faster is being used for the

00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:17,809
completeness is it being used all right

00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:21,499
so yeah maybe I wasn't really clear in

00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:24,680
that part we are not using imagery to

00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:27,349
predict heights of buildings but the

00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,920
Earth Observation data so far is used to

00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:34,369
understand the completeness of buildings

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,140
so regarding earth observation data and

00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:38,509
raster's the answer is yes you know we

00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,549
are using that data for predicting the

00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:43,219
completeness of buildings but not for

00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:46,959
predicting the heights yet and I think

00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:49,160
based on the amount of questions

00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:51,229
regarding earth observation data I think

00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:55,400
we will reconsider that part of the

00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:57,019
project I think we might then consider

00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,279
including earth observation data as well

00:37:57,019 --> 00:38:00,279
to predict the heights of buildings

00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:05,900
yeah and I I think it's it's a subtle

00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:07,490
point here in your talk that dirt we're

00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,900
talking about - level of completeness

00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:15,369
there's building footprint completeness

00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:19,160
which is important even before we use a

00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:22,339
we go further into 3d or height data

00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:26,769
completeness yes so it's it's two

00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:31,760
different and but interrelated issues I

00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:35,869
would ask let's say the over seven

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:41,210
community decides to go for full follow

00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:44,470
on 3d mapping support projects like

00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:47,210
yourself and just decide to

00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:52,130
hypothetically go city by city and add

00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:54,349
hard data how much what is the rate of

00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:58,910
completeness you would expect is

00:38:54,349 --> 00:39:02,150
required for the moodle's to work well

00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:05,980
enough mmm

00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:10,279
yeah good question we have been testing

00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:13,009
different levels of percentages for the

00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:17,000
training data in work so far in the

00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:19,369
Netherlands I might think that we

00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,730
concluded that between five and ten

00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:25,250
percent of the of the building should be

00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:28,549
mapped in order to estimate the

00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:32,359
remaining buildings with sufficient

00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:34,700
level of accuracy but again we did that

00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:36,740
so far for only one country so this

00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:40,220
might be quite different for other

00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:42,680
countries and given that currently the

00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:48,109
completeness on average in cities is

00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:50,630
less than 1% 5% might still be a bit too

00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:57,319
far so I think we'll have to be happy

00:39:50,630 --> 00:40:00,170
with only 1% okay so all you sweet

00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:03,650
members that want to contribute to our

00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:09,349
3d modeling take notice about how much

00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:11,569
you need to complete yeah thank you very

00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:13,009
much I think

00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:16,849
people were quite interested in your

00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:19,969
talk and learned a lot and we would be

00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:23,869
happy to hear you're talking about it in

00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:26,660
a year or two about results and see see

00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:29,420
what we can learn from that and I think

00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:32,150
with that we would end a talk so thank

00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:35,930
you again thank you I really appreciate

00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:38,059
the interest from everyone yeah and see

00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,759
you on the next talk which would be also

00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:43,430
about building completeness by aldy

00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:45,650
Alton and I hope I pronounced it right

00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:48,670
which would start in about five minutes

00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,670
you'll see

00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,240
you
