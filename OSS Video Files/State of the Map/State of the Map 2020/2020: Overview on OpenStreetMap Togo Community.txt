Le Togo, l’un des plus petits pays de l’Afrique de l’Ouest abrite depuis 2013 une communauté OpenStreetMap. OSM Togo a mise en œuvre de nombreux projets mais a connu également des difficultés. Cette présentation a pour objectif de faire un aperçu sur la vie de la communauté OpenStreetMap Togo.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) considered as the wikipedia of cartography is a Collaborative Mapping Project which exists in several countries around the world. So, Togo, one of the smallest countries of West Africa, has been hosting for more than five years a strong and dynamic OSM community called OpenStreetMap Togo. Several activities, mainly mapathon sessions, mapping parties, and capacity building trainings have been carried out through several projects for various target groups including students, public institutions, civil society organizations, and companies in order to promote the OSM project and to have a quality data on Togo. Highlights of these projects are: "Digital mapping OpenStreetMap as lever for local development in Togo", “GirlsMap, a gender-oriented project implemented in several African countries”, “G roads project (mapping of mainly roads of Togo)”, and “mapping of all pharmacy of Lomé, capital of Togo (CARTOPHARMA)”. Today, there are more than 200 local contributors who, through their actions, are making the OSM data evolve at the country level.  However, like in most OSM communities in Africa and around the world, OSM Togo is sometimes constrained by several difficulties that limit the expansion of the OSM project and the production of better quality data in Togo. The objective of this presentation is to highlight the life of the OSM community in Togo, its projects, strengths, challenges and its difficulties related to quality OSM data production.

go in to support humanitarian action

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:16,520
proof digital mapping from watching in

00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:19,360
opposite map project integral we itself

00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,600
we complete several activities like

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,270
sanitizing and building capacity in

00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,710
OpenStreetMap and freaky I had to that

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,610
public sector

to events in other countries and we

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:57,280
realize some projects in order to

00:02:52,420 --> 00:03:01,130
promote the opposite my project and to

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:06,740

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:11,900
goals so here you can see some pictures

00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:18,010
of our mapping parties matter you can

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:27,070
see the pictures of our local traditions

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:33,550
and then one of the first one of our

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:37,900
interest project is is to map

00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:42,320
conferences after especially our

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:46,000
pharmacists of lowly and to do the

00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:50,380
software we can allow people to located

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,350
the nearest pharmacy in their area

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:56,990
for this project we collated on data and

00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,690
from the series with apples with markers

00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:02,090
and the next step of this project to

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:07,540
develop the software and our sheraton

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:16,100
for people we can use it for the

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:18,680
occasion so another project path

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:23,960
opposite map toggle it digital mapping

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:26,570

highway of Togo and the second one is a

00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:39,259
bus line map in the me

00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:42,619
this project will protect we realized

00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:49,519
with the support of Transportation

Society a follow me and today we have

00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,209
collected

00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:03,700
first up points and filters we feel not

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:06,520
all burst lines and the oppose with mom

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,460
database so if you want to consider the

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,260
original this process we can here here

toggle in training with two with the a

00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:28,630
jet of so travel transportation society

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,680
of blooming you can see the map or for

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:35,410
blue slang

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:39,270
after rock in consider the opposite my

total members in ecology collected

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:49,450
interest points to transportation like

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:55,740
the Stars and shadow to add them to

00:07:49,450 --> 00:08:03,550
appreciate my bitumen in determine of

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:12,130
the main of Sanitation we analyze we

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:16,270
think about how we can use use

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:23,190
OpenStreetMap throughs in to respond to

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:30,600
the Maya issues of proliferation of Y

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:36,000
downsides I began I began turns out in

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:45,580
the discipline of the rock on tv3 Tito's

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:50,860
suits west so test of Fulani this

00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:54,700
project is we reconnect in this project

00:08:50,860 --> 00:09:00,670
we collect a downsides of this suburb

00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:06,190
and we put it to the interactive map to

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:11,500
sensitize people around the periphery

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:13,350
of the downside in this area and also to

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,360
orient action of a sanitation

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:21,819
organization um well it is very urgent

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:24,970
to make the activity in this project we

00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:29,050
collected more than 50 I began with

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,300
sweet on site and the the first the next

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,839
step is to implement this project in

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:41,139
other location now the city is another

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:44,649
sort of a fun afternoon so if you want

00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:49,839
to visualize this map here you can see

00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:53,589
the the clusters of i'ma grab them sites

00:09:49,839 --> 00:10:01,180
and you can see me and done start

00:09:53,589 --> 00:10:09,850

up gender divided in opposite mal

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:37,630
communities by Sun studies and training

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:41,290
girls and women in digital mapping today

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:43,959
we have more than 100 gas of change in

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:48,430
digital map in OpenStreetMap and free

00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:51,730
trials we have more than 8 countries who

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:55,089

of this projects organized drug and has

00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:04,600
a gas map camp in 20 in 2012 with more

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:08,189
active participant who have benefited

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:17,130

ESMA growing in activities double we

00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:22,470
with

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:29,170
the gas burner trends contribute to the

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:33,250
these tax and created for the purpose of

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:38,740
its merger with mapped on who organized

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:42,130

scientific names to to check the

00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:39,550
maturation like height after the trees

development municipalities refer prof

00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:14,960
digital mapping interval but also
