Today, nearly 17% of the global road network was last edited by a corporate data-team member. We further investigate unique editing patterns among three corporations that have specific, localized impacts on the map.

**Introduction** OpenStreetMap (OSM), the largest crowdsourced geographic database has garnered interest from corporations over the last four years. Today, major corporations including Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft have dedicated teams contributing to OSM. More than 2,300 OSM editors are associated with corporate data teams, up from approximately 1,000 in 2019 [1]. As of March 2020, nearly 17% of the global road network (measured per kilometer) was most recently edited by a corporate data-team member. Each corporation edits according to their own agenda; displaying unique patterns of edits with respect to types of features edited, mode (manual, import, or machine assisted), and locations and volume of edits.

**Aim** We investigate the unique editing patterns associated with three corporations: Grab, Digital Egypt, and Tesla, the latter two’s editing activity has never previously been quantified. Differing from other corporations with high volumes of global editing [1], these corporations exhibit uniquely specific patterns.

**Methodology** We use a combination of OSM data processing pipelines including tile-reduce, osm-qa-tiles, and osm-interaction tilesets [2] to extract and quantify the edits associated with the corporations.

**Results and Discussion** 

**Grab** is a Singapore-based company active in South-East Asia offering ride-hailing transport food delivery, and payment services. Grab is actively editing OSM data since 2018 and has thus far edited 1.6M features. Grab’s focus on transport related services implies that a navigable road network is a priority. However, topology and navigation restrictions are difficult to encode. Grab dedicates efforts to improve road navigability. In Singapore, Grab has edited over 100,000 turn restrictions, comprising 95% of all turn restrictions in Singapore (and 7% of all turn restrictions globally). This represents a highly focused effort put in by a corporation in a specific place to build infrastructure needed to support their business. Overall, Grab’s efforts of improving data and building a community of editors in South-East Asia is beneficial for the OSM ecosystem.

**Digital Egypt (DE)** aims to produce detailed and accurate GIS and Mapping data in Egypt, Middle East and Africa. Active in a part of the world with sparse geographic data coverage, Digital Egypt’s team of 24 mappers works to improve the accuracy of OSM, specifically as it relates to improving address information for improved geocoding in Egypt [3].

As of March 2020, DE has edited more than 2M features, more than 1.7M of these edits involve objects with address tags (e.g. addr:housenumber). These edits comprise 94% of the objects in Egypt that have an address tag. Similar to Grab, DE’s contributions improve the usability of OSM data for everyone. Unlike Grab, DE does not operate services built on top of this data infrastructure. Their hyperlocal focus and dedication to improving data for a country with a dearth of spatial data distinguishes them from other corporations using map data in a product.

**Tesla**—an American manufacturer of electric cars—was revealed to be using OSM parking aisle information for their vehicle’s self-driving “summon” feature in a blog post in November 2019 [4]. To function properly, the summon feature requires detailed maps of parking aisles within larger parking lots. These data were relatively sparse, as their utility to the overall map is minimal compared to the actual road network. However, the number of parking aisles added to OSM in North America has increased by approximately 71% in 2018-2020 from an average of 322 ways per day in 2016-2018. While there is no official Tesla data-team that is mapping these features, in the days following the blog post, the number of new OSM editors adding parking aisles within their first day of editing jumped from an average of 1.5 to 10.

A single blog post inspired dozens of Tesla fans to join OSM and add new parking aisles to the map, thereby mapping a specific feature type for a narrow purpose. These Tesla owners represent a new generation of hobby and “craft mappers” in OSM. Unlike traditional ‘craft-mappers’ considered to altruistically contribute map data about specific features, the Tesla mappers create data intended to be consumed by a corporation to enhance the experience for a select group of motorists. If looking to categorize these new mappers into prior community labels, their mapping practices have more in common with a “traditional craft-mapper” than a paid, corporate mapper.

Grab, Digital Egypt, and Tesla represent three distinct cases of corporations consuming, contributing, and dr

everyone my name is marco medina and i'm

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,809
very happy to be the chair of these very

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,640
last talk of the day for the academic

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,680
track not the last talk of the

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,740
conference but the last of the 10 talks

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,400
that the academic track scientific

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,410
committee was very happy to give you

00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,009
today of course thanks to all our

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:36,290
beautiful speakers and the speakers of

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:39,180
the next would be Jennings Anderson and

00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,329
dito Sarkar

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,770
so Jennings is geo information

00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,600
scientists working as a postdoc

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,480
researcher at the University of Colorado

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,850
Boulder he has been studying the

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,890
evolution of the ocean community and

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,620
building contributor centric

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,609
OpenStreetMap data analysis tools for

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:04,199
the past seven years then we have deep

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:06,030
talk he's a lecturer of geographic

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,880
information science at the University

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,159
College Cork in Ireland and he was also

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,070
interested in studying osm as a database

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,590
and a community both of which are

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,759
intrinsically linked and they will give

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,159
us a very interesting talk about titled

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,820
curious cases of corporations in

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,280
OpenStreetMap so I would now leave the

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,950
the floor to the today to the talk and

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,159
then we will be back here for the Q&A

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,710
session in the meantime I invite the

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,729
audience to just access the pad and ask

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,979
or write your questions during the the

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,649
talk and then we will ask those

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:53,700
questions to the authors afterwards so

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:54,990
enjoy the talk hello my name is Jennings

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,420
Anderson and today I will be presenting

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,939
our research title to curious cases of

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,680
corporations in OpenStreetMap this is

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,329
work done in collaboration with tip-toe

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,670
Sarkar so let's pick up where we left

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,289
off last year we presented our research

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,660
on the growing phenomenon of corporate

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,450
editors in osm this involved first

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,340
quantifying the

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,920
edit sponsored by these tent companies

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,959
now this is not an exhaustive list of

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,120
the corporations that employ osm editing

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,980
teams but at the time these tent

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,200
companies have publicly disclosed their

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,120
lists of paid editors and described

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,130
their editing activities there are

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,769
possibly many more but these are some of

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,599
the largest to date today we've also

00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:37,239
added three more companies to our

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:42,790
measures Digital Egypt Lite ciphers and

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:44,709
the ride-sharing company left over all

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,900
the scale of paid editing in OS M is

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,430
increasing this graph quantifies

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,720
corporate edits in the last five years

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:54,519
as of March 2020 17 percent of the

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,250
global road network as measured by

00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:02,920
kilometer was last edited by a member of

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:04,780
a corporate data team so how do we

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,750
quantify this editing activity in OS m

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,849
all of our data processing relies on the

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,709
tile reduce processing framework of map

00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:14,500
from map box which allows us to process

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:17,680
OS m in only minutes using a combination

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,079
of OS mqa tiles QA tiles plus a new

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,850
project OS m interactions which is built

00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:23,260
on the OS h DB project from the

00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,139
Heidelberg Institute for geo information

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,940
technology we search for specific types

00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,769
of edits to OS M elements and then

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,900
compare the metadata to lists of known

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,940
user IDs associated with each of these

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,560
corporate editing teams you learn more

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,720
about each of these tile sets at the

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,489
link shown on this slide the image on

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,440
the right shows an excerpt of the OSM

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:43,540
interactions tile set that contains the

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,760
editing history for every highway object

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,859
in OS m in this case this is a

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,299
screenshot in San Francisco and if you

00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,420
look closely there you can see many

00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:54,160
overlapping lines representing multiple

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:59,739
interactions by different users to

00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:01,900
specific highway objects so now that we

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,519
know how to quantify it let's look at

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,650
the geographic coverage of paid editing

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,989
activities so this represents the

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,310
aggregate of all 13 of the companies on

00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:16,599
the previous slides and between 2016

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:20,979
2017 and 2018 we see growing activity

00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:23,050
across most of the world and in 2019 the

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:25,330
global activity continues to increase

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,030
with these new editing hotspots in

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:31,150
various cities around the world

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,470
and this is how each company measures up

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,860
these are the numbers that were

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:39,430
presented last year and this is where

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:42,090
corporate editing is at today Apple is

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:46,349
currently doing the most work on the map

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:48,729
cart is just behind Apple and quantity

00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:50,379
Amazon's rate of editing is growing

00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,849
rapidly as their logistics team

00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:54,039
incorporates data from their delivery

00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:56,520
drivers they are acted primarily in

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:58,930
North America the nineth kingdom

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,699
facebook's editing team is everything at

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:05,289
a fairly consistent rate here with the

00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:07,780
slope of that red line and note that map

00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,580
box was the first page editing team but

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,930
has really plateaued in activity since

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,710
the other corporations have started to

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:16,360
edit digital Egypt has been very active

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,080
in the past year editing primarily in

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,819
Cairo and finally grab has also been

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,099
consistently editing over the past two

00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:28,090
years so this is the current state of

00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:30,400
corporate contributions to OS m today

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,800
however we're just gonna take a closer

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,750
look at the OS and related activities of

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:41,229
just these three companies grab active

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:44,080
primarily in Southeast Asia Digital

00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:46,839
Egypt active primarily in Egypt Cairo to

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,629
be more precise and lastly where we'll

00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:52,839
add another corporation to the list

00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:55,389
Tesla while Tesla may not directly

00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:57,250
employ a data team to edit the map we're

00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:01,810
gonna explore some interesting Tesla

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:04,330
related editing activity in late 2019 so

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,830
first grab grab is a Singapore based

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,469
company active in Southeast Asia

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:11,560
offering ride hailing transport food

00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:14,379
delivery and payment services grab is

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,210
actively editing osm data since 2018 and

00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:19,659
has thus far edited more than 1.6

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:21,849
million features and grabs focus on

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:25,860
transport related services implies that

00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:28,270
a navigable road network is a priority

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,330
road topology and navigation

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,860
restrictions are non-trivial to encode

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,009
we're talking of course about term

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,259
restrictions and OSM trim restrictions

00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,210
are relation elements that involve leh

00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:42,100
elements typically with the highway

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,630
and describe relevant routing

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,920
information between them such as no

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:49,120
right turn or right turn only etc so

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,750
let's look at some term restrictions

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,790
globally

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,220
these are visualizations from a project

00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,720
called QA tiles plus that are created by

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,400
extracting all the restrictions from

00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,110
Planet file and then putting them into

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,330
something that looks like an OS mqa

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,880
tiles format here's the term

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,860
restrictions present in San Francisco

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,840
and here's where there's turn

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:14,080
restrictions in London here's turn

00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:18,730
restrictions in Frankfurt Mexico City

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,830
and Rome now according to tag info there

00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:26,410
are 1.3 million relations with this

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:30,130
restriction key this is these are the

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:32,290
term restrictions in Singapore 7% of the

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:36,820
term restrictions globally are in

00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:39,160
Singapore and here's an animation of the

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,940
work that the grab team has been doing

00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,100
in the past two years the dots on the

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,380
map represent trend restrictions the

00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,410
greenways represent osm highway objects

00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:53,440
grab has edited over 100,000 turn

00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,180
restrictions in Singapore we choose to

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,770
highlight grabs OS and editing work

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,260
because it represents a highly focused

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:02,050
effort put in by a single corporation in

00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,760
a specific place to build infrastructure

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,790
needed to support their business

00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,680
directly in doing so Singapore is an

00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,420
incredible outlier in that density of

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,740
trim restrictions and we can only assume

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:17,230
that routing with osm data is then much

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,000
improved in Singapore overall however

00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,190
grabs efforts of improving this data

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,410
especially this complex rope topology

00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,940
and these restrictions and building a

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,520
community of editors in Southeast Asia

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,470
is beneficial far more than just to

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:35,170
their company but for the entire osm

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:36,340
ecosystem right when using that data the

00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:40,360
next company we'll look at more closely

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,860
as digital Egypt as of March 2020

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,960
digital Egypt has edited more than 2

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:49,090
million features in Egypt more than 1.7

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,500
million of these objects involve objects

00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,500
with the address tag

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,600
and these edits comprise 94% of the

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,040
objects in Egypt that have an address

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,510
tag so similar to grab digital Egypt

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,150
contributions are improving the

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:09,600
usability of osm data for everyone in

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:12,240
North Africa specifically geocoding and

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,360
place finding so here's the key map of

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,800
digital Egypt's editing activity and

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,570
here's a close-up of their work each

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,310
yellow dot represents a node with

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:28,400
addressing information and here's

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:30,930
another region and that's Cairo

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,550
so unlike grab digital Egypt does not

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,010
operate their own services such as

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,080
routing built on top of their data

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,030
infrastructure their hyperlocal focus

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,850
and dedication to improving data for a

00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,420
country with a dearth of spatial data

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,950
distinguishes them from other

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,350
corporations who are using the map

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:51,950
within a product by instead making the

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:55,610
local data the product itself the third

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:58,200
corporation of curious interest is Tesla

00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,970
test those an American manufacturer of

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,070
electric cars that was found to be using

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,030
osm parking oil information for their

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,860
vehicles self-driving summon feature

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:11,820
this information came to light in this

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:15,510
November 2019 blog post on the Tesla

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,310
Motors club website Tesla summoned

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,140
feature allows an owner to instruct

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,830
their vehicle to drive autonomously to

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,860
them

00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,330
through a parking lot one Tesla owner

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,370
witnessed their vehicle take the

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,500
Securities route around the parking lot

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,980
rather than driving directly to them at

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,860
the front of the store so they went to

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,560
osm they updated the parking aisles in

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,540
the map and returned to the lot to find

00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,010
that their Tesla had gotten smarter and

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,360
knew about these new parking aisles

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,430
therefore it was discovered that Tesla

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,730
must be ingesting osm data as part of

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:53,580
their routing and not just the primary

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:57,060
road network but that but these very

00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,650
specific parking aisles so for proper

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,960
functionality the summon feature

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:03,210
requires detailed maps of parking ions

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,460
within larger parking lots these data

00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,320
are relatively sparse as their utility

00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,300
to the overall map

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,050
is minimal compared to the actual road

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,570
network we found that the average number

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:18,050
of parking aisles added per day in North

00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:22,430
America increased by 71 percent between

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:31,940
the time frame of 2016 to 2018 and 2018

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:33,560
to 2020 so this blog post is partially

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,080
responsible for the overall increase in

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,700
interest in the days following this blog

00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,260
post the number of daily editor is

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,870
adding parking miles within their first

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:45,110
week of joining OSM spikes as shown here

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:47,150
in this figure similar to an increased

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,210
interest in osm following pokemons go

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:52,730
this single blog post inspired scores of

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,620
Tesla fans to join OSM and new parking

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:58,490
and add new parking isles to the map

00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:01,040
thereby mapping a very specific object

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,300
type for a very narrow purpose so we

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,990
like to think that these Tesla owners

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,690
represent a new generation of hobby and

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,310
craft mappers in osm unlike traditional

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,140
craft mapper is considered too

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,650
altruistic aliy contribute map data

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:17,270
about a specific feature the Tesla craft

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,880
mappers create data intended to be

00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,680
consumed by a corporation to enhance the

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,600
experience for select group of motorists

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,460
in looking to categorize these new

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,400
mappers into private community labels

00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,840
their mapping practices seem to us to

00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,850
have more in common with a traditional

00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,550
craft mapper than a paid corporate

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:39,020
mapper and this is why we think Tesla is

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:40,370
such a curious case so that concludes

00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,780
our investigation of these three

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,060
corporations and the influence they're

00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,980
currently having in a street map each of

00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,680
these companies is benefiting and/or

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,470
sponsoring the map mapping with very

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,910
specific features grabbed has mapped an

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,370
incredible number of term restrictions

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,610
in OSM and in turn increase the

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,140
usefulness of osm in southeast asia

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,390
digital egypt has added over a million

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,370
addresses in Egyptian cities massively

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:07,010
improving the geocoding abilities of osm

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,800
data in North Africa and finally while

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:12,110
Tesla may not be directing in sponsoring

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,270
these mappers their use of osm is

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,520
inspiring scores of mappers to sign up

00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:19,420
and add specific details to parking lots

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,210
again not unlike we saw with Pokemon

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,410
while we choose chose these particular

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,620
three cases because we had not

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,540
investigated them in depth before though

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,010
previous work and other presentations

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,870
have shown those corporations to be

00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,420
engaged in object specific everything in

00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,610
OSF so we thought it was good to dive

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,530
into these three to tell a deeper story

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,590
of what corporate involvement would look

00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,000
like in OSF

00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,010
this is in part to act as a reminder

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,900
that where the map fills in will always

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,760
tie back to a special or specific

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,770
interest whether that be a personal

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,900
interest a humanitarian interest or a

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,400
corporate interest we have no doubt that

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,930
the global community will continue to

00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,300
grapple with the interactions between

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,850
these many different user groups but at

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,040
the end of the day osm has been and

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,260
continues to be an incredible success in

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,650
terms of open Geographic data with great

00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,240
utility available to everyone well we

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,590
didn't highlight Amazon's editing in our

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,360
work we thought we'd share this

00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,370
Geographic summary of the nearly 1

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,620
million edits made since January by

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,090
Amazon logistics in North America which

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,970
we can only assume that dramatically

00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:24,340
improved OSF based routing again a very

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:28,240
specific type of osm data use in

00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:30,430
specific areas however let's go to the

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,830
different graph this shows the spike in

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:36,610
yet another community of mappers and OSF

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,260
that seen major growth recently this is

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,330
the number of mappers submitting change

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,990
sets about golf in the past two years

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:46,420
the spike in 2019 is likely related to a

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,810
popular golfing simulator using osm data

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,670
this looks pretty simple similar to both

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,370
the test the mappers and then interest

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:56,500
from Pokemon go players we end on this

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,930
graph to again reinforce the notion that

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,390
the OSM community continues to expand

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,090
and evolve as more people and companies

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:06,310
adopt OSM what might today be a curious

00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:09,510
case of osm data will soon become

00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:12,340
another sub community of LSM mappers

00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,900
thank you this work is supported by the

00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,160
University of Colorado Boulder the

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,560
United States National Science

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,270
Foundation with data processing support

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,110
from the chameleon cloud scientific

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,110
computing testbed

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:54,580
okay thanks a lot Jennings and deep toe

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,020
for these very interesting talk of

00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,380
course there are some questions

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,870
given the high interest that this work

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:05,020
generates just before going to the Q&A

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:07,600
session let me just say that we are

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,520
particularly happy to have Jennings in

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,250
particular here because Jennings I think

00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,650
is the only author who president within

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,010
the last which are all the three

00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:21,630
editions of the academia strong

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:25,030
2018-2019 in heidelberg and 20/20 online

00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:29,020
so I think Jennings you kind of want

00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:31,810
these this this this and let's say

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,540
competition like that so you are the

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,790
only one and particularly happy given

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,210
also the high interest of all your talks

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:42,520
not just of course this one but let's

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:47,110
come back to the past and let me just go

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:49,390
to the first question from Jian are you

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,839
sure the question is if from upper a

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:55,390
maps away incorporate mother B cut the

00:16:52,839 --> 00:17:01,020
way into do you count those with those

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:05,770
ways as created or last edited by A or B

00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:09,640
yeah that is a great question the answer

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:11,920
is it kind of it kind of depends and

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,959
that's part of the reason why we are

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,880
advocating for more of these these kind

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,650
of deep dive close investigations of

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,110
what's happening because I think we can

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:24,430
get a big picture from quantifying these

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:27,550
edits but to to get into the nitpicking

00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,070
of what happened with this object here

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,680
and this object that becomes a lot more

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,540
difficult to quantify kind of the hope

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,570
of some of this analysis is that by by

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,400
quantifying at a large scale we can get

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,900
a better idea of kind of where it's

00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,360
happening and what to what extent

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,210
whereas some of those very specific

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:50,950
edits are more difficult so the short

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:52,330
answer on that is that if counting it

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,950
depends on the data set that we're using

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,360
for that and we're kind of used multiple

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,890
data sets for different different pieces

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,050
of work here

00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:02,810
the osmq a tie

00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:06,290
we'll count that object as being last

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:09,080
edited by the corporate mapper and for

00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:12,710
that reason like that initial statistic

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:16,220
we give which is as of March 20 2017

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:19,160
percent of the global road network let's

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,160
quote last touched by a corporate editor

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,400
and that's kind of why we make that

00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:27,260
distinguishing attribute on that because

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,240
that is a difficult thing to measure now

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:33,070
that's the beauty of tools like the OS

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,360
HDB and things that we can better

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,850
reconstruct the full history OS sound

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,430
and so this is what the OSM interactions

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:45,080
tileset does which is built off of the

00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:47,210
OS HDB from from heidelberg that will

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,280
allow us to look closer at that

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,640
interaction which says okay this road

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,770
that was initially created by this

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,200
mapper and then corporate mapper came in

00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,090
and made an edit on that it wasn't a new

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,730
creation and so we can't get at the

00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,470
nuance of that so for the larger

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,940
statistics it doesn't just say the

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,850
corporate member did that because they

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,200
were the last ones to touch the way

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,150
however when we dive into some of these

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,530
things and we're looking at who created

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,090
objects or just trying to use more

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,610
specific language than we are

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:20,870
considering that full editing that full

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:22,550
editing history thanks a lot Jennings I

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,430
hope these answer the the question from

00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:28,220
Guillaume the second question was I

00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:30,050
think more about the concept and the

00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,550
definition of corporation that you would

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,500
you YouTube because there's a question

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,500
on hot the humanitarian OpenStreetMap

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,500
team that has done paid mapping in the

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:43,090
past and as employing people to do that

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:47,510
so why did you not look at that

00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:50,780
absolutely and so yeah this is something

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:54,500
I I should have included that slide in

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:56,090
in in in this talk but uh the way we've

00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,150
been kind of thinking about this now is

00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:03,530
like you know SM is this community of

00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:05,480
many communities at this point and no no

00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,920
mappers really fit that cleanly into any

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,530
single box and I think that's something

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,000
that we want to to kind of talk more

00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,980
about is as people are moving between

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,110
different organizations maybe

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,360
starts out as a hobby mapper through a

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,940
hot task and then end up being

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,230
eventually employed by another

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,049
organization and so people are kind of

00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,700
moving through this community and so we

00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,520
want to be really careful in how we just

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,580
start putting people in boxes when we

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,860
start kind of quantifying that and so

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:36,650
specifically what we were looking at in

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,000
in in this work was trying to focus on

00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,610
just those corporations to try to

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,470
identify these like specific what we're

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,210
calling is curious cases to people kind

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,059
of thinking about the impact this is

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,010
happening on the map overall in terms of

00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,690
the kind of corporations that we've been

00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,510
tracking and kind of watching this

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:56,240
growth those are the corporations that

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:58,760
we kind of started with and are trying

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,460
to find ways to now almost be more

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,660
inclusive and find better ways to

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,610
quantify the differences between

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,010
humanitarian and corporate but more just

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:11,270
like this overlap and this is all this

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:13,100
like kind of conflated mapping so that's

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,600
let's append wish you watch the answer

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:19,400
to that I want to be very careful not to

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,070
try to pit like corporate mappers

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,600
against hobbyists against humanitarians

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:27,799
I don't think that that's a constructive

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:31,040
dialogue of how the community is and how

00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:32,570
the map is being made and so I want to

00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,210
be careful that that we don't

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,620
necessarily do that and so yeah that's

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,320
kind of the answer is that it's all it's

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,970
all very interconnected and then trying

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,890
to figure out who is paid and who isn't

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:47,750
it it gets very difficult so this really

00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:49,640
heard lines to hard lines to draw thanks

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,429
Jennings I fully agree with your with

00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,860
your with your answer on this topic I

00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:57,740
just want to point everyone to were told

00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,900
that we had a couple of years ago in the

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,490
academic track titled evolution of

00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,890
humanitarian mapping within the

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,340
OpenStreetMap community who basically

00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:09,830
looked at the activity on the hot dusty

00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:12,080
manager and how these has grown over the

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,690
years so very interesting talk somehow

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,080
relates you to these questions let me go

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:20,330
to the next one that is from Andy Allen

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,820
asking with a grab Singapore editing are

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,370
all those restrictions actually

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,320
necessary

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,360
one common problem in the past is

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,550
companies adding unneeded the turn

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,040
restriction relations for example no

00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,380
writer earn into I know entry one-way

00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,720
road and then I will point you to the

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,300
pad just to have a look at the link so

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:47,170
for example from tagging for that

00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:48,910
I think Andy and added fascinating I'm

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:56,890
gonna bring up this link real real

00:22:48,910 --> 00:23:00,570
quickly here so this is it this is a

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:03,520
great question I think that there's uh I

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,930
think that probably the best the best

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,180
after that is going to be the grab team

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:11,380
I don't know much about what their how

00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,890
their kind of organizing matter what

00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,600
decisions that they're making I just

00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,160
well we're just trying to report on

00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,230
what's in the data which is that there's

00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,300
a lot of turn restrictions that they

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,970
have been responsible for and I'm

00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:27,610
assuming that since they're doing this

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,470
that the routing is improving in in

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,680
Singapore and that this is and this is

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:34,990
useful data to the math in that regard

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,200
I'm sure there's there's this is kind of

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:40,270
a yeah somebody from from a beers I will

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,860
follow up with someone at grab to learn

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:46,180
more about this because I think that

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:48,130
there is something to be discerned here

00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,450
between like turn restrictions in their

00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,940
various parts of the world and the

00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,950
usability of that and and how that and

00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,970
and how do outing works across the world

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,280
so I think that's maybe the more

00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:59,980
interesting conversation to come to come

00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,640
out of that so not entirely sure but I

00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,890
think that would be an interesting

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,540
conversation to to have with with the

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,330
grab folks to learn about what's what's

00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,310
happening on the map there so I think we

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:14,410
found it all before your next year stole

00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:16,660
good state of the map okay thanks for

00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:18,070
the for the answer and also thanks Andy

00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,500
for this interesting question of course

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:23,170
yes some sometimes it really it's a

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,450
matter of really asking or really try to

00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:28,300
go on the field actually if possible and

00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:30,520
and see why something is happening so

00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,950
next question is from Gregory and have

00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,310
you looked at the sides of mapping teams

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,540
per company and how that has changed

00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,779
rather than looking at the number of

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,799
edge

00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:43,869
we're company in question certainly and

00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:45,999
the short answer is that on these larger

00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:50,320
companies these teams are definitely

00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:52,169
growing in the past couple years as and

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,429
we're just getting that information by

00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:57,369
reading you know their wiki pages and

00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:59,979
the github pages for the data teams and

00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:02,469
what they're listing out and and as we

00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:04,570
track those user names as use users come

00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:07,840
kind of through these companies those

00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:09,549
lists are are generally growing and I

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,529
believe I believe now there's something

00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:16,419
in our in our list is maybe around 2000

00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:19,379
editors in total and and that was in

00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:22,299
like March so yes these teams are

00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:23,919
growing certainly in the larger company

00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:25,299
is I think some of the the smaller

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:31,359
companies I don't know the teams have

00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:33,549
been growing as as rapidly thanks

00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,830
Jennings and thanks also again Gregory

00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:38,289
for the question next one is from Cory

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,929
and the question is how likely do you

00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:45,070
think it is that these hyper niche

00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:47,019
markers I think this is about Tesla will

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,690
stay around to map more things outside

00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:51,759
of their narrow interests do you have

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:55,769
any data that shows they have any rates

00:25:51,759 --> 00:26:01,119
of retention that's a great follow-up

00:25:55,769 --> 00:26:03,849
question I don't have any any data so

00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:06,369
far that that would support that that

00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:07,749
would be oh yeah that would be kind of

00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:09,609
hard to measure but I think we could

00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:11,799
because we can't identify those those

00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,549
users that may be signed up and mapped a

00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:14,440
parking aisle

00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:16,119
immediately after the test the blog post

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,229
and and they're kind of an assumption

00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:19,690
about that and then look at their

00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:22,059
continued behavior I would imagine that

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,649
the rate of retention is fairly similar

00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:26,169
to the global community of someone who

00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:28,089
learns about SM signs up maps and and

00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:29,950
you know small percentage of them come

00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:31,330
back and and and and the majority of

00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,179
them don't and that's just internet

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:37,539
communities in general but that would be

00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:40,659
something to definitely dig dig more

00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:42,820
into some of that when I was just

00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:44,320
investigating like individual users on

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,879
on some of that work it was very

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,759
interesting to see that they they mapped

00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:51,050
of parking aisle and then they mapped

00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:53,780
the highway to

00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:55,700
to that parking lot and this is like in

00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,080
suburban Texas or something and then

00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,780
they also map their house and so they

00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,040
basically map their full route from like

00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,800
their house to like Home Depot or

00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,850
something and I don't know if they ended

00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,050
up coming back and keep your mapping

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,450
because I was doing this kind of right

00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:10,100
when it was happening so that's that's

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,900
interesting so they did they did and

00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,270
that more than just a parking isle but

00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,380
the parking aisle was kind of what

00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,190
started and then they started mapping

00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,929
this and they thought oh this is

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,360
interesting and I mapped their house in

00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,340
very critical detail and so I don't know

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,760
what that tells you about that as a as a

00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:28,420
mapper and then I'd like to just quickly

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:36,170
tiptoe just have a good a great comment

00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:38,270
that the AI with AI mapping the amount

00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,640
of mapping per mapper might be

00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:43,309
increasing as well with some of the

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,500
machine learning so back to the editing

00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:49,010
team size a smaller team will be able to

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,780
do more work utilizing with machine

00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:52,040
learning I don't know what those what

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,080
that might break down to but that is

00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,850
something that might change in terms of

00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,950
number of edits versus versus number of

00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:03,470
employees great thanks

00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:06,559
Jennings and again Cory for the question

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:09,020
next one is from Eugene some corporate

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,790
mappers are mapping part-time for a

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,309
company and also they do volunteer

00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:15,170
mapping on their own the change sets are

00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:17,660
generally differentiated by the presence

00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:19,820
of a change that ashtag if the map reuse

00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,130
is the same awesome user account and

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:27,890
again this is about your methodology so

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:30,620
take these into account in some ways and

00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:33,110
so some companies example cart that's

00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:37,220
that's a great example they will usually

00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:39,140
have hashtag cart or cart 2019 cart 2020

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:44,270
in the change that which is a great way

00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:47,990
to to distinguish that and there's also

00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:50,809
other companies that where they will

00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,550
have like underscore TeleNav at the end

00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:54,230
of a username for example to denote that

00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,790
that's their kind of corporate account

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,140
versus someone's personal account and

00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,419
then versus like someone's import

00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:03,330
account so that's another way that some

00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:05,610
of this these distinctions are made

00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:09,989
this current round of analysis does not

00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:15,210
account for users that are on corporate

00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:18,210
teams that you may do mapping in their

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:22,009
spare time not for a company it does not

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:24,330
account for them using or not using that

00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:29,190
hashtag but that is certainly something

00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:31,139
important to consider what the best of

00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,679
our ability when we see names coming off

00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:38,389
and on these lists of data team members

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:40,830
our users as they may move between

00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:42,629
different companies or get hired or

00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,369
leave a company and we try to you know

00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:46,080
attribute those edits to the appropriate

00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:47,789
company that's been the hardest part to

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,970
kind of track right now but I think a

00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:54,029
big part a big next part will be those

00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:55,289
users that that do both of that type of

00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:58,019
mapping and that's something to really

00:29:55,289 --> 00:30:00,210
highlight there that that user will

00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:02,639
ultimately will often get kind of lumped

00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,830
into this like into the corporate band

00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:07,499
when really that's not fair because

00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:09,419
they're also in these other in these in

00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:11,190
these other communities of mappers and

00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:13,559
so I think that that's another thing to

00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:15,539
highlight some of the nuance of of how

00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:17,700
we talk about this because these aren't

00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:19,019
just that's not just a corporate mapping

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,159
team no matter how someone feels about

00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:22,889
that at some point that's also like just

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,909
a community member and an editor and so

00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:26,879
I think that's these are important

00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:32,759
distinctions to to make and bring to

00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:35,970
light thanks a lot and let's go to the

00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:38,070
next one from used do you think it's

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:41,519
feasible to look at the displacement of

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:44,129
volunteer mappers questions like does a

00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:47,309
heavily corporate mapped area have a

00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:49,739
higher tendency to lose other mappers or

00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:52,230
do they shift their attention or does

00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:58,950
the hopefully increase data quality

00:30:52,230 --> 00:31:02,309
bring more people who are interested yes

00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:05,840
that is a great question

00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:08,179
that is something that I

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,690
we hinted at at the end of last year's

00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:12,890
talk and the answer is that that is

00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:17,330
something we really want to try to

00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:19,669
quantify a little bit more precisely

00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,900
before saying something like that

00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:23,150
because you can imagine that could be a

00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:26,419
very divisive statement within the

00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:28,850
community and we haven't been able to

00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:30,559
kind of say one way or the other we end

00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,510
up finding these kind of interesting

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,309
behaviors that we've been diving into

00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,950
and I think that that's because the

00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:39,860
answer to that is it totally depends on

00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:41,480
the location and the and the motivation

00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:44,690
for that mapping and and what's

00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:48,860
happening there and so I think that

00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:50,929
there are I think that's that's kind of

00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,370
the the the simplest answer to that is

00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:54,770
that that's just a very difficult thing

00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:57,440
to actually quantify it has potential to

00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,330
be kind of a divisive and harmful

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,770
narrative that could get kind of spun

00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,140
out of that and so we want to be really

00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,520
careful about how we measure that and

00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,740
make sure we're getting that right and I

00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:10,100
think the answer is it really depends on

00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,750
where and and if there is a community an

00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,480
established local community that might

00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:16,820
feel like they're being displaced we

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,100
could probably find instances of every

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,289
of all of this around the globe and

00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,630
that's why we haven't kind of come out

00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:25,700
inside one way or the other but that's

00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:27,980
definitely something for future work and

00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,140
if there's more collaborations or ideas

00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:33,110
around how we might quantify that or how

00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:36,649
we might kind of talk about that in a in

00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:37,850
a constructive way constructive for the

00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:40,130
whole community and the growth and

00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:44,140
quality of the map I'm all ears I do

00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:46,730
think that's a very important aspect

00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:49,970
thanks Jen exciting questions like these

00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:52,130
really show how interesting it is to

00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,679
study or send from a research point of

00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:57,649
view so thanks again I used also for the

00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:00,590
question and yeah much more to hopefully

00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:06,320
come in the future so the next question

00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:08,510
is from anonymous and team is about well

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,520
is there anything you are willing to say

00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:15,070
about Google on the topic of corporate

00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,070
mapping I know it might be not relevant

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,240
that's super interesting I have nothing

00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:26,740
to say or but I'm I'm not willing or not

00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:34,730
willing I don't know anything about

00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:36,529
Google in regards to this I I think this

00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:39,760
is relevant to a point and this is a

00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:45,409
comment that I kind of made I believe on

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:47,179
Frederick's talk yesterday that I think

00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:49,460
that I don't I don't know about Google's

00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:51,139
mapping approach or anything there but I

00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,730
think that this is on the topic of

00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:58,340
corporate mapping I think that there is

00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:00,470
you know we're seeing osm really filling

00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,480
in across the globe and at an increased

00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:07,060
rate and so in terms of relevance to

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:10,760
Google there are many places now perhaps

00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:13,310
emboldened by corporate mapping and now

00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,109
places with stricter validation or and

00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:19,339
just more eyes that have seen it that

00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:21,349
that osm is definitely a major rival in

00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:24,470
terms of a data source not as a product

00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:26,810
but as a data source to to what Google

00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:29,149
is able to do so I think that they're

00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:30,770
paying attention to this but that's

00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:33,379
that's kind of a lie

00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,790
all I know if anyone doesn't know more

00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:37,730
about Google and how they feel about all

00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:40,280
this or how how we internally as a

00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,399
community might measure up to their

00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,109
scale of mapping and what they're doing

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,780
who has better tools at this point our

00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:49,700
tools have gotten really really good so

00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,649
these are kind of some some great

00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,389
questions that I love to talk more about

00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:55,280
but I don't I don't I don't know

00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:59,960
anything about that so if people do

00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:02,089
would love to would love to talk yeah I

00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,670
think that would be really fertile

00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:07,460
ground for further research and

00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,330
discussion perhaps so next question is

00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,940
from Tobias

00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:12,920
do you have any statistics or sources on

00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,310
where the corporations paid markers are

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:21,340
based geographically hmm that's a great

00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:24,910
question no nothing

00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:26,410
say with with confidence I think we can

00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,740
make a lot of assumptions I believe that

00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:31,660
digitally JYP's work is a lot is is

00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,430
mostly based in Cairo based on where

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:38,620
they're editing and the knowledge that

00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:43,000
they seem to have other than that I

00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:44,940
guess I am not entirely sure other than

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,680
you know looking at these companies

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,110
websites and seeing like where they're

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,390
where they're where they're based but

00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,260
item I'm not I'm not sure on that I

00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:55,630
think that would be kind of interesting

00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,730
to to look at and if there's a

00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,920
correlation on regions of the world that

00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:01,150
are being mapped and but I'm not I'm not

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,010
sure without what that looks like that's

00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:08,470
a great question thanks a lot then we

00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:11,440
have the last question what about

00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:14,380
outsource mapping companies like global

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,770
logic and this is from Eugene mm-hmm

00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:20,170
yes that is that's a great question yeah

00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:24,610
we just haven't we haven't kind of

00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:26,650
caught up in our lists of of companies

00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:29,140
to be tracking like that because to our

00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,670
knowledge we haven't seen a list of the

00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,840
global lot you know we can only measure

00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,820
what we can find

00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:37,090
so we haven't seen a list of the global

00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:39,130
logic editors at the time when we

00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:41,320
started making our lists of corporations

00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:44,440
that we were tracking we focused on kind

00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:46,030
of the the the the top companies at that

00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,540
time and I've just kind of extended that

00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:51,640
work so if I'm just behind if we're just

00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,740
behind on I'm tracking these lists and

00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,890
there are more more lists of these of

00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:59,440
data team editors please point me in

00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:01,480
that direction and we'd love to kind of

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:07,180
add them so we can keep keep quantifying

00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:09,490
keep quantifying these thanks Jennings

00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,890
we have also a series of comments in the

00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,960
pad but given the time restrictions we

00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,270
have I propose that I would very quickly

00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,510
go through the comments and can you

00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:22,600
reply with just one very short sentence

00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:25,330
so we try to really be quick and go

00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:29,059
through these long yeah quite long list

00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:35,689
of comments so are you ready I'm ready

00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:38,390
Oh your room looks really cool here map

00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:40,549
data digitization companies to populate

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:44,869
or send for them periodically importing

00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:47,479
these data into their own platform yes I

00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:50,839
absolutely believe that difficult to

00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:52,939
kind of difficult to track but I think

00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:55,489
this is a fantastic mannequin this is an

00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:56,900
example of like all these new use cases

00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:59,719
of osm and how the data is being

00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,459
generated I think that's this this is

00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:03,650
what's been not even that new this is

00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:06,759
what's been happening for for a while

00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:10,759
and so yeah the more stories like this

00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:12,559
show the the nuances then we'll open map

00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:15,769
roulette challenge for Tesla parking

00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,839
guys super interesting I actually didn't

00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:20,269
come across that I wish I had earlier

00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,699
and I will look that up or someone can

00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:24,079
point me to that we'll take that into

00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:28,039
account because that's obviously going

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:32,329
to correlate then a comment about Tesla

00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:34,609
using GPS or I'm a jury let me just read

00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:36,289
the finer apart so all I know is with

00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:38,269
the main theory plus minus 5 meters

00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:40,519
offset any such mapping will just do

00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:42,650
more damage than good ok so they are

00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:44,719
certainly not using ID or cell phone GPS

00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:49,640
traces okay so ask them to share their

00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:51,619
secrets tools yes again highlighting

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:56,569
these very nuanced cases of these of

00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:58,519
these new pieces of tools and data

00:38:56,569 --> 00:39:00,799
that's coming into the community and I

00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:03,380
hope that prompts you know more

00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:05,779
conversations around how can we get all

00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:09,769
the best parking aisle information to

00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:10,669
know in Nova Sam great talk and so

00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:12,709
important to have this discussion

00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:14,150
looking to our own community the

00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:16,489
challenge for us could be to strengthen

00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,559
mappers editors and validators at all

00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:20,779
levels remote and local perhaps rather

00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:22,849
than lament and niche mapping of

00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:25,249
corporations let's take responsibility

00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:26,959
do our baits and find ways to benefit

00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:32,730
from all the communities in our Sam

00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:35,230
thanks any for this I love that

00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:43,839
well nice to see someone is presenting

00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:46,240
the three years in a row which is so

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:50,230
much potential or same should really get

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,540
on board with these researchers I feel

00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,890
like um everything this this research

00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,829
for a while that when I've been looking

00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,760
at this for at least the last two years

00:39:55,829 --> 00:40:00,730
specifically into this and I definitely

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,220
feel kind of very much on board and a

00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:05,250
part of the OSM community so I'm happy

00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,150
too happy to be here and doing this work

00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:11,430
I've become kind of passionate about

00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:13,540
this now so I think this is I love this

00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:16,809
thanks Jennings let me just add that

00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,880
there is actually a and osm science

00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:21,760
mailing list which is exactly a mailing

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,920
list for research or scientific

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,660
contributions around OpenStreetMap so I

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,460
would really invite everyone to join

00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,650
that mailing list and to ask questions

00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:32,230
because basically researchers and people

00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:34,780
like Jennings are there and would be

00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:37,510
very happy to engage in discussions

00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,829
around topics like this next comment

00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:41,319
don't let Google put their address

00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:42,880
database on the map else all my friends

00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:48,640
who will be sent to the wrong side of

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:50,339
town it's funny I like the PS there you

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,900
can't get a word in edgewise to Google

00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:57,369
yeah so that's that's what our sounds

00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:59,380
for her okay whatever we of wgs84 they

00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:01,359
are using will now become my sense due

00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,089
to their amount of edits so expect

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,790
everybody's craft edits will have to all

00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:12,369
move over to align with them so I sure

00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:15,280
hope they are not misaligned yeah

00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:16,930
interesting I'm saying all this

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,700
corporate editing is great if it is

00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:22,599
perfectly aligned okay as a follow up

00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:25,210
career and then again from I think the

00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:28,510
same user the same yes in person want

00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:30,369
OSN end up with tools of things wouldn't

00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:32,890
it be faster for companies to just add a

00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:34,750
new second road rather than check for an

00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:38,170
existing road and edit or at least the

00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:40,599
ladies first I don't necessarily think

00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,980
that's think that's true I don't know

00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,800
that it would be faster for companies

00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,920
just to add add roads

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,390
I think there's there's nothing not

00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,740
unique about how the company is my doing

00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,390
this might be doing it as opposed to any

00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,250
other mapper so I think that's more of a

00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:58,480
question of the tools and the abilities

00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:59,650
that we do have to to map I think yeah

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,850
that's kind of that's that's that's

00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,740
interesting I think there have been

00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:05,290
other talks at least it talks in the

00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:07,210
past that have talked about some of

00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:09,760
these validation efforts and and how to

00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:11,650
be more more robust in and how we go

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:18,100
about goes about that

00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:20,380
so it's interesting I think we completed

00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,869
all the comments that before saying

00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,510
bye-bye to everyone let me just share

00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:29,530
quickly my screen just to remind you all

00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:32,140
that the academic track also produce the

00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:35,230
proceedings which are the collection of

00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:38,020
abstracts on all the 10 talks that you

00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:39,610
have seen today in track two of the

00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,940
conference plus also an editorial

00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,680
written by the Scientific Committee you

00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,040
can very easily find the turns and

00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:51,190
although the name of the community's

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,890
salton 20 at 20 you can very easily find

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:57,250
online and it it's also linked from the

00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,660
from the website of the of the

00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:01,810
conference of course you will also find

00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:07,750
the abstract from Jennings and dicta

00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:09,490
that you have just seen as a talk last

00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,950
but not least I would like to close not

00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:14,980
just these talk but also the whole

00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:19,150
academic track at state of the month

00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:21,040
2020 with some thank you first of all I

00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:22,930
would like to thank all my colleagues of

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,140
the Scientific Committee of the academic

00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:30,160
track Sarina

00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:34,470
levente a Godwin ire and Peter for their

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:37,540
help in putting all of these together

00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:40,570
the conference the abstracts and the

00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:43,090
proceedings so thanks a lot because I

00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:46,810
mean we all know that there's a huge

00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:49,060
work behind these then thanks to all our

00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:51,190
beautiful speakers of the academic track

00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,869
Jennings deep Donald in the others

00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,060
because of course without them there

00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:58,040
wouldn't have been any academic track at

00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:00,350
all thanks to the state of the map work

00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,690
Groupon Christine first of all Martin

00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:06,440
and all the team and including the

00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:10,640
k-town local team and Burnell and all

00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:13,130
the others and last but not least really

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,160
thanks to the video team for providing

00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:18,800
us with a great infrastructure and

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,660
really you all deserve a big applause

00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,670
because without you that wouldn't have

00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:27,530
been any conference so thanks again from

00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:31,820
me I invite you now to have a break

00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:33,680
dinner break or lunch or any other kind

00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:38,630
of break depending on where you are and

I'll see you at 8 p.m. UTC time for a

00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:43,970
couple of more talks and then there will

00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:47,330
be the final session and osm quits and

00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:50,450
then the closing session from the state

00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:53,750

00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:58,930
attending and I will speak to you soon

00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:58,930
