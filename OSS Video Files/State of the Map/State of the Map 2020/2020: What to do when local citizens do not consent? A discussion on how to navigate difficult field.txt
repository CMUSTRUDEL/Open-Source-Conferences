Most field program managers have their go-to field preparation checklist - this often includes a data model, their preferred data collection tools, field survey timeline, to name a few. We are often cautioned about the importance of community entry, and it is right, you will not be able to just enter the community and start mapping as people will get curious, ask questions and possibly become suspicious or hesitant to accept your data collection activities. At HOT, we employe participatory mapping methods and encourage local people to map their communities. However, sometimes with even all the correct steps followed, your activities can be hindered due to factors outside of your control. In this session, we will explore one of HOT’s field mapping projects implemented in Kampala in collaboration with the Kampala Capital City Authority that aimed to map community-level flood risk in a local suburb along the Nakamiro Channel catchment area. Despite all the correct steps taken, community entry in a specific jurisdiction felt impossible and field mapping could not be carried out. In this session, our aim is to first discuss what went wrong and how our field team approached this situation and later invite participants/attendees to share similar challenges experienced in the field and how these situations were overcome or addressed.

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
field scenarios that involve local

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,520
communities

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,760
specifically drawing from hot's

for this talk we shall be talking about

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,159
what to do when local citizens do not

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,280
consent

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,000
especially for field programs when you

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,240
are in the field and you have a field

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,680
when you have a field mapping project

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,200
how exactly should you

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,600
should one go about uh

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,520
the citizens refusing basically people

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,920
are saying no you're not going to do

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,200
any data collection here because of such

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,799
and such a reason

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,840
you are not welcome for this

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,400
for this talk i i was hoping we would

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,280
have

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,040
more of a discussion around table

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,960
discussion

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,079
and i will go first i will talk about

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,479
uh our experience is in one of our

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,840
projects in kampala

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,200
which was the nakamira project i will

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,200
briefly talk about

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,920
i'll briefly talk about the nakamira

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,040
project what we were doing

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,759
where we were doing it and

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,479
we shall look at the challenges that we

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,239
faced

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,440
during this project especially around

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,200
local citizens not consenting we shall

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,680
look at

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,560
i will tell you guys some of the

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
concerns

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,640
that the people that refused had

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,400
and why they thought we wouldn't why

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,560
they did not let us do any data

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,000
collection there

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,959
and we shall also talk about what we

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
tried to do

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,000
to address this issue and how

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,200
we went about it and then we shall have

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,640
for the rest of the talk

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,519
hopefully i shall be hearing from other

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,920
people in the audience because i know

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,280
this is not only local to uganda it

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,599
happens

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,040
it's it's bound to happen in other field

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,159
projects around the world

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,760
so hopefully we shall hear from

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,840
other field managers or people who have

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,120
tried to do similar mapping activities

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,920
in their neighborhoods

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,480
and the different challenges that they

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,840
face

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,480
and how best they go about them so

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,640
the nakamiro china mapping project this

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,560
is a project that hot worked on

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,000
in collaboration with the kampala

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,680
capital city authority

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,959
and the world bank it is also

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,840
best of the open cities africa project

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,120
that was

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,080
that is under the open data for

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,720
resilience

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,599
initiative by the world bank this has

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,239
been done

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,840
across the open cities africa project

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,120
has been done

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
across over 11 countries if i'm not

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
mistaken

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,840
i know there's been a project in

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,360
there's been a project in kampala

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,400
there's been a project

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,400
in zanzibar there's been a project

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,879
in ghana in accra there's been a project

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,560
in monrovia and other cities across

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,319
africa

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,280
so this we with this for this project

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,799
basing off the gaba pilot which was uh

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,120
the project that we had

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,000
uh under the open cities africa

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,560
initiative

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,759
so with this we were mapping basically

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,160
to address

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,880
the flooding flooding in kampala

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,840
as we as we progress i'll show you some

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,520
of the pictures

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,360
from the areas that we were mapping

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,919
so with this for this for the camera

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,000
project

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,160
we were in a different part of kampala

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,199
not gaba

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,000
it's a place called kawempe and we were

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,120
mapping

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,960
five parishes that are around

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,840
the nakamira channel which is this

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,840
this one here

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,759
so uh you you might

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,720
you might wonder sometimes uh usually

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
the

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,479
some of the issues people can raise

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,680
maybe like you would think okay someone

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,800
would probably refuse

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,639
because uh you are collecting very

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,880
sensitive information

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,720
and well how are we going to use this

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,440
data in the first place

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,360
so i thought i would share with you what

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,320
we were actually with the features were

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,080
mapping and

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,280
maybe you will tell me if you think it's

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,720
actually sensitive information

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,039
so we were looking at

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,560
for this we were trying to collect

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,320
information that could be used by the

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,360
kampala capacity authority

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,600
towards supporting the resilience of

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,479
this community in kawampe and how best

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,520
to approach

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,600
the flooding so it rains heavily in

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,600
kampala and sometimes

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,080
these heavy rains are results into

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,000
situations like what you can see in that

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,080
picture on my left

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,639
over here where we see like a car

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,280
actually being taken away by water

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,680
so for this uh for this project we were

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,919
looking at collecting information

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,120
we collected information on the road

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,400
network

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,840
the road and drainage network in this

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,840
area we also looked at

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,479
the west disposal the waste disposal

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,520
points

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,960
in in this area we also

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,080
mapped public amenities like

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,759
places of worship schools

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,960
markets offices

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,680
public offices community halls and all

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,800
the different

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759
social amenities that are within this

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,319
area

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,800
this was to help us see okay to what

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,440
which

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,039
which facilities are affected first of

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,160
all we also

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,800
we also got information on

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,120
all the buildings within this area we

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,520
are gathering information like

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,039
what building materials were used to

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,120
construct this building

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,759
how high is this building um

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,199
what in what state is this building all

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,280
this information

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
would be very useful to the kampala

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,080
capture city authority

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,880
to better plan and see how best

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,759
to combat the flooding issues within cow

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,039
mp

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,120
so during the project hot

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,400
developed some information products that

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,919
were shared

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,840
that were to be shared with the

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,880
community and the kampala capital city

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,800
authority so

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,080
this is an example of one of the

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,919
products that was made

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,080
it's a map showing the building flood

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,120
risk of

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,319
yc3 parish

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,879
so what stands out most in this map is

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,639
the

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:51,520
gap that we have in the village called

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,919
san francis which i'm going to just show

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,759
you

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:59,039
here briefly this

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,599
so in so i'm going to just briefly talk

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,520
about

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,840
uh what happened in san francisco

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,960
weren't we actually able to map

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,560
so um the leaders in saint francis

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,080
basically told us

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,800
you're not going to map our area you

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,080
will map

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,039
other places but not this luckily enough

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,039
on our side

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,560
other leaders are the leaders of the

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,759
other villages

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,120
in our area of interest were welcoming

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,280
and

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,039
appreciated our efforts and were very

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,320
cooperative

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,880
so the main the main concerns that were

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,719
raised in this particular case

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,800
uh was the fact that we were working

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,080
with the city authority

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,279
which is well known for well

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,399
ensuring that um the city is well

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,640
governed

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,720
so in this particular area the kampala

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,519
capacity authority was already

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,880
conducting

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,320
a project around expansion

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,519
of the nakamira channel so some people

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,200
some of the people got us confused

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,959
got us mixed with the kampala

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,200
captaincity authority

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:13,200
some thought we were working for kcca

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:16,800
and we were merely just uh disguising as

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,160
kcca was disguising as hot to continue

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,320
uh evaluating and doing their work

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:27,040
so they thought that the data we were

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:30,320
collecting was going to be used by kcca

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,040
for other things like um

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,519
increasing their ground tax uh some

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,279
thought

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,040
they were going to be evacuated from

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,560
these places

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,519
others thought we were basically we

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,760
looked like

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,360
we looked like we were we were going to

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,040
be agents

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,040
very bad agents uh to them

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,920
so um some of what what we tried to do

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,480
to uh to address these issues and

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,640
concerns that they raised

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,920
we we had several meetings with them

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,880
explaining the project because this is

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,320
key they had to understand what exactly

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,399
we were going to do

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,880
and how this information was actually

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,320
going to be used

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,519
um so we had a focus group discussions

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,040
with them

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,640
shared uh everything they everything

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,160
literally that they needed to know about

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,920
the project

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,880
um another thing that we did was

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,440
showcasing successful projects we talked

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,079
about

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,920
the gaba pilot that had happened under

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,959
the open cities project

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,360
because they were these these com both

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,240
these communities are essentially the

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,920
same

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,519
they are both affected by flooding and

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,680
and we thought it would we thought this

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,320
would this was actually the best case

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,360
scenario basically study to showcase to

00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,079
the

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,880
to the kawampe team to the san francisco

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,120
we also carried out community

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,839
sensitization

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,360
inside in a way that we involved we

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,160
involved the leaders

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,959
in some of the in some of the work what

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,399
prides itself in community

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,360
in participatory mapping so we had the

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,360
community

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,880
leaders and some of the community

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,720
members get involved

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,680
in a participatory mapping exercise

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,360
while we were able to together with them

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,680
were able to establish

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,800
which areas i usually experience

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,440
flooding

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,720
over the last 10 years and how deep this

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,920
water was

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,560
this exercise was also mostly

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,920
mainly to involve them that you actually

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,120
understand

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,120
are the main effects and the main push

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,360
for the project and the work we're

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,079
actually doing

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,800
and maybe the other thing the last thing

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,440
to

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,320
talk about and what we did we tried to

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,760
we tried to

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,519
stay out of any um

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,600
any of the any of the uh

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,680
i honestly call it drama any of the

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,880
drama that was coming up because uh

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,040
for instance maybe like there were some

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:25,360
cases coming in as more of a political

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,560
issue so we we tried our level best

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,839
we tried our best to maintain a neutral

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,680
ground

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,320
and explain ourselves uh which

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,320
which still fell on deaf ears because at

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,680
the end of the day

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,480
they still didn't let us map which we

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,240
were

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,480
which one which we which we tried to

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,160
and we tried to let it go we basically

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,680
let it go and

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,120
map the places well welcome

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,680
yeah so the main the main

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,240
uh issue of sharing this is because i

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,000
know i know this could be important for

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,560
any other person planning a field

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,440
mapping project and

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,040
yeah it helps to know that this it helps

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,240
you to know that this is something that

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,279
could actually happen to you in the

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,160
field

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,519
and i hope this will help you prepare

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,240
yourself

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,480
and know what to do in case this arises

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,279
i added some resources in the talk

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,560
that could help other field program

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,760
managers

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,920
and anyone planning field work so

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,880
there is this toolkit that was developed

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,320
by hot

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,800
much as it's for refugee

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,959
it's for a refugee context i believe it

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,079
can still be applied in other

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,959
areas that require field mapping because

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,399
most of the steps laid out in this are

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,000
really what you'll need

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,560
to carry out your field mapping exercise

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,600
so for the next few minutes we have for

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,920
the talk

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,240
i'd like to hear from you if you first

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,160
the similar challenge before

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,040
uh what were some of the concerns that

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,639
were raised by the community members

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,800
and how did you go about it maybe also

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,760
i think as a community we need to think

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,880
how best

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,720
could we approach uh such scenarios

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,399
maybe could we be doing more data

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,120
literacy campaigns

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,320
or talking more about open data in the

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,800
first place

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,880
people should people should not uh you

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,880
know be scared of our mapping

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,199
initiatives

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,199
yeah thank you so much

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:45,839
live thank you very much for that

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,839
uh very interesting presentation um

00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:01,760
how did you identify

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,760
who the community leaders were

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,120
so the community leaders like the the

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,040
leadership structure

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,480
the administrative literature structure

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,920
in uganda so we

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,760
we have the mayors and then the

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,160
village councillors so we went to those

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,959
leaders like the legally elected leaders

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,000
of those communities

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,920
um you mentioned that there was some

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,199
distrust

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,639
of the city authorities did you think

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,920
that working with the city

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,120
authorities helped or hurt your attempts

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,560
to get trust from

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,560
the people in the community

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,839
so i we had to work with the city

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,600
authority because this was supposed to

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,639
be a collaborative project

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,720
uh so i do not think it had

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,639
these were all really personal issues

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,079
raised by the community members so we

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,680
couldn't have known

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,360
whether with or without the kampala

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,639
capture city authority they would be

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,639
responsible not

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:08,320
um were there

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,399
features that the community felt

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,000
were more sensitive than others like the

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,320
people in the community who were

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,399
concerned

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,759
uh me i think one feature would have

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,440
been the status

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,279
of the buildings because we are mapping

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,680
to assist the building risk

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,199
to flooding so and then there was

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,959
expansion going on so some people were

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,839
thinking okay if you say my house is in

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,000
a

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,000
poor state does that mean i'm going to

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,839
be evacuated or not

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,880
yeah so i guess that's it for the

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,639
buildings

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,040
um were there

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,160
situations are there situations where i

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,480
think generally

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,000
perhaps not specific to kampala but

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,040
generally

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,079
where you feel that

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:58,720
it's better to not map an area

00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:01,040
because possibly actors officials either

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,399
city officials or other people could use

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,319
the published data

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,319
against the local population

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,400
i am not so certain of that but

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,480
i think at the end of it this i was

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,760
actually asking do we need to be talking

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,880
more about

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,720
open data policies and how

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,000
this information is actually used so

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,600
that's why i just shared

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,559
um about what we did to approach this

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,679
case and this

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,840
to approach this scenario and

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,600
also hope to hear from other people what

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,720
like they think can actually be done in

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,160
such scenarios

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,280
and yeah learn from each other yeah

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,160
um i'd love to

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,240
see what others have uh what local

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,919
experiences others have

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,480
um do the other two

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,559
who are um marcel and edie do they have

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,480
anything to add to that

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,840
yes yes they do i think

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,840
ed can go first

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,720
hello everyone uh is xiaomi introduced

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,520
me my name is edith azuwa

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,080
i'm basically from tanzania uh i always

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
seem

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,080
a job in tanzania but working with rock

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,120
organization called open map level

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,240
tanzania

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,120
uh but also executing a hot project here

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,120
in tanzania

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,480
so all the data collection and

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,120
everything switching uh

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,000
require field work for tanzania teams uh

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,480
we are responsible

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,160
we are we are responsible for it okay so

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,720
for the case of camilla which

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,679
uh she was talking like we had a couple

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,240
of uh

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,000
cases here in tanzania whereby we go to

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,120
data collection and we find

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,320
a local people they go against what we

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,840
we like what we expected to do and based

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,880
on our experience

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,840
so we have uh major two uh reason which

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,320
uh uh led to that like the cases which

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,360
we

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,160
experienced so uh first one i can i can

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,760
put it as

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,799
political uh reasons whereby like

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,280
uh due to political reason you can go to

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,840
a

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,000
certain area to collective information

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,600
and you can find that that area

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,880
is under certain political uh reader

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,200
leader so when you go with your ambition

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,080
of

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,799
data collection they may think maybe you

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,880
come

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,080
for the political reason maybe maybe you

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,480
want to count people

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,400
something that so in a situation like

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,000
this you can find that people are

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,840
rejecting what

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,360
uh what you want to do but in your case

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,799
to to dissolve this situation

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,600
uh face what we we usually do is to

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,840
elaborate in detail in making sure that

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,600
we address the concern of the people

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,400
like what what the reason like

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,080
those people think we are there for so

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,280
we need to know like the exact racing

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,160
what is the motivation

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,520
motivated factor led them to think that

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,400
we are for that

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,520
things which they are thinking as we are

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,720
there for

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,799
and also uh to make sure that we

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,039
are we are following the uh like

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,159
we are going with local readers the

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,840
people who are

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,679
like the leaders who are responsible for

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,200
that specifically

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,200
for example in tanzania we have

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,559
different level of leadership

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,280
and the main the main which matter most

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,400
is

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,240
the local leadership whereby like for

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,919
example we have a chairman

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,840
like the person uh who's a leader who

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,280
has been elected by local people of that

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,720
specific area

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,000
so by by like by making them

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,120
understanding what we aim to do and

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,520
like be familiar with whatever we have

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,880
to

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,320
in the area that this uh helped us

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,200
to like everybody to say that this

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,679
question

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,720
also another things happened uh when

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,360
people think

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,000
uh maybe uh they need to be evacuated

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,360
for example

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,919
we are doing a flood mapping uh also we

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,159
are doing

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,200
uh drone data collection and in that

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,520
room we are using

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,360
a ground control point so we are

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,559
measuring the ground control point

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,919
uh nearby liver areas and some of those

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,360
ground control points

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:24,880
they are nearby people's land or in

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,440
people's land and so when we are going

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
to take

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,440
measurement where when we are going to

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,679
surveying those ground control points

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,520
because it's nearby the uh river and

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,520
there's the rule that you are not

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,320
allowed to build a house

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,919
like six within six meters of the river

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,919
so when we are surveying those

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,960
ground control paint and some of the

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,520
people's

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,799
land and some of the people's houses are

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,000
within 60 meters

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,000
of the river

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,840
so the direct thing that we have

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,640
something to do with the housing

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,679
we have something to do is like removing

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,799
those people in

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:07,840
those areas so again the same procedure

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,000
we we like

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,400
the same procedure like as we did before

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,200
like is to make sure like

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,240
uh we understand their concern like what

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,159
is the motivation

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,520
factor what is the motivation thing led

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,480
them to think that

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,080
we want i had to evacuate or to remove

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,640
them from their area

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,080
so after understanding that then it's

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,120
easy to uh

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,480
explain to them in detail like what

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,679
we are doing uh in relationship of what

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,640
they are thinking

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,520
and also again a locality a very

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,039
important

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:46,400
thing like a very important uh to so

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:49,120
to to solve this situation and

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,760
as i said before we have different rank

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,320
of

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,360
government but we have municipal we have

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,240
a city but

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,799
for this case the people who they trust

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,280
the most

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,080
they are local leaders so we have to

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,320
make sure that

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,120
we make the local leader understanding

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,480
well

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,919
what we want to do and from there it's

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,919
easy to

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:14,880
pursue the local people in those areas

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,440
and yeah in the good news at the end of

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,400
the time

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,240
all the cases we managed to collect data

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,480
and we managed to

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,320
elaborate in detail what we are doing

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,400
and the local people and the

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,600
local uh people in those areas

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,280
understanding us

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,880
what we are doing and yeah everything's

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:39,679
end well so that should

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,679
have experienced from tanzania

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,600
thank you eddie uh myself

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,840
i can hear from myself some similar

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,760
experiences from

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,760
congo hello

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,440
this is

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,960
hello this is marcel chabani from congo

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,320
as shamila introduced me

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,440
uh i'm from congo democratic republic of

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,480
congo

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,880
and uh on data collection as we have

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,080
been

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,520
working we we face many challenges

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,080
as uh shamilah mentioned and in this

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,720
side

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,200
as everyone know uh the democratic

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,159
republic of congo especially the eastern

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,679
congo

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:32,799
have been improved uh a lot of

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:36,159
war and into that uh

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:39,200
it's still like the community are like

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,279
not really believe on uh

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,799
the process of data collection into

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,480
their community

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:49,760
so sometimes the big issues it's about

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,559
uh the the sensitive information we we

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,360
we are collecting and uh on these

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,679
challenges

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,200
what we have been going through and what

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,720
we have been doing

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,440
we we had first to if we connected the

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,960
data

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,480
into a real area we had

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,679
to contact the king

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,400
in this side of the

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,039
the muammi we have to talk to him so

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,480
that

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:21,440
he can introduce us

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,320
in fact because if we just come and go

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,320
into the

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:30,080
the community the community wants

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,480
wants letters uh in because they will

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,960
think

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,520
always think that there is something

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,640
behind that data collection as

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,360
these uh areas have been uh

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,240
going through a lot of problem uh in

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,039
security

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,159
and these people think that every time

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,640
people coming into

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,760
their community collecting data they

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,279
think that

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,919
these people are like uh participating

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,279
in their community that insecurity into

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,000
their community

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,600
and the truth that we have to talk to

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,559
the king

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,480
if the king gave us allow us to to go

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,440
into the community

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,200
we go now and talk to the community and

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,320
when talking to the community all the

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,120
community always

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,679
ask what they're going to benefit

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,559
because

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,720
sometime you know you can't go you're

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,159
going into the aero areas

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,400
where people doesn't know about

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,039
technology they will always

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,840
have many questions how does this

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,000
collection

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,360
will bring us like peace because they

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,760
say people always

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,760
talk about peace so

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,640
we with this one we always think to

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,480
talk fast to going through

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,640
administrative levels

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,440
by the king going talk to the king and

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,799
after these steps we can go through the

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,000
community as this

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:56,720
is still the the red area

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,320
and with this uh going far into the

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,960
community it's always a

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,000
always and it's still difficult to

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,360
collect data

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,840
in such in eastern drc like

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,960
as we are facing a lot of issues a lot

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,120
of problem

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,120
due to insecurity this side

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,200
and when collecting the sensitive

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,159
information we always explain to the

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,799
community

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,840
what are going what we are going we are

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,480
coming through

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,200
and as in the community i've been like

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,080
abandoned

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,679
in their own faith do not directly see

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,520
the importance of

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:46,240
data collect or

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,240
seeing the impacts into into their

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
community

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,440
um and i think related to

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,880
sorry go ahead marcel

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,679
yes and i was saying as it's still

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,679
difficult

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,919
i was saying as it's still difficult

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,039
even with all the best way where

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,640
we have trying to to collect data

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:20,159
into this community it's always a

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,960
nice idea to take time as it can take

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,000
like

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,279
more than one one month because we are

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,919
first to get

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,480
go into the process of like involving

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,600
the

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:35,919
the local communities and uh

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,919
showing them what is the data

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,440
collections

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,399
yes that that's cool um so related to

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,600
uh what marcel was just saying we have a

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:59,840
couple of comments

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,840
um from uh

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,840
um

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,760
another issue raised is that

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,600
oftentimes the buildings being surveyed

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,200
do not have permits

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,919
so um the locals are concerned that the

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,799
buildings

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,600
uh can't legally exist so they don't

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,760
want them

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,880
mapped so they don't want them to show

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,399
up as existing

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,399
on any official maps

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:46,000
and uh also uh

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,039
a comment that because the data is open

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,399
data

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,120
uh even though

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,880
um the group mapping even when the group

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,360
mapping is not officially

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,480
affiliated with the city the city is

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,919
likely to start

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:05,279
using that data once it is mapped so

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,720
from the local perspective it looks like

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,440
um it is the city because it then they

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,880
see it

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,600
um they see the city using it uh

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,600
soon after

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,919
um so a question uh for the three of you

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:27,919
is um would

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:31,120
any sort of papers or documentation

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,919
help or hinder your efforts

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,919
to map

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,440
so i'll answer that uh i believe

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,760
documentation

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,760
usually helps because it helps you to

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,000
know like when you're going to an area

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,200
people who can clearly see who you are

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,120
and what you're working

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,120
who you're working for and what you're

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,840
actually going to be doing we always do

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,840
this as hot

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,440
yes so i believe it will actually help

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,760
you instead of it will not hinder you in

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,760
any way

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:18,240
um have you heard that a certain

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:21,519
presentation um or

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,880
you what what specific uh do do you

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:28,159
give like out flyers do you

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,039
um do a

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,120
a cow meeting what what what do you find

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,440
helps

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,240
we always have we always do town

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,240
meetings

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,840
we always meet with the leaders before

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,200
the projects

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,559
and have presentations with both the

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,320
people that we are going to be using in

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,519
the data collection process where the

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,760
mappers

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,279
and the community members themselves and

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,440
tell them about the project

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,960
tell them what you're going to be doing

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,640
like i mentioned in the slides you even

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,600
usually have participatory mapping

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,200
exercises

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,919
with the community

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,919
uh do you

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,120
do you carry any sort of information

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,240
with you um

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,279
badges or anything like that yes

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,760
yes we do carry those uh we even usually

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,320
have

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,960
like laters authoritative letters from

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,480
government

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,559
or like the government organization that

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,399
we're working with

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,000
detailing the projects and which we

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:30,640
present to the leaders

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,679
the community members yeah because you

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,919
cannot just show up

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,799
you can't just show up without any of

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,799
this information

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,240
um edie marcel uh do you have the same

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,240
experience

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,000
uh yeah also in now and uh we usually

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,120
have

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,600
uh renters like uh because

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,200
the permissions start from at the uh

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,039
minister level like you need the

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,559
permission from the ministry

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,320
you need the permission from the

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,120
regional level

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,320
so for in data collection what you go is

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,679
with those permission

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,559

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,440
in democratic republic of congo we have

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,560
to go

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,520
through a big process because it's

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,760
always it take

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,720
long to get the approval from the

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,320
government

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,280
we have to from the national

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,480
administration level and then we have to

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,040
go to the governor

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,480
after the governor the the

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,119
administrative level

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,920
we have to go now to those we call that

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,680
the king

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,400
of the community and that's into giving

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,680
that

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,839
the first one it's always a we have

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,440
we always have to talk to the king

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,920
because when the king

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,960
is like older to the community no one

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,480
can can

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:30,000
can refuse or to execute his order and

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:33,040
even with that also in those red areas

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,400
like where they have been

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,760
through many years into war

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:43,200
it's always difficult to to get even

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,160
even if they have like all the the

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,040
approval to to collect the data it's

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,079
always

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,200
hard to convince that the community that

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,440
what we are we are trying to do will

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,119
help you or will solve this all that

00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,240
problem but people always

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,880
think about like peace and it's it's

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,960
still

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:08,560
like one of the big issues they say but

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,280
meeting with luck is one of like the the

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,240
the the best way to talk to me to the

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,560
community

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,359
and to give them to to get their

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,839
approval

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,880
so that we can collect data and with

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,920
that

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,800
they always ask to get their community

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,200
involved

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,240
and if we get their community involved

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,079
or their

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,160
their member the community member

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,359
involved we have now

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,720
the possibility of data

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:40,079
and with those members they will be like

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,640
the one between have in their

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,599
community and trying to to fix the

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,320
problem or

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,320
any issues

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,079
um a follow-up question for you marcel

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,960
um in the democratic republic of congo

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,000
um

00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,119
are uh artisan or

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,520
illegal lithium mines a factor in

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:08,640
people not wanting an area to be mapped

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,640
yes yes there is

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,560
let's look for let's take for example

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,839
the venue

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:21,280
or let's take for example

00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:25,119
like the ituri territory where

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,240
people where a new project is going to

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,200
start

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,520
people having all those issues about

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,400
people coming collecting data

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,760
because they already think or seeing

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,920
something behind

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,960
which is like behind that data

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,040
collection

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,040
and as the community itself is seeing

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,400
everyone coming into their community

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,440
with a bad eye

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,760
like this one is one of like the rebels

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,720
or

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,440
is one of who is coming to destabilize

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,839
our

00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,800
our community and it's one of luck the

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:04,640
big issue they said

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:08,160
um a question uh

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:11,520
for shamila um is it uh

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,760
possible to go back to the community

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,960
with members of uh other nearby parishes

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,800
to help convince the the

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,800
community that was most reluctant

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,839
uh yes yes it is we actually tried to

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,400
use that method as well actually at the

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,960
end

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,480
at the end the saint francis members did

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,839
accept cause but then

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,520
during this the time when we actually

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,440
had finished the project

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,040
we're already returning with some of the

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,720
products the information products that

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,560
promise the village members

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,640
and during the we usually have like a

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,160
community like exit exercise where we

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,200
are sharing the information that we

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,160
picked

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,520
and um looking at looking at the maps

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,800
and understanding the information that

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,240
was gathered

00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,839
and this is when the saint francis

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,640
leaders were like oh you can actually

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,800
come back and do the data collection

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:11,839
yeah so yeah i believe they will

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,839
actually also help as well

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,480
so it sounds like uh that

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,119
you have to put in a lot of preparatory

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,839
effort

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,800
um before you can actually do the

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,040
mapping

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,079
uh do you find that the the preparatory

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,800
effort um

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,599
and the persuasion takes longer than the

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,599
mapping itself

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,280
uh in in some in some cases it does

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,560
and i believe it's actually it's

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,280
actually important

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,200
however long it takes it's very crucial

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,720
that the community understands what

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,480
you're trying to do

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,319
it may delay your project at the end of

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,520
the day but it's very important

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,520
so yes

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,440
all right i think our questions

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,960
um i think we're just a few minutes from

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,079
when the next session is supposed to

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,280
begin

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,359
okay so thank you very much uh

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,119
for your presentation and for joining us

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,040
um if you have any

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,440
closing thoughts

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,880
um i believe uh maybe i would like to

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
just share that we can actually continue

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,200
this

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,200
discussion on the different social

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,920
platforms that are available because i

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,000
believe

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,680
it's very it's a it's an important

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,079
discussion to have

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,160
