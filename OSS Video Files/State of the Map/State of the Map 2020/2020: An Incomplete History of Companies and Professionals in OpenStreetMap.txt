This talk with survey the bright and dark history of companies and professional involvement in OpenStreetMap, lay out the challenges that we face now, and chart steps forward to figuring this out together. I want to reset the vision of the position of companies in OSM, starting by connecting back in time to when it was all more fluid in our community. Only later did some draw a sharp distinction between volunteer and professional activities in our project. The reality of the relationship of companies and professionals in OpenStreetMap from the very earliest days until today is ... complicated. There's incredible mutual benefit and purpose. There are super hard issues to address when large amounts of resources are mustered, among the constellation of many kinds of actors and motivations in OpenStreetMap. The reality is that OpenStreetMap is transformative, and that companies in OSM first come for the data, may fumble along the way, and stay for the shared mission to change how maps are made in the open.

I want to reset the vision of companies place in OSM, starting by connecting back in time to when it was all more fluid in our community. For example, a month after I met Steve Coast in 2005, I was setting up meetings with Google. Helped secure Yahoo! maps imagery in 2007. Companies hosted many of the early days mapping parties. Professional cartographers were among the projects most original enthusiasts. The point was to change how mapping was done -- including and especially at companies. 

Only later did some draw a sharp distinction between volunteer and professional activities in our project. The reality of the relationship of companies and professionals in OpenStreetMap from the very earliest days until today is ... complicated. There's incredible mutual benefit and purpose.  There are super hard issues to address when large amounts of resources are mustered, among the constellation of many kinds of actors and motivations in OpenStreetMap, whether they be hobbyists, developers, students, researchers, non-profits and on and on. The reality is that OpenStreetMap is transformative, and that companies in OSM first come for the data, then stay for the mission. There are of course fumbles along the way.

But as a community we've lacked a way to take a clear eyed view of the challenges and vital role companies and professionals have played in what OSM has become today. In part that fault lies with companies themselves, who are risk averse to delving into our wild and wooly communications. Those that do, can take a lot of heat.

This talk with survey the bright and dark history of companies and professional involvement in OpenStreetMap, lay out the challenges that we face now, and chart steps forward to figuring this out together.

are just kidding it's me it's mikael i'm

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,920

not a corporate sellout come on you know

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,159
me

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,880
mikel from openstreetmap i get out of my

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,159
just home from the office sorry let me

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,759
get out of this

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:35,040
oh man you know our day at work

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,040
making the big bucks

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,360
and come home and spend some time on

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,840
open street map

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,840
all right

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
how's it going everybody

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,240
it's my talk in complete history of

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,960
companies and professionals in

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,960
openstreetmap

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,960
and uh i'll be honest with you

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,360
you know i have some objectives here

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,879
i think a lot of what i hear what we

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,319
hear in the narrative about companies

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,760
and openstreetmap

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,599
it's got things a bit wrong especially

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000
in the history especially in the um i

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,800
think

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,080
much more blurry and gray area of the

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,480
early days

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,560
and so in part i'm hoping to reset the

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,160
narrative a bit

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,520
and um help to like define what

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,200
what is the productive relationship

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,680
between open street mapping companies

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,680
and

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,120
not let them off the hook not let the

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,319
off the hook i

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
am going to say a lot of nice things

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,840
about companies

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,319
but there are a lot of big issues

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,959
and we need to find a space to fix

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,920
what's broken

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,200
but first of all you know since the very

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,480
start companies have been

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,120
integral part of openstreetmap and

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,120
i don't think the line between you know

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,159
the volunteer and the professional was

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,840
was very clear from the start

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,519
this is steve cost this is steve cost

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,800
speaking at the first state of the map

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,280
in manchester

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,280
in 2007 if you saw any of the early

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,400
talks by steve you'd recognize slides

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,800
like this

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,560
uh he's explaining him the the pressure

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,280
that openstreetmap exerts on

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,080
the geodata market um and that's you

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,560
know

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,599
really how steve was positioning it

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,040
thinking about it as

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,560
the quality of openstream map at

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,879
a free price as the quality increases it

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,640
puts downward pressure on the price of

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,640
proprietary data

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,159
associate framing was within you know

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,200
within the uh

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,200
company market based landscape

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,879
you know steve put it very you know

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,239
distinctly um thinking about like the

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,959
role of osm is

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,000
there's a pathway forward you know um on

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,720
the one hand

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,280
be an open map be a be a product that

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,080
like

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,760
everyone could could really use an open

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,799
version of google maps

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,799
or a socialist utopia where

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,239
focus is on on the guts of data

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,120
and everyone can make their own map and

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,320
i mean i think this is uh the reality

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,919
has become much more

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,959
complicated um but the the tensions and

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,000
the you know that

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,320
that question of like where

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,440
openstreetmap lies was always is always

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,880
blurry it was always

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,479
um you know is this a binary choice

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,479
as it turns out not not at all

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,400
this map um you may recognize as

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,000
the poster that tom carden and steve

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,759
coast produced

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,440
in the early days of openstreetmap it

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,400
was the first image i saw of openstream

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,919
app at a talk

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,800
in 2005. um it is aggregating

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,280
all the gps traces of london from that

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,240
time

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,160
and it was so convincing that this idea

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,199
of everyone walking around with a gps

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
unit

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,600
could map the world here's a map it's

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,720
recognizably a map of london just from

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,759
gps traces maybe this really is possible

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,520
and guess what

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,880
most of the data that you see here came

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,120
from a private company

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,400
called e-courier which donated a huge

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,440
amount of

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,600
its gps data from its drivers that was

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,280
delivering packages for money across

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,720
london to make this beautiful map and so

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,120
this data didn't end up being that

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,680
useful for openstream app but

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,720
the image created from this data was

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,960
terrifically convincing

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,960
that this was an idea that could work

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
not long after i met steve um and saw

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,759
that poster

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,600
i was setting up meetings with the likes

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,120
of yahoo and

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,120
o'reilly venture tech google

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,240
to see if there was some kind of like

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
business model or

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,880
way of of um funding openstreetmap is

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
obviously going to take a ton of

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
resources it wasn't going to build

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,319
itself

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,080
and um how is that going to happen and

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,120
so there was a lot of conversations i

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,000
mean i

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,440
um this one this email was just kind of

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,120
hilarious to me

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,479
uh after meeting from with google they

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,440
they wanted to

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,120
set up and test steve in some of the

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,960
recruiting tests

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,720
which i was very against i thought this

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,919
was a terrible

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,680
disrespectful way to treat this really

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,400
crazy project which hadn't proven itself

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,759
at all

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,639
um at the time um

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,440
the point is that we were it was very

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,039
blurry

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560
and we were trying to think about how is

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,720
this going to how is this going to work

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,759
how is this going to take off

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,039
and so that line this hard line was

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,240
just not there from the very beginning

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,599
steve um organized to support himself

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,280
his own you know his work on

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,479
openstreetmap on the core of the

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,960
infrastructure

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,080
um on promoting and advocating for

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,599
openstreetmap

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,080
sorry i'm just checking my time here um

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,759
for uh through first through at the

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,759
month of osm when anyone could come and

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,039
donate time uh donate money and would

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,759
pay for steve's time

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,599
uh later multi-map a uk company came

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,479
around and sponsored steve to do to do

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,160
some of that work

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,840
um and this is one of the days where

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,520
it's like it wasn't quite sure how this

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,639
was all going to come together

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,840
um so thank very thanks very much to

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,319
multi-map

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,680
i love the last line in this blog post

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,400
like what's in it for them

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,240
well that's not entirely clear right now

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,960
obviously there is publicity

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,160
um what is it for them um obviously

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,599
there's there's uh

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,880
there's leverage here on the on the

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,080
geodata market is what i think it

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,400
ultimately was about but

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,360
openstreetmap benefited and i think that

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,479
was a good bet though

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,360
multi-map doesn't really exist anymore

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,240
yahoo aerial imagery not long after this

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,160
not long after we set up those meetings

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
they did an amazing thing they donated

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,479
their imagery for use in openstreetmap

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,000
anyone could edit it uh digitize on top

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,879
of it

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,400
this is huge and yes i hear derisively

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,120
people talking about armchair mapping

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,879
but i challenge

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,759
anyone no matter who you are to go back

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,240
and use landsat imagery as the basis for

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,280
um

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,199
for your your mapping i did that um

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,639
in well not even using landsat just

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,360
using gps traces to

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,319
to map building footprints in brighton

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,840
it sucked

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,080
uh it was kind of interesting but it was

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,960
hard um i'm very glad we have this

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,360
resource

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,280
we have companies to thank for it it's

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,279
very valuable and we get

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,080
we get to use it and create free data

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,080
it's amazing

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,000
you may recognize these guys you see the

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
back of matt amos's head and the back of

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,560
andy allen's head there

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,160
from the cloud made days um they

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,839
spend a lot of time working on the core

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,200
infrastructure of openstreetmap

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,000
um and now i i've heard that the change

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,519
from

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,800
osm the api 0.5 to 0.6

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:04,480
it's not that big of a deal um but

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,920
0.6 is still the api that we use today

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,120
um and these guys spend time on it

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,640
in their working day that's awesome now

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,440
i'm not saying cloudmate was

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,320
sorely responsible for solely

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,519
responsible for

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,800
osm api 0.6 but

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,560
pretty significant contribution

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,040
um finally looking from the early

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,680
history back to state of the map

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,279
in manchester this is a lineup from the

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,959
two days of state of the map and

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,399
this really represents like the core of

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,040
the project at the time people

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,800
were like so into open stream up that

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,920
they traveled to manchester

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,399
they gave talks and i

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,920
added emoji money bags um to all the

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,080
presenters who

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,399
have had um professional

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,680
role that uses openstreetmap connects

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,399
with openstreetmap or connects with

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,760
mapping

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,760
and it's everything from yet from

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,880
individual cartographers to people in

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,000
big companies um

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,440
all but one two about four

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,600
of these presenters were um

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,680
were uh now have had some professional

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,040
benefit um that line between volunteer

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,440
and professionals just

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,360
uh doesn't hold it's a good thing it's a

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,519
good thing that we can be incentivized

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,040
and have the the privilege of working on

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,000
openshift as part of our professional

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,320
lives

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,680
um but i think uh there's kind of a

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,800
little bit of a mythology

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,360
mythologizing the pure volunteer which

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,600
just

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,959
isn't isn't that important and isn't

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,360
representative of the history of the

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,360
project

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,200
not to dismiss pure volunteers i think

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
they are awesome

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,800
i just don't think that is all you know

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,200
that that is the

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,920
the idealized way of contributing to osm

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,480
uh okay so companies i think that

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
there's a

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,399
misperception that all companies think

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,440
the same about openstreetmap or that

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,680
they're kind of lumped together

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,480
companies trying to make the big bucks

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,760
off of

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:06,160
off of the of the back of our community

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,959
maybe that's true some of them i have

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,959
one uh

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,120
quite insidious example let me just tell

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,440
you about what this company has been up

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,399
to

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,560
okay first of all if you go to

00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,279
openstreammap.org

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,880
they've integrated their services um

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,880
into this website

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,320
essentially free advertising is being

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,079
provided by our community to this

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,640
company

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,800
they've they're really so present on our

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,360
communication channels

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,920
not only are they like the dominant like

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,040
voice

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,040
in some ways they're controlling the

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,120
spectrum of our thoughts about open

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,720
street map

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,800
now here's where it gets really crazy

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,000
now on the foundation

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,360
they've maneuvered to retain a board

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,160
seat for their company

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
through multiple employees uh with

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
someone stepping down

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,040
and immediately another employee from

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,160
that company coming and filling that

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,079
seat

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,079
and listen here's what they say about

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,480
their their company motto essentially

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,399
free geodata created by projects like

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,279
openstreetmap will increasingly become

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,200
attractive for commercial uses very

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,279
attractive and very commercial

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,959
of course i'm talking about geofabric

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,440
who are awesome and do a lot of great

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,880
things and who are not horrible

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,160
in the slightest however

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,839
based off of the evidence it was not

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,519
hard for me to construct that narrative

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,279
um

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,880
let me say there's lots of companies uh

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,560
and lots of different kinds of companies

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,240
and uh an open street map you have

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,320
independent professionals

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,839
um your likes of richard fairfirst who's

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,959
a professional cartographer

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,839
small consultancies like geofabric

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,519
by cart but also seo spammers who we

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,079
definitely do not consider to be good

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,040
actors

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,160
in openstreetmap you have companies

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,600
which have sort of emerged from

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,240
openstream now people who are like

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,959
embedded in the community who have now

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,399
um

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,959
you know part of companies which have

00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,160
emerged and grown like like cloud made

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,440
uh map box a scobbler being

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,120
being part of tonav um

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,200
what's interesting in more recent years

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
or large established companies coming

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,720
into openstreetmap

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,639
um maybe there is something distinctly

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,800
different i don't know

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
microsoft facebook apple we know these

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,000
folks and

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,079
um as openstreetmap has become more

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,800
valuable

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,279
none surprisingly it's we've seen more

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,639
interest

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,320
from big companies and then there's this

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,120
other there's other class of interesting

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,399
companies

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,839
who do outsourcing work um who we don't

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,480
normally hear about not big big brands

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,760
doing work

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,920
largely for the large established

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,399
companies so the likes of global logic

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,600
and

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,199
rmsi it's important to see the the

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,120
distinctions i think

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:50,639
but despite all those distinctions what

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,959
i think is important is not if you're

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,639
a volunteer or professional i mean it's

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,000
important to recognize that

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,920
but it's really about what you bring to

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,399
the map you can be a volunteer and bring

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,160
like

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,680
lots of crap to the map you can be a

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,040
professional and bring be

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,839
an seo spammer what it is is the quality

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,199
and the intention in what you do i'm in

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,160
listen companies do

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:16,399
bring a lot to to osm they bring code

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,680
this is an amazing slide from john

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
fireball's talk

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,040
uh from 2014 state of the map us which

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,120
you should watch

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,160
um it's really great insights and what

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,279
it takes to

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,320
to um uh update

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,120
the website uh as as was done our

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,800
current website

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,480
or some dot org the look and feels

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,839
larger from this time

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,880
that is the pull request comments um

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,320
stream for it is huge

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,279
uh screenshot and um there's a lot of

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,639
dedicated work

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:52,639
um a lot of contributed code to make

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:56,000
the website better there is money

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,079
money does is important for

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,279
funding software development for funding

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,000
servers for

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,880
the conference um and companies have

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,199
always

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,320
been generous about this um sometimes

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,000
seemingly too generous

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:14,880
uh there was a the mapquest one million

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,800
um dollar uh div announcement um in 2010

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,920
um which did actually get you know put

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,199
to a lot of

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,040
of good use um supporting you know work

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,320
on math nick on nominated and

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,000
many other things and uh talked to randy

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
meech and the story story behind this is

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
like

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,240
randy coming in to to mapquest and then

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,680
part of aol

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,120
wanted to do something different wanted

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,800
to do something with openstreetmap and

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,600
this was remember mapquest used to be

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,000
was the mapping company and at this

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,839
point was

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,680
still trying to like figure out how to

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,639
how to catch back up

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,839
uh and overtake google maybe do

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,639
something with openstreetmap someone

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,720
higher up in the

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,560
in the company said what what do you

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,160
need a million dollars

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,160
and uh randy said oh yeah that'll do um

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,199
though at the time who do you give a

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,000
million dollars to

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,560
in openstreetmap the foundation um which

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,240
i think is

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,839
you know what randy was hoping for is

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,399
like let's donate some money

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
and see help good things to happen it

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,839
was definitely in 2010

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,279
not in a position to absorb one million

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,079
dollars i think we're getting there

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,399
today

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,759
and and doing good work with it uh i

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,800
think we could we could start to

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,720
consider that

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,440
kind of budget within the foundation but

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,920
it was a lot back then um

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,959
so money has its issues but it's

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,880
important

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,240
i recommend you check out randy's talk

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,839
from state of the map us

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:38,000
in 2015 the openstreetmap mba

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,480
talk also at that conference uh alex

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,920
from

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,720
mapbox uh gave the paid mappers are

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
coming

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,000
talk and they did come and um and they

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,399
were great people

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,040
um this was right before i joined mapbox

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,759
i joined

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,959
this team people were really passionate

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,920
about the map and really

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,240
understood the excellent place that they

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,120
were

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,560
in to contribute to openstreetmap as

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,360
part of their job

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,160
so they contribute a lot of data and a

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,240
lot of companies are contributing

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,600
very good data to a question now there's

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,240
also problematic data

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,959
i will i will admit but a lot of it is

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,079
good and

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,079
should be recognized as such

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,160
and people from companies are just

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,839
contributing their resources in time

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,160
um this was the state of the map logo

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,559
from 2009 2010

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,400
it was uh it was designed by a

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,400
cloud-made employee

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,559
lots of of people from companies have

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,080
helped spend time on state of the map in

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,600
uh 2016 the logo and the website and all

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,679
the design work was done by someone from

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,360
mapbox tatiana

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,200
and there's lots of work that peop ways

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,480
that people at companies have like have

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,640
given time uh have spent time on things

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,320
beyond you know money and code and data

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,440
but like on helping to build our

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,880
community and how we worked how we like

00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,559
come together now

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,000
um i think

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,080
start to try to peel back a little bit

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,559
like what it looks like on the inside

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,080
um for companies which are working in

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,280
openstreetmap

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,720
i think it's really important to

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,280
understand that internally tuned company

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,160
no matter how big or small there's not

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,240
consistency

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,320
you know there's a there's work to

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,280
present a consistent

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,799
result externally but just like any

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,440
group of people internally there's

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,880
debate

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,400
there is competition there's multiple

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,600
strategies

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,520
and um often with

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,760
you know especially with openstreetmap

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,360
there's one you know personality or

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,880
group of personalities who are really

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,720
driven into

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,320
to champion openstreetmap as something

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,679
that a company could do

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,360
um both for the value uh

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,039
of it as well as like what it can you

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,080
know what it can do for the world and

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,840
can do for

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,840
for this community so um

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,600
i think you know one way to think about

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,280
it and this is

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,120
a quote that um randy gave

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,559
when i when i talked with him about this

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,160
is you know businesses

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
don't want openstreetmap there is

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,080
someone within a business who wants

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,200
openstreetmap um and i think that's

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,840
really important to understand that

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,440
there's this

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,039
there's a lot of internal dynamics um

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,960
another thing to really realize is that

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,799
companies are not static you know they

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,559
not only they change strategies and

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,600
tactics and that's important to realize

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,520
because

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,120
um you know the amount of effort that a

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,240
company may be making today is going to

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,360
be different

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,280
um tomorrow could be more could be less

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,720
just the same as with individuals within

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,760
openstreetmap you know

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,160
someone may get another hobby or may you

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,520
know

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,240
might get busy with something else and

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,520
can't do open stream up in the same way

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,280
also companies learn um and and adapt

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,760
and i think it's important to recognize

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,520
that yes

00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:01,600
there can be past mistakes but you know

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,600
they adapt and can do better

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,360
so when companies look at openstreetmap

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,480
and particularly when people who are

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,919
trying to be that champion for

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,000
openstreetmap

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,360
i think some of the frustrations are

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,480
that

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,760
we don't have clear expectations of what

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,520
open what companies can do to do right

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,440
now you might say that there are you

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,559
have articulated them

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,120
um but i don't think that

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,400
they are i mean we are as a community a

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,280
cacophony

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,840
um and there's not like a single point

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,840
of

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,520
point of view it's a feeling that a

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,400
company can do no right no matter how

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,360
good

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,480
um a company might do judged on the on

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,400
like

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,760
what you know the biggest mistake or the

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,200
last mistake

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,039
so there's not a lot of listening and

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,080
explanation that's i think an impression

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,600
it's really hard to communicate

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,240
and then it's hard for a company to

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,440
communicate admittedly

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,880
um and

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,159
i think finally you know something i

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,679
learned from joining that box

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,799
um i've been at madbox for about five

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,200
years i've been with openstreetmap for

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,320
about 15 years so a third of my time has

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,520
been in a company

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,520
you know working working with

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,039
openstreetmap um

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,039
i've learned a lot about what it takes

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,320
to build a product here

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,559
when i in my time at mapbox and

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,159
it's hard to take you know to make

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,320
something that someone

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,280
likes so much and is so useful to them

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,440
that they will pay money for it

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480
it is not as simple as just slapping a

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,640
logo

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,760
on um on a download of um planet file

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,120
and uh i think there's oftentimes

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,720
there's not as much understanding as

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,000
there should be of like what of the

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,919
challenge if i going from

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,200
lots of resources out there whether data

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,280
code and

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,320
creating a creating a product and what

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,480
product thinking

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,159
and how you support customers and those

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,440
relationships it's

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,280
it's a lot of work and i think it

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:03,120
deserves some recognition

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,320
companies internally organize to work

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,960
with the community and they do that

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,280
because they recognize as companies

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,520
they need to have a

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,039
you know a higher uh there's a higher

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,320
expectation and they really should

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,080
should should deliver um better

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,360
performance to that to that community

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,360
and that means

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,720
um the community communication

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,559
um ideally is coordinated um

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,799
internally and that there's there's work

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,120
to think about how you're presenting

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,600
and working within the community so i

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,960
gave a talk at the hot summit last year

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,480
um really directed at hot explaining how

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,960
mapbox organizes itself um internally

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,480
um to work with osm including here's a

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,159
screenshot of

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,440
a um a github ticket

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,520
we're internally talking about how to

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,000
respond to a change set comment

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,840
and do that well and i think that's just

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,400
the facts of how companies have to

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:08,159
have to organize themselves all right

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,480
companies are great blah blah blah okay

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,159
they cause problems and i don't think

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,840
it's settled i don't think we've settled

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,880
how we can

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,679
organize um ourselves as

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,120
in companies or in the community to

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,400
really

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,080
take you know to solve these problems

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,919
together

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,600
first of all companies operate at a

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,240
massive scale this is a

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,760
image from jenny anderson's research

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,080
he's also talking at this conference

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,400
check it out

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,080
there's a lot of edits from companies

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,360
and that is

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,360
something that is hard to deal with and

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,320
we need to have good structures

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,120
to uh on all on both sides within the

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,559
community

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,880
within companies to to

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,600
work at this scale i don't think we have

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,360
that i know

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,840
guidelines are good i don't think

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,840
they're enough

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,640
yeah we need to we need to think about

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,640
scale

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,400
uh companies are

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,240
hesitant to be transparent and hasn't

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,279
and have difficulty communicating

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,760
um in a in a public sphere

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,480
uh communication is by committee that's

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,840
by that

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,200
it has to be that way often um and so a

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,080
lot of conversations with frank

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,840
conversations

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,440
happen in public they happen today they

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,600
happen in the past

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,039
this is the logo of osm plus which was a

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,320
kind of an attempt at a commercially

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,480
oriented openstreetmap conference

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,679
and i think that's a problem i don't

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,440
think

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,000
i think there needs to be a way for

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,480
companies point of view to be

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,960
to be known and for there to be dialogue

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,279
but there's not like a

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,000
a healthy place for that to happen um

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,640
and i think

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,919
you know companies also should need to

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,960
take the blame for not like making the

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,279
effort to figure out

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,039
how to do that well and to to take that

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,640
requirement seriously so there's some

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,279
things to do about

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,520
the communication and transparency

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,679
definitely

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,360
um the placement the place of companies

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,520
in the foundation

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,720
has long been a question i mean we have

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,120
corporate membership we also have

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,159
individuals who have membership

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,480
so before global logic which

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,919
by the way i think really was a

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,200
misunderstanding

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,559
um there was gobbler

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,640
a long time ago did a mass sign up

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,600
of employees they were going to be 10 of

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,360
the entire

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,520
membership and it was interesting back

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,159
then the board voted to

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,279
um kind of push their their memberships

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,240
forward so they wouldn't vote in the

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,799
election which

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,559
um most of the community was really

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,159
against and so there was an opposite

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,159
uh opposite dynamic back then

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,039
marketing and pr in the media you know

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,320
that reporters get things wrong

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:57,360
like cloud maids open street map um

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,880
an egregious example uh this is not

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,240
always the fault of the companies though

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,440
companies shirt like

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,640
yes like use fluffy hypey words

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,400
um but also it's a game of telephone

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,600
especially with reporters and then it

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,200
goes through their editors

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,039
and want to try to don't get into all

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,919
the details and you know the fine points

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,159
and so

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,600
oftentimes misunderstandings get blown

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,720
out of proportion

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,000
um in the media and that's that's um

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,360
i don't have answer to that but it's a

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,720
hard thing we need to we need to think

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,480
about

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:34,159
so some um some ways forward

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:37,200
yes i think we need to um

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,400
look at how organizations relate to each

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,000
other and

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,159
i think the openstreetmap foundation is

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,760
in a better place now to

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,840
center the relationships with companies

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,159
and be a place where companies can

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,080
can talk to the community and i'm not

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,520
talking about a smoke-filled room off to

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,000
the side like i think there needs to be

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,480
clarity

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,320
and transparency but in order to hold

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,960
like a productive conversation i think

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,799
osmf

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,080
is in a good position to figure out how

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,039
to uh

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,840
facilitate that we need to set clear

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,320
expectations

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,320
welcome.openstreetmap.org the welcome

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,880
mat is one attempt at that we could

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,720
really make that a lot better we could

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,400
use that a whole lot more

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,039
in order to set expectations of what we

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,840
want from companies

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,919
we have a format within the foundation

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,279
to hear from companies uh the advisory

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,159
board which includes some corporate

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,399
members

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,279
and local chapter heads i i don't think

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,679
it's worked

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,440
um as a single place to have a

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,799
conversation the interests between

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,640
local chapters and companies is so

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,760
different you want to ask kind of about

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,279
different things

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,240
so i think we should separate those

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,399
maybe a corporate members

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,600
group i don't want to say board you know

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,720
a group where you can

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,760
have conversations that help to bring

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,360
companies views

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,799
into the open and maybe that should be

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,960
open to all tiers of

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,240
corporate members not just the top tiers

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,600
because we want to hear from smaller

00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,000
companies too and their points of view

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,880
finally for individuals who are

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
professionally working with

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,720
openstreetmap

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,320
um how do we what are our ethics what

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,840
what is important what should we as

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,720
individuals

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,159
really commit ourselves to commit to to

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,399
bring into the community

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,720
you know in other disciplines there's

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,679
there are oaths uh doctors have the

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,320
hippocratic oath first do no harm

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,919
if you become a an employee of the

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,520
federal government

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,720
um or or are elected to to congress or

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,600
join the military you

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,159
you say an oath to support and defend

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,480
the constitution of the united states

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,840
i've done that our board chair has done

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,440
that and

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,120
i don't know maybe we need to have an

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,320
open stream map oath

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:48,480
so that we really commit to doing

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,960
right by this amazing community

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,559
so that is all as i said this is

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,320
incomplete

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,600
incomplete in coverage of the history

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,279
and of the work in

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,799
companies and both the good things and

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,720
the bad things about companies and

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,000
certainly the solutions so

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,200
i am now very interested to continue the

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,559
conversation

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,039
um and and hear what others think

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,760
and figure out how we can really um

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,600
solidif

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,080
you know put this put the relationship

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,159
on more firm footing so that we can

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,840
fix the things that need to be fixed and

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,520
um and do a lot of good

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,320
productive work together no matter how

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:29,919
we're coming to openstreetmap

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,919
that's all thanks that's all thanks

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,360
thank you thank you very much mika for

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,799
your presentation very interesting and

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,440
was very appreciated by

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,159
everyone they're starting with your ad

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,200
that the one that

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,960
you are wearing very very now so was

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,200
it appreciated and there was a lot of

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,000
comment about it but also about all the

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,559
talk

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,520
so i start with some question that i saw

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,480
in the pad

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,399
the first one is by gregory let's ask at

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,279
the start the corporations were good for

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,520
funding time

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,960
now oz foundation and health can give

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,440
out microgrants

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,399
so volunteer don't directly rely on

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,520
corporate money

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:10,399
it is better to have that separation

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,799
i think it's a great development yeah um

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,760
it's

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,279
it's excellent that our you know

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,480
structured entities within

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:21,200
openstreetmap now have the facility to

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,000
um provide support in many ways um to

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,840
volunteers and

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,279
money is one of them but there's other

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,559
ways to support volunteers and i think

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,799
the you know the foundation

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,880
and and he's like hot and in the local

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:34,320
chapters can can do a lot more so that

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,919
that folks can find ways to contribute

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,399
um i don't think that precludes

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,520
companies supporting things directly

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,279
of course but i'm really glad that the

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,399
foundation in particular is in a

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,399
in a stronger position now

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,039
okay thanks so there is a similar

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,120
question that

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,880
talks about should we make a distinction

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,600
between a profit build driving

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,039
corporation

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,039
and printed companies so between the

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,720
ended between the individuals inside the

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,279
corporation and the official election by

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,840
the

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,840
company

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,720
yeah um i saw i was watching the pad and

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,120
i saw there were some edits like there

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,799
was

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,399
like an association between profit

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,080
driven and large and

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,159
purpose driven and small i don't think

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,480
that necessarily holds and even within a

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,679
single company that can be

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,320
there can be nodes of

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,200
of people and groups and work within a

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,159
company which

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,440
are you know working at different

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,279
purposes

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,159
but to answer the question yes i think

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,519
it's important to make those

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,000
distinctions

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,360
and there's a lot of other ways to

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,240
[Music]

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,279
make distinctions about what companies

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,760
companies role

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,799
in osm and how we how we work with them

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,200
i think the most

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,840
important distinction is you know what

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,960
are they

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,000
contributing and how are they developing

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,360
and learning

00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,360
and how uh how receptive are they um

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:04,000
to to osm um while also keeping in mind

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,159
yeah are they big are they small

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,360
what's their what are their motivations

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,799
all those things are important

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,480
i think it's important to realize that

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,039
whether you're if you're talking about

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,159
communities or volunteers incentives

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,080
um really matter and um

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,600
it's it's complicated for everyone who's

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,880
in in openstreetmap so i i think that

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,399
that's excellent yeah we should we

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,840
should keep in mind all those

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,679
distinctions

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:32,240
okay so there is more question about

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,000
general about the volunteering if you if

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,320
you are dedicated to our volunteer map

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,320
editing can we or should we find place

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,080
to work that contribute to sm

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,279
do we have any suggestion on how to

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,559
approach to this issue

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,760
um maybe be careful what you wish for

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:53,360
um it has has good good sides and

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,279
uh and tough sides as well um

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,559
i i don't know if i have any i mean you

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,279
know there are

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,480
a lot of uh folks from companies that

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,679
stayed at the map so if that's the kind

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,240
of thing you're

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,039
interested in um find them and talk to

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,720
them this weekend um or reach out after

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,840
i think it's um you know maybe that's

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,440
something we should be talking about

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,240
more as a community and within the

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,480
foundation

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,080
um what is what are the for people who

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,360
are interested to

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,840
make this part of their professional

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,640
life um what are those pathways how do

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,240
you do that

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,000
um what do you need to um

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,600
what are what are good experiences what

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,080
are examples of bad experiences

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,440
um i i don't have i don't have all the

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,799
answers to that but i think it's

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,080
you know it's especially as osm grows

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,399
especially across other parts of the

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,640
world um you know the

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,519
the opportunity to work professionally

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,559
you know as i said

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,600
in 2007 was the 2008 you know

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,559
the first state of the map um a lot of

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,399
people were

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,080
doing this kind of work professionally

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,200
and i think

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,440
no we should we should

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,679
encourage that and find ways to make it

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,880
work really well

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,600
okay thanks just a fun a fun question

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,960
where did you get that

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,720
oh it's um my my wife

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,679
uh was uh unhappy that it was from my

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,960
wedding

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,040
i don't wear it i broke it off

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,159
after a long time broke it out um so

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,520
yeah it's from my wedding

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,520
i need to wear it more often i think

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,720
it's the what i'm writing

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,879
it's very getting a lot of positive

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,240
feedback so exactly wear it around the

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,119
house

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,119
so why do you think companies and

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,560
corporation no more invest in improving

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,480
openstreetmap core

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,000
but they invest in mapping and

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,000
developing tangential tool

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,280
well there's some truth to that i would

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,040
challenge the assumption there i mean i

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,119
think there there are plenty

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,079
of examples of companies contributing to

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,159
the core like i said

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,679
you know mapbox worked on the

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,159
openstreetmap website i think

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,599
you can consider id part of the the core

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,599
um

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,200
uh and i think there's even other

00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,760
examples happening now which people may

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,599
not be

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,160
aware of but

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,640
the truth there is that it is harder to

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,560
do

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,920
work in the core because there's more

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,200
dependencies there's more

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,240
more interests there's uh

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,640
the people who are involved in the core

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,680
are i would you know say stretch thin

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,200
and um

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,800
that's something that we're you know

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,480
we're thinking about on

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,960
the board within the foundation there's

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,760
a lot of conversations about how can we

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,000
make the core tools of osm something

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,200
where

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,079
there's more uh more space for

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,640
contribution and um and i think that

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,560
whether you

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:45,839
wherever you're coming from um there's

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,839
yeah to be continued

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,400
uh i just okay i lost one okay

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,160
uh they're asking for the slides but i

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,000
think that they will be published at the

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,079
end with all the

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,200
with all the material i put a link in

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,720
the in the pad

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,680
as well okay thanks so another

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,040
question uh companies do not want osm

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,920
people want to sm

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,000
but if there is is there not a danger of

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,480
of a company overall negative output

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,040
over shedding anything good they might

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,480
have been

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,960
not doing for to osmo should we engage

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,320
even

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,320
with such companies

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:30,320
i mean i think there's

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,320
both uh symptoms of

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,520
two negative views on companies and two

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,520
positive views

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,720
on what companies do and i don't think

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,680
there's a really

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,400
there's a lot of like fact based

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,440
assessment

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,280
of companies contributions it

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,839
is um you know something a company may

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,760
have done

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,680
years ago or uh is can overshadow lots

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,359
of good work and lots of good learning

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,200
i think that's the case with with

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,599
facebook it doesn't mean that they have

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,640
it perfect or that is not more to learn

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,000
um but it's

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,599
if things are going well then um

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,280
i think this is a truism in general it

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,520
doesn't get as much attention um

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:16,880
and so uh you know within openstreetmap

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,839
if i think that uh

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,880
there needs to be kind of a real

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,200
clear-eyed

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,240
look at companies contributions what's

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,880
the good what's the bad

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,880
and if a company is really doing bad

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,520
like yeah we should we should be

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,320
um we should be taking taking action and

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,240
i think you know

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,400
the one example which i think is really

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,119
consistent is like spamming

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,160
um sort of you know seo work within osm

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,839
it just doesn't

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,680
it's not what osm is about and uh um

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,599
but outside of that i just i don't think

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,960
that as a

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,119
the general conversation has a really

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,800
good handle on um

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,560
on the good and the bad and there's

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,640
there's maybe efforts to

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,200
for the to make the bad overshadow the

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,839
good um by some folks

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,720
okay thanks i joined two questions there

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,359
was one like

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,480
a little bit provocatory who is the the

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,200
tool came out

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,400
and why we cannot write a complete

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,960
history of

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,400
you say that your history is partial or

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,359
is not total and

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,079
why we don't write these all together a

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,079
collaborative

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,680
history these are not there is not a

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,040
real reply to this question it's just a

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,839
provocation tool

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,359
yeah i know yeah it's a good it's a good

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,960
idea i don't want to claim that i

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,400
have all that i that even everything

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,240
that i've said is right like a lot of

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,079
this stuff is 15 years ago and i may

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,480
well have like misremembered something

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,000
and so um

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,440
yeah i'm not i'm not gonna be able to

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,240
tell the whole story i think telling the

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,960
whole story is

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,480
is a good idea um but it's hard um but

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,640
yeah let's do more of it

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,760
um who's this talk for um

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,800
i really had to mine

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,079
maybe um similar to frederick people who

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,119
are newer to osm

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,720
and hear a lot of the i think the the

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,720
narratives and the

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,000
the reddit rhetoric and the discussions

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,359
that happen and

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,800
um may not have all of the the history

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,640
um and even people have been around a

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,320
long time may not have had all

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,000
all the history up front i've never i've

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,440
never talked about like setting up

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,280
vc meetings for steve in 2005 before

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,599
um and uh

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,800
that so yeah i think that there's

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,760
there's just a lot we

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,599
along the way i think the the in the

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,119
early days of osm

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,960
first five years i think everything was

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,880
a lot more fluid it was a lot more

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,880
experimental um uh maybe more fun

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,640
and uh not that it's not fun now very

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,400
fun but uh

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,599
i think there's uh at a certain point

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,320
um the we kind of got a little bit stuck

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,480
in some of the

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,599
some of the the arguments and so i'm

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,960
trying to

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,880
very transparently like i'm trying to

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,240
like let's let's reset that and let's

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,760
look let's look again with fresh

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,079
eyes and not to

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,760
relitigate things of the past but like

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,000
how are we going into the future in a

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,359
way that's that's going to be

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,359
be productive for and and good for

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:17,280
openstreetmap and for our community okay

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,720
they are thanks so uh assuming another

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,040
question coming back to

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,079
the role of the companies for companies

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,240
that are bad actor

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,280
how we should we identify them and how

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,280
we should deal with them

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,720
it's not simple yeah i don't know um

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,480
that's a very good question i mean i

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,359
think i think that's something we have

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,720
to reckon with

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:41,599
um uh i think that's

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,359
really there's a role for for the

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:47,119
foundation and thinking that through

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,880
um but i don't

00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,560
i don't have a good answer to be honest

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,240
it's a good question

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,079
yeah sure that is not there's not a

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,880
simple question it can be a discussion

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,440
between the also

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,000
all the members of the foundation and

00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,839
also

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,359
from the board to identify which are

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,319
which are the criteria that they find

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:07,040
that uh accompanies a bad actor and

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,040
which are the action

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,119
i think clear about what we consider you

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,480
know

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,319
positive contribution to osm and um

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,839
and communicate that so that it's also

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,880
you know there's also uh

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,880
we set the expectations um i don't think

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,040
i don't think presently expectations for

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,680
for companies in osm are very clear

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,800
because it's

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,920
it's just a cacophony of voices and

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,240
um i think say to start with setting

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,680
like

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,720
what is what is a positive contribution

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,720
would be a really good start

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,400
okay so there is another question what's

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,280
the secret to asking slash telling

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,200
google or facebook anything do we do the

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,720
there are too big to wear the average

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,119
person anymore

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,839
like press the feedback back button oh

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,079
there is

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,760
the only way is to have a media media

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,800
make stories which they must

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,400
reply to that is really not the only way

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,000
i mean google

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,839
i don't know i mean i know i know folks

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,720
at google but it's not really on the

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,920
you know radar of osm we try to i mean

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,839
there was a lot of

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,040
conversations and work in the early days

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,480
to get

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,560
uh google interested in osm um

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,640
but obviously they took a different a

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,839
different approach

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,480
likes of facebook um

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,040
there's a couple things first people who

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,440
are

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,040
um who are at facebook are part of the

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,480
community that so there are individuals

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,040
yes you can't like

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,319
email a you know webmaster at

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,920
facebook.com and

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,520
reply about you know with some questions

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,119
about openstream app but there are

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,960
people you can talk to

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,400
um and i really mean like talk to them i

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,040
mean it's one thing to have a

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,920
you know a conversation um on a mailing

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,040
list or

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,920
or on social media but um like alan

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,119
mustard laid out in um in his talk

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
actually getting on the phone and people

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,119
and really getting to

00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,079
have a conversation is and understand

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,640
um their points of view and and i think

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,240
is really

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,240
a good idea and they're i think

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,160
guarantee they're they're people

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,280
from all companies who are ready for

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,079
that um

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,200
if you know you don't know who they are

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,839
then that's i mean i think that's

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,880
something that

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,920
we can work on um and the other thing is

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,119
that like there's

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,640
you know i think that there should be

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,760
more of an organizational relationship

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,440
between the foundation

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,200
and companies um so that

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,480
the you know concerns that are are

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,520
raised and issues that are

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,560
found can be can be talked about

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,760
um with a group of people

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,920
where there's you know there's an

00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,240
ongoing relationship um and that's not

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,680
to

00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,839
you know not to um make it easy to

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,119
to to let companies off the hook for

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,200
problems but

00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,880
um developing that kind of

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,119
organizational

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,400
tissue between between osmo and

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,960
companies i think

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,800
will help to raise things up and um and

00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,480
have substantive

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,599
um conversations and replies to them

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,040
okay thanks just the last question after

00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,079
we have some comments that are

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,319
some funny so we can read

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,640
so what do you think about the way that

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,640
some germany companies took in pasta

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,800
they visited the regular often local

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,640
meetings in towns and regions

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,000
of the austin community in order to

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,640
learn how osm works

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,200
think this is a good approach or a roast

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,599
of course it doesn't work

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,599
i think that's great yeah no definitely

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:35,440
um going and connecting with

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,000
with people directly around around the

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,960
world

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,960
is is great i think that happens we just

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,400
may not all be aware of when that

00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,400
you know when that's happening i mean i

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,200
know in

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,680
the us matt boxes like has a lot of has

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,720
been

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,440
quite involved with different meetups

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,440
and we have

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,880
we know a lot of folks here we probably

00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,680
know less of the folks in germany it's

00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,079
harder to get to but i think like

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,280
there's you know when we can all travel

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,760
again

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,280
or maybe even just like joining via you

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,480
know

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,200
via uh online chat like i think yeah

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,680
having

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,560
direct conversations is is really good

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,760
so yeah that's a

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,440
you know what's hap what's happened in

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,119
germany i think sounds like a great a

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,400
great model for

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,400
other parts of the world to pick up

00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,920
okay just just a fun thing there is a

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,000
required

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,000
ip correct battle between of history

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,720
about you and frederick

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,359
there are more more up about the

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,200
population

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,200
of the world but there is some

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,319
suggestion also by heather that

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,640
there is there have been some past uh of

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,359
this

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,560
epic battle inside those foundation

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,440
board meetings

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,000
so just one last question that's uh that

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,760
is written

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,560
now let's just wait some second that is

00:45:49,760 --> 00:46:00,400
finished to writing

00:45:52,560 --> 00:46:02,800
and also just reading some of the

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,160
okay so the last question since we are a

00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,319
little bit late

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,640
with more one on the ground mapping

00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:11,680
community building on the ground beyond

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,240
beyond the humanitarian osm how does see

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,079
the role

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,079
of poor local community volunteering

00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,560
uh yeah this is a very complicated topic

00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,680
one that i'm

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,839
intimately familiar with i

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,000
was part of the start of map kibera in

00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:31,359
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,720
there's a very uh poor slum

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:36,800
in nairobi and uh i very quickly found

00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,359
that like the model of volunteering that

00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,319
we

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,200
had in europe and in the states and

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:45,920
other places

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,920
doesn't doesn't work um and

00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,040
so it's a big yeah it's a big question i

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,040
think um

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,720
the important thing i think for the

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,160
global machine map community to

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,000
to realize is that things are going to

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,520
look different and

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,079
but that doesn't that ultimately doesn't

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,640
take away from the passion and what

00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:10,079
people want to contribute to the project

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,440
and so if there's you know no you cannot

00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,240
expect that people are going to

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,440
come to a meet up at you know at a

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,000
coffee shop

00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,560
in nairobi if they're living in kibera

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,640
because

00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,160
uh you know maybe that's far away to go

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,079
if it's in the evening it may not be

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,480
safe to get back home

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,200
after the they're not going to have

00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,240
money to

00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,760
buy a coffee i mean or you know their

00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,800
money needs to be spent on something

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,040
else

00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,160
so um you really have to understand

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,599
where people are at

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,800
and i think we everyone i mean i've

00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,400
always heard from everyone in

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,839
openstreetmap that it's super important

00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,680
that the people who

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,880
um are from the place are involved in in

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,240
mapping but what

00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,559
you have to realize is that that you're

00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,280
you're pulling a thread which unravels a

00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:00,640
huge amount of complexity in terms of

00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,359
um our political and economic systems um

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,880
and uh i think we we have the we know

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,359
where we're going we have the

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,200
kind of the north star of what the what

00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:11,680
the ideal is everyone is like

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,800
mapping where they live um but it's

00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,800
gonna

00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,880
the the the tactics and how we get there

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,119
are have to look different there's no

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,359
there's things adapt um in different

00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,520
parts of the world

00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,599
and so i think that's the most important

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,599
thing to understand about

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,960
you know a large part of the world which

00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,839
is looks really

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,559
different than washington dc or

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,160
heidelberg

00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,839
thank you thank you very much mike for

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,640
your talk and for the reply of

00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,440
the question i think that most of them

00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,200
we replied

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,440
i don't know it's something we missed

00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:49,920
maybe it's my call

00:48:45,440 --> 00:49:03,839
okay so thank you very much and

00:48:49,920 --> 00:49:03,839
