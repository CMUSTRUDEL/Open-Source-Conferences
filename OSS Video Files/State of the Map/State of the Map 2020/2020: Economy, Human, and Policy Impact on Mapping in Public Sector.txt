This talk is based on the experiences I faced while working with the public sector on mapping and try to identify some of the impacts that made and answering 3 questions which arise: 
* How much Money should I spend?
* How much Accuracy do I need?
* How much Human Involvement?

In this talk, I will be explaining experiences faced while working on some of the major projects in public sector related to FOSSGIS and where all we could implement OSM into.
Some of the major projects are as:
##### Utility mapping of State Electricity Board:
Comprehensive solution for mapping was developed for Kerala State Electricity Board. The solution included a. Mobile field survey and mapping tool b. Map editor for post production and drawing c. Map viewer d. Map printing e. various intermediate data processing and conversion tools. Complete tool chain was designed and field tested. KSEB used our approach to map 11Kv electric poles of distribution department. This covered around 14 Lakhs electric poles. The original cost estimate for the work by KSEB using traditional approach and proprietary systems was around Rs 200 crores. Technological solution developed by ICFOSS will dramatically reduce cost of mapping and lead to substantial saving of public exchequer. The benefit through utilisation of the map data like electricity loss minimisation and quality improvement is also to be noted. For the original price, work would not have happened. The entire process was based on technologies and standards around
OpenStreetMap.
##### Participatory mapping of Govt. Offices
Government of Kerala aims to build a spatial database of whole Kerala based on OpenStreetMap. A participatory model was planned for the field survey and the execution was planned in different phases; Government Institutions mapping, Road and Waterways mapping, etc. As preliminary phase, govt. Offices mapping was done by developing an HTML5 based Laravel web application. And this will be later on validated and uploaded to OSM.
##### Route analysis for Govt. Fiber Optic Network
A dedicated Optic Fibre Network (Kerala state Fibre Optic Network) connecting 30000 of Government Institutions including schools and other departments was planned. Substations of KSEB (Kerala State Electricity Board) across the state were chosen to create the backbone network installing PoPs (Point of Presence) at each substation. As part of the planning phase, total length of fibre cable required was to be found. Based on GIS based routing techniques and derived methodologies, cluster of networks and total length estimate were identified.
##### Canal digitisation within 42 sq.km. paddy area
Government of Kerala aims to map canal system within Thrissur Kole Wetlands an area of around 4300 hectares to measure total water holding capacity of the system. A drone based aerial survey model was planned for the data collection and further digitisation and volume measurements were done using OpenDroneMap and OpenStreetMap based toolchain.

the next session will be by aaseesh

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:16,170
Abraham Joseph will be talking on the

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,750
economic human and policy impact on

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,869
mapping in the public sector in this

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,590
session he'll be using projects such as

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:27,710
the utility mapping of State Electricity

00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:30,330
of the State Electricity Board

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,820
participatory participatory mapping of

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,489
government offices and so many more to

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,590
explain the experience in working on

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,890
some of the major projects in the public

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,640
sector related to free and open source

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,149
yes pledge funds and where they

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,399
implemented Open Street Map data so

00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:53,430
without much more to do as he shall go

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,829
ahead and if you have any questions as

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,020
he'll be presenting feel free to add

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,940
these questions to the session pad where

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,470
and you can find this on the detail

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:08,150
description in the program thank you so

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,150
much congratulations

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:18,590
hello Marie so myself

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:22,020
Ashish from India so I'm here to present

00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:25,890
some experiences during working with

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:30,000
public sector government departments so

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:36,810
the some of the impacts will be Saudi

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:42,479
bring some serious economic human and

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:48,960
policy impacts let me myself so I'm

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:52,140
basically Fox is doing some results

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,149
actor piece we perform the state

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,430
government force agency called I suppose

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,880
and currently I am working with the

00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,880
startup

00:02:05,000 --> 00:03:11,670
yeah so generating disaster preparedness

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:15,470
and next thing is this one thing which

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:20,190
we've done as a technical support the

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:25,049
state ID is an IT department for project

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:29,600
initiative on my path on camera H topics

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,600
how did these so

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:49,230
[Music]

00:03:34,500 --> 00:04:00,270
and it was because of the huge features

00:03:49,230 --> 00:04:03,990
to be man but going for any satellite

00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:06,630
imagery protection mechanisms but we

00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:15,810
could find out less expensive to be

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:19,530
using and we could just train them to

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,900
use open etiquette for feeding is our

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:29,070
way and using the proper netiquette

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:32,540
almost 6,000 people in three days with

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:35,540
less than 5 min I gotta see so that was

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,540
required

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,549
[Music]

00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,279
[Music]

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,940
[Music]

00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,720
[Music]

00:05:21,930 --> 00:06:28,450
we project which was my state government

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:34,560
offices of velocity thousand visits and

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,560
we just made up the application using

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:42,509
behaviors or she login for each

00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:45,030
departments and fixes so any member of

00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:48,599
each office can log into this social

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:53,960
using social dogging and then we

00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:57,530
basically coming with coming up with

00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:01,500
asking the radical equation and these

00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:03,960
attributes standardized you know I some

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,650
standard and we just collected those

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,289
informations for almost 17,000 were

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:16,919
mapped with an accuracy of less than 20

00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:18,810
minutes currently and once you have an

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,789
innate and sanitized all the data and

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:25,349
this will be published to our son later

00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:37,340
and currently the per hundred apartment

00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:41,250
is in all of the projects fiber-optic

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:49,050
state done by IT infrastructure of our

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:53,340
state so but initially regarding the

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:57,360
total cable length requirement for the

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:59,940
Virgin planning's so initially the

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,240
mathematical calculations who are going

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:08,510
pretty good then we came to a conclusion

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:12,949
that das help rather than

00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:17,309
[Music]

00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:20,699
traditional calculations so we just go

00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:23,610
with the locations which we covered in

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:26,459
the earlier weeks using this parts

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:31,759
battering mapping and those fixing

00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:34,979
kitchens being poured into this these

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,819
offices for initial plan of fiber-optic

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:42,380
network and then from the point of a

00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:46,079
census your piece of the station knows

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:48,209
the fiber-optic from those to each of

00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:54,029
offices will be this one will go get him

00:08:48,209 --> 00:09:06,720
to see using and using horizontally and

00:08:54,029 --> 00:09:12,690
we could get some yes and we could get

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:25,980
some data from them and we and using it

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:30,449
before then we just sanitized some data

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:33,990
using us and grass plugins and we could

00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:38,600
make it in a single network structure

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:42,649
and finally we could find out the almost

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:46,250
approximate length 30,000 kilometers

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:50,029
using the same QGIS plug-in from

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,029
calculated and

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,950
[Music]

00:10:32,419 --> 00:11:15,269
you cannot area and that's how he knows

00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:18,509
we just as we just have a single line

00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:21,359
structure for canal system but here we

00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:23,850
wanted in the three times with all three

00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:28,979
dimensions that's why we were pricing it

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:31,559
out by using this and after that making

00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:35,189
the big image of this later

00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:38,579
we just surveyed from different points

00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:42,589
using cover drop box and using those

00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,589
sample values and connecting

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:56,510
[Applause]

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,730
it was lucky for local self Boris and

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:02,190
this was done in rigor of disaster

00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:06,630
preparedness along with the steep mrs.

00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:15,060
Ramanujan authority here we had her we

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:17,760
have instructions and concern the

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,260
requirement was almost 30 different

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:31,310
layouts 30 different thematic maps and

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:31,310
using those things

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,340
[Applause]

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,170
[Music]

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:58,940
less than three days so there is some

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:04,190
kind of achievement which we make out in

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:07,920
regard with disaster preparedness so

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:11,460
last but not least current browser which

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:22,460
we are running upon and our state itself

00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:25,380
is something called the disaster excuse

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:28,770
natural disaster ratios as well and

00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:39,510
landscape currently being heard the

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:42,480
Korean it's it's still continue so Steve

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:47,960
s plan to make an initiative en masse

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,960
initiative or putting out the whole day

00:13:51,060 --> 00:15:24,020
[Music]

00:13:52,690 --> 00:15:29,900
so so so processing or something like

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:32,660
that then the party shooted across 200

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,180
crores I mean everything so that was the

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,880
initial estimate we could find out for

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,190
finding out this thing so they were

00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,760
planning to buy it some higher solution

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:46,970
subtly maybe three words over that was

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,550
cost brakes in fact I think but later on

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:52,240
we could propose something using

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:56,990
operatic it and

00:15:52,240 --> 00:16:12,050
stuff itself so in we can see the

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:14,839
accuracy city was less than 5 min people

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,970
the Roxxon change is happening with the

00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,800
network day by day there will be some

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,829
additions there will be some operations

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,510
so those things we have to change itself

00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:26,779
one more on the way

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:31,870
so first big graph just map it out

00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:31,870
whatever things are there then using

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:40,699
[Music]

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:44,949
just those based on the satellite images

00:16:40,699 --> 00:17:05,720
or any other provisions which we have so

00:16:44,949 --> 00:17:20,030
then we would have that much stuff which

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:25,600
have for us so using those 60,000 people

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:25,600
is none sorry those 6,000 people we just

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:33,230
spread across 60 thousand kilometer and

00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:46,450
line length span of the network so that

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:46,450
is one thing the main one is also

00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,220
growing the human environment rather

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:56,120
than money being spent over money being

00:17:52,220 --> 00:18:00,590
spent and in those regards how to

00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:04,040
balance the accuracy then without being

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:06,260
much money spent and involving the human

00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:11,690
eye we can mean in the natural seed that

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:16,460
was being concerned in projects achieve

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:20,560
something way better every result of

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:25,370
each projects were really good for

00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:50,080
regarding the government purposes that's

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:50,080
all thank you so myself in my ideas

00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,059
you

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:27,480
great it's been really amazing seeing

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:30,900
the use of OpenStreetMap data and also

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,680
free and open source special software in

00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,700
the urban planning space and

00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,490
infrastructure development as you've

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,680
presented we have a few questions that

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:47,760
have been have been posted in this

00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:51,180
session so the first one is what

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,400
addressing standards why used to provide

00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,980
addresses and you need permanent cuts

00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,140
for plotted buildings and have you

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:07,770
considered using open location cards

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:11,460
from Google hi thanks a lot okay we

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:19,290
haven't used a means of location

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:23,790
standards there was one concern they

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:28,640
require and such any numbers but that I

00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,640
am we couldn't give any such solutions

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:57,900
okay so for the second question is how

00:20:52,370 --> 00:21:01,130
open is the data government data in area

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:04,650
is it is the fact is governor is the

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:09,870
cushion the exertion is is much data a

00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:18,360
government secret there so I guess the

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:21,060
person actually is yeah I think so so

00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:26,010
regarding that question it is really

00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:28,770
interesting I currently go in dormant in

00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:32,150
process of creating open data policy

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:35,970
for releasing the most of the data as

00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:39,570
public in regard of Luigi is that also

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:44,250
but mostly some of the departments are

00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:47,610
yet to release this date and I think

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:50,100
most of the data's are still not open

00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:53,610
just regard of the accuracy issues and

00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:57,810
some sort of confidence issues how we

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:59,880
can publish it so that is the main

00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:04,790
concerns most of the departments which

00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:09,630
are showing it as a what is suppressing

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:13,680
the data to public rather than being

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:16,280
giving in to as open so right now

00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:20,640
regarding some of the projects which we

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:25,670
did the one electric mapping that one

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,670
project whole data is public and also

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:37,040
the dormant institution mappings those

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:40,860
data are also recently being public so

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:46,340
once the validation is completed those

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:46,340
data will be added into OpenStreetMap

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:56,250
great the next question and I swim

00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,110
presented something on

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:04,750
telecommunications this person is asking

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:10,360
so 30 kilometers is the proposed fight

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:12,370
by nature so how much fiber is that like

00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:19,929
how much tremendous does that just led

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:22,690
to yeah actually I also have don't have

00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:29,320
much idea about the real numbers in the

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:30,160
field the our involvement there

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,530
basically

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:36,400
regarding the budget planning purpose

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:40,300
those areas and we didn't get any actual

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,720
numbers rendered or implementation so I

00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:48,580
I mostly I hope numbers are almost

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:57,340
similar to the one steep proposed okay

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:59,860
the last question is on the map are your

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,400
mapping team so so many the scheme how

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,380
did you find recruit and train 6,000

00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,150
mappers for the project for the first

00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:13,330
project that you mentioned in a

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:17,260
presentation yeah actually that those

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:22,630
6,000 are already the electricity board

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:26,290
and we just collected those builds ups

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:29,410
from each different areas so then they

00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:31,780
have a basic idea of basic technical

00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:37,200
ideas they are just the field offices

00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:40,540
themselves working and we just give them

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,260
basic training on opened etiquette how

00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:47,650
to use the surveying tool for the

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:50,710
purpose of mapping the arid poles we

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:54,309
just gave them a basic training using

00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,930
virtual motors and those that was very

00:24:54,309 --> 00:25:02,500
much what is

00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:11,630
effort you and in less than 15 days

00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:13,910
almost popping up in each day's able to

00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:37,220
finish up the whole thing within

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:39,110
expected delivery times hey that was the

00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,150
last question thank you so much for

00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:45,320
sharing it does the projects that you've

00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:46,880
done in your area we've not had have

00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,490
nots personally I've not had so much

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,200
about I assume in there in this fest

00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,730
they are bent lining and infrastructure

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,550
development space it's been nice

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:58,220
learning a thing or two about this and I

00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:01,580
guess we look forward to catching up

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,380
with like the progress of this project

00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,130
and how much more we can learn and

00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:11,300
implement in other countries as well

00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:15,590
thank you so much as ish yeah thanks a

00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:17,710
lot thanks not this opportunity thank
