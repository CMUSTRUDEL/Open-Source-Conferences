Walkability is the foundation for urban life that is sustainable, inclusive, healthy, and dignified. Pedestrians First is a new open-source suite of tools for using OSM data to measure indicators of urban walkability. During this talk, we will examine the nature of walkable and unwalkable cities, we will discuss the opportunities and limitations of using OSM to measure walkability, and we will consider possible avenues for extending Pedestrians First in the future.

Few modern cities are walkable. Around the globe, cities have been designed for cars rather than pedestrians, resulting in enormous costs to the environment, the economy, and even the social fabric of our communities. In the face of the climate crisis, there is an urgent need to build cities that are sustainable and inclusive. Responding to that need, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy has released Pedestrians First, a tool that supports planners and decision-makers by using OSM to measure what matters for walkability in cities.

This talk will describe what makes a city walkable, discuss the experience of using OSM to measure walkability, and explore possibilities for improving that measurement in the future.

Because the experience of walking is so natural, it is easy to assume that planning walkable cities is equally simple. That is far from the case. To be walkable, a city must prioritize pedestrians not only in urban design but also in land use and transportation planning. Some factors, like sidewalk quality, matter at the small scale, the level of the street or the city block. Other factors matter at the level of the neighborhood, such as the proximity of destinations, and still others are at the level of the entire city, like the ability of a public transit system to move pedestrians from one neighborhood to another. 

We have found OpenStreetMap an invaluable tool in identifying and measuring the most important elements of walkability. Certain aspects of the OSM data model have been critical to the success of the project, especially its emphasis on representing connectivity, its typology of streets, and its relative uniformity around the world. However, other aspects have been challenging to work with, and prevent us from measuring other important indicators of pedestrian-friendliness. For example, it is still difficult to clearly represent the presence and quality of sidewalks in OSM and assessing the safety of street crossings remains a pressing concern.

There are many opportunities to expand Pedestrians First. We are exploring possibilities that include computer vision to identify street assets, integration of traffic data, and measurement of multimodal access to opportunities. We hope to join conversations about how best to implement such approaches within the OpenStreetMap community. 

With offices in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, and the United States, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy has advocated for sustainable urban transport since 1985. A non-governmental organization striving for inclusive cities, ITDP is dedicated to openness of information and techniques.

it's the most common form of transport

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,639
in the world

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,799
we all do it a little differently but

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,359
it's our most common way to travel

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,720
walking is immediate carbon free and

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,480
free

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,000
just people connecting directly with

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,560
their environment and with those around

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,039
them

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,840
walking creates communities it's also

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,519
healthy

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,519
we've long known that regular walking

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,720
can reduce our risk of a whole host of

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,399
chronic diseases

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,920
but recent studies have directly linked

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,960
living in walkable neighborhoods

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,360
with lower rates of obesity and diabetes

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,719
good for health good for the environment

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,440
good for the community

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,079
walking is a basic human right so why

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,320
are so

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,239
many of our urban spaces so hard to walk

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,840
in the answer is simple

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,520
in the world's biggest and fastest

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,800
growing cities people have been

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,800
displaced by cars

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,559
and cities designed for cars are not

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,559
good for pedestrians

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,920
millions risk their lives every day to

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,399
get where they need to go

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,440
all over the world half of the 1.3

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,960
million people

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,840
killed in road crashes each year are

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,920
pedestrians cyclists or motorcyclists

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,760
traffic injuries are the leading cause

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,080
of death in people 15 to 29

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,240
traffic collisions also cause between 20

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,040
and 50 million injuries every year

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,960
and our major cause of disability in the

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,479
world's fastest growing cities

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,840
deaths from traffic collisions are

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,400
expected to grow to 2.4 million a year

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,640
by 2030 even though the majority of the

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
people in these cities don't own cars

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
in african cities such as kinshasa and

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,040
dar es salaam

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,159
70 of the population travel primarily by

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,920
foot or bicycle

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,920
in asian cities like guangzhou and

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,759
manila around have to

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,759
more than 90 percent of the world's road

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,640
deaths occur in low and middle-income

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,960
countries

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,320
but these countries only have 48 of the

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,159
world's vehicles

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,079
despite the hazards of a car focused

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,040
environment and the many benefits of

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,719
walking

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,320
most cities still spend the majority of

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,600
their transport budget building more

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,280
roads for cars

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
making life ever more hazardous for

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,600
pedestrians these investments encourage

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,080
more people to drive which creates yet

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,440
more demand for cars and so the cycle

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,150
continues

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,720
but we can change that cycle

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,760
[Music]

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,000
we can use openstreetmap to help measure

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,480
and

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,319
understand walkability in cities all

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,800
around the world

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,959
my name is taylor rich i use they them

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,560
pronouns and i'm a research associate at

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,000
the institute for transportation and

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,480
development policy

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,680
where i work on pedestrians first

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,879
pedestrians first

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,560
is a tool a website that igp hopes to

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,879
release in september

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,920
to help people in cities all around the

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,360
globe

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,560
understand measure and advocate for

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,319
walkability locally

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,599
walkability is very important and i hope

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,680
that that last video

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,599
helped you understand some of why but

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,319
walkability is especially important

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,560
right now

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,200
because walkability is part of a

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,200
coronavirus recovery strategy

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,800
research has found that people in china

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,920
especially in china's biggest cities

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,640
like guangzhou

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,280
shanghai and beijing are walking more

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,120
now

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,760
than they did before the virus

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,879
people have gotten out of metro trains

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,400
and buses

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,640
and put on their shoes and started

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,000
walking to get where they need to go

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,440
um walking is especially important for

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,799
coronavirus recovery

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,560
when sidewalks are wide enough

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,200
because it enables people to move around

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,040
the city at a safe social distance

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,599
of course that means that we have to

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,799
invest in walkability and actually build

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,879
infrastructure for walking make sure

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,239
that it's safe enough to be used as

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,080
transportation

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,159
during growing buyers recovery um

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
walkability is very complicated though

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,360
it's a lot more

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,280
than just a sidewalk there are many

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,360
details there are many factors

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,360
and walkability is something we have to

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,760
talk about at many different scales

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,360
from the size of the block to the entire

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,000
size of the city

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,519
that's why itdp has divided pedestrians

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,519
first into four different tools

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
the first three of them the street

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,599
measurement tool the neighborhood

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,040
measurement tool and the transit system

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,160
measurement tool

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,000
um really rely on

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,080
very fine details often things like the

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,400
presence or absence of street furniture

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,680
the shape of a sidewalk

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,600
the way that the curb um

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,960
creates a boundary between a sidewalk

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,479
and discreet

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,240
and then at the neighborhood scale we

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,000
have to talk about things like the exact

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,840
distribution of services

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,360
the variety of transit options are

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,199
available that are available in order to

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,479
support walking

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,040
um the

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,520
the ways that the buildings meet the

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
street

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,280
are they are they lively do they

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,800
contribute to a sense of neighborhood

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,320
activity and vitality

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,199
or are they sort of cold and dead

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,479
without lots of windows

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,639
and these sorts of things can really

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,759
only be measured by a human being who's

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,440
familiar

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,160
with the street or neighborhood that

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,160
we're trying to measure

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,400
but in order to understand the

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,560
walkability walkability at a city level

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,120
we found that openstreetmap is actually

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,639
an incredibly powerful source of data

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,520
to help us help us measure several

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
different indicators of walkability that

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,680
are meaningful

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,960
at a citywide scale uh what does that

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,280
look like

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,800
well let me show you a demonstration

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,880
um here is the city of cape town

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,320
where i wish we could all be right now

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,840
so that i could see you all in person

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,320
and get to talk to you

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,759
um but maybe looking at it on a map will

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,320
be almost as good

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,479
uh the first indicator that pedestrians

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,680
first can use openstreetmap to measure

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,199
is the indicator of block density um

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,000
smaller blocks are better for

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,080
walkability in a city

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,960
made of small blocks it's easy to walk

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,560
directly from point a to point b

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,720
and choose the most comfortable way to

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,960
do so without having to go

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,280
in a wide detour all around a building

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,840
or an obstacle

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,520
we can see here that this neighborhood

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,160
is seems to be relatively walkable it's

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,880
composed

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,039
largely of fairly small blocks and makes

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,680
it easy to get from point a to point b

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,280
similarly this neighborhood also seems

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,960
to be fairly walkable

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,960
uh but the two are divided from each

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,720
other by this this parkway

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,240
um and the very large blocks that

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,960
accompanied which

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,800
i would imagine i unfortunately can't

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,360
actually go there this weekend

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,560
um probably makes it very difficult for

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,840
people to walk from one of these

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,840
neighborhoods to the other

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,120
another indicator of walkability is the

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,000
degree of access that people have to

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,720
daily social services especially schools

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,720
and healthcare

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,800
now we would have loved to include other

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,080
services

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,599
in this measurement as well um

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,280
but we found that schools and healthcare

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,599
were really the only key

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,520
everyday social services that um

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,360
we could get reliable open street map

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,800
data for all around the world

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,880
and it is very meaningful to be able to

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,240
say that in certain neighborhoods

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,800
but not in others people are able to

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,960
walk

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,560
distances of less than a kilometer in

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,479
order to access these vital services

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,080
the next indicator of walkability which

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,479
unfortunately is not available in cape

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,599
town

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,120
is transit um i'll talk more about that

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,280
in just a minute

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,639
and the final indicator is the presence

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,400
of car free

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:52,240
streets and places we do this using a

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,919
variety of open street map tags um

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,560
but it's meant to include um alleyways

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,280
parks

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,240
plazas car free streets anywhere where

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,400
it would be safe

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,599
for a young child to play in the street

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,840
without risk

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:10,080
of of injury from from a car collision

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,520
um of course the real value of the

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,840
openstreetmap

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,199
it doesn't just give us access to cape

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
town but of course

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,479
there are hundreds even thousands of

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,479
cities

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,479
all around the world that we're able to

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,840
analyze using these methods

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,720
um i'm going to zoom in over here in

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,280
india

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,960
delhi and show you what it looks like

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,599
when we're able to have data for

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,800
transit access these are all of the

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,200
areas within delhi

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,440
where people can walk less than 500

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,680
meters in order to access transit that

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,440
will arrive that will arrive every 10

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,760
minutes or more frequently throughout

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,760
the day

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,399
transit of course sorry supports

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,240
walkability very

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,760
critically by connecting walkable

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,200
neighborhoods to each other

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,200
and allowing people um to

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,120
people without cars to get places that

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,120
they can't really walk too quickly

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,120
and we we do have openstreetmap data

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,080
all around the world including of course

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,800
um

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,399
data is often more accurate or at least

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,720
more available in europe

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,519
um you can see this very impressive

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,839
measurement

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,279
of very many parisians having access to

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,800
frequent transit

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,839
to healthcare and to schools

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,880
um but there are also a number of

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,240
limitations

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,240
uh unfortunately enough

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,600
just a second um before i talk about

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
those limitations i'm sure you might be

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,720
wondering

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,600
um how we process openstreetmap data um

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,000
we use three main sources of open data

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,320
um

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,279
in addition to openstreetmaps

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,320
openstreetmapsplanet.pdf of course

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,200
we call on gtfs that's

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,800
general transit feed specification data

00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,760
this is produced by transit agencies

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,600
around the world and

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,920
aggregated by openmobilitydata.org

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,360
we also reference population density

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,480
information from the global human

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,160
settlement layer

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,160
produced by the european commission

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,600
in order to process openstreetmap data

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,720
we read it into python

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,760
using osm converts

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,200
and then reading it using osm

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,279
nx we then process

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,959
it using a variety of open source

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,360
libraries shapely of course is the most

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,560
important

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,200
and we identify city amenities as i

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,360
showed you

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,160
schools healthcare and car free areas as

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,760
well as the city streets that go into

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,680
helping us understand the walkable

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,800
network to determine which people

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,760
actually have access to schools and

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,760
healthcare

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,000
um it's very important we're not just

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,800
drawing circular buffers

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,040
around schools and healthcare we're

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,480
actually tracing along the open street

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,200
map street networks

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,680
to see what are the walking paths that

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,240
people

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,880
actually follow as they walk from their

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,800
homes

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,399
to these destinations um i

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,399
really welcome you to check out the code

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,279
yourself it's free and open source on

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,600
github

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,560
um the code's not exactly beautiful

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,720
sorry the url

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,640
spells out pedestrians first um

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,480
but i'd love to have your insight on it

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,360
um your suggestions about how we could

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,440
do things better

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
um i'm really not an expert on these

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,160
things and you are

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,440
um i mentioned that there are a few

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,399
problems that we encounter

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,839
using openstreetmap data um the most

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,040
obvious might just be that open street

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,200
map data

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,160
is different quality levels in different

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,000
parts of the world

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,639
um north america and europe often just

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,839
have

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,800
better data than africa or india

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,920
and this can really unfortunately

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,519
propagate a kind of

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,480
unintentional eurocentrism by which

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,079
pedestrians first ends up saying that

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,639
european cities are more

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,639
walkable

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,800
than cities in africa even though cairo

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,040
may be

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,720
just as walkable if not more walkable

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,040
than paris

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,959
but the data just isn't there to

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,320
demonstrate it

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,920
um i've really been wondering lately if

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,040
there's any way to sort of

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,320
adjust our rankings to

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,240
to show the relative

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,320
sort of the the importance of the

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,399
relative levels of data quality and i'd

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,680
love to talk more about that question of

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,959
quantifying openstreetmap accuracy

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,240
after the talk the other limitation of

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,800
course is that we can only measure

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,000
things that have reasonably good data

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,760
so we can measure health care in schools

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,200
but we can't measure child care or

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,880
access to food

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,639
um which are two really really

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,000
fundamental things in making a

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,600
neighborhood walkable because there's

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,839
services that people need to access

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,839
every day of their lives

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,000
sort of a subtler issue

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
and one that's maybe a little more

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,360
difficult to talk about

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,560
is the way that openstreetmap data and

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,360
the model of data reflects car

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,360
normativity

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,560
you know the model was for the most part

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,120
designed and developed by people who own

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,040
or

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,680
have access to cars um

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,399
as they designed the model it reflected

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,120
their

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,519
unconscious assumptions about what a

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,720
city

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,480
is how it's navigated um

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,000
for example streets and roads and

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,360
highways of all kinds

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,839
are represented always and fundamentally

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,040
as

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,120
linear paths that are traversed to get

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,320
from one place to another

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,279
but in many if really not

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,639
all cities around the world streets

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,680
serve

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,639
uh much streets certainly serve a

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,040
function of travel

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,000
but streets that also serve a function

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,639
of

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,920
being a public space streets are where

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,959
children play

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,399
streets are where people come together

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,160
and see their neighbors and talk

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,920
in many parts of the world streets are

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,120
where daily business is conducted

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,600
streets are where you buy

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,600
and sell daily necessities like food

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,519
and because the open street map data

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,240
model

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,760
sort of inherently treats streets as

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,800
linear

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,839
i'm concerned that it misses

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,040
the value that city streets have as

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,040
sites of community

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,560
that doesn't necessarily come out in

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,399
pedestrians first directly

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,120
but i do think it's a really fundamental

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,240
issue that we need to address

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,839
um similarly it's

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,279
very troublesome really that there's no

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,079
single standard for representing

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,519
footpaths

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,959
um whether as parallel ways when i say

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,639
footpads i mean what

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,800
we in the united states call sidewalks

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,920
what people in england call pavements

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,839
um there's no single way of

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,600
of representing them they can be

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,800
represented as tags

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,959
as ways of their own and there are

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,480
sort of different competing ideas about

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,880
how to do that

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,000
um and that

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,399
you know we can write code that

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,959
understands all of those ways

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,560
but it is kind of problematic that

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,079
there's no

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,680
agreement that there's there's not

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,440
really a standard agreement

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,680
um i'm going to talk about informal

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,360
sharing of streets on the next slide

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,399
um and also of uh road crossings

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,000
um so sure it's great right

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,079
as i was saying streets are used for a

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,360
lot more than just

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,120
par travel or travel from one location

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,000
to another and that's true both in the

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,880
developing and

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,320
the developed world um in places like

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,320
the netherlands right there's

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,519
this idea of the shared street which is

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,720
often used tagged using the livingstroop

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,920
highway tag on openstreetmap um

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,399
it's a successful idea um

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,000
and and it's really good for walkability

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
but it also is a concept that's being

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,720
done

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,759
informally in cities all across the

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,959
globe

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,720
and often those locations aren't tagged

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,320
using the living streets

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,320
um identifier

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,800
there's also this question of informal

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,320
pedestrian relations um

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,240
i've got two examples for you this is

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,920
the first one both examples are from

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,079
from my own city of washington dc um

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,279
this street is it's it's really

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,279
important it um

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,800
this sorry this is not the street but

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,640
this this dirt path here

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,559
um because it is what connects

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,520
an entire neighborhood here farragut

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,319
place northeast faraday place northeast

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,160
up to the fort totten metro station and

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,919
so in order to get

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,760
from from this residential neighborhood

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,640
to access transit as people do on a

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,720
daily basis

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,559
they have to follow this third path now

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,439
this path happens to be tagged on

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,439
openstreetmap

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,440
um that's really good it means that it

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,000
can be included as we measure people's

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,320
access to transit and pedestrians first

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,919
but there's this footpath in tysons

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,840
an area of northern virginia in the

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,160
suburbs where there's this

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,600
similarly a dirt footpath which connects

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,039
a transit stop

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,200
to a neighborhood in this case a

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,360
commercial neighborhood a shopping mall

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,480
rather than a residential neighborhood

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,440
um

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,640
and that marker should be here that path

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,520
but it's just not marked on

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,039
openstreetmap

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,520
and so it makes it much much more

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,799
difficult it makes it impossible right

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,440
for us to include the impact of this

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,640
transit

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,039
in terms of um access

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,640
but why is one located in the other knot

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,679
i don't know

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,600
um next question how can we talk about

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,880
safe crossings of streets

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,720
um of course there are there are tags

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,640
there are ways for

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:29,440
crosswalks and for pedestrian overpasses

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:32,799
um but there's not necessarily a

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,720
it's hard for me to understand based

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,440
on the highway tax

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,559
when it is and when it isn't safe for

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,799
people to cross a strict road um

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,200
of course it is a gradation right and

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,720
some streets will be safe for

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,760
you know athletic able-bodied men

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,480
to cross that aren't safe for the

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,520
elderly

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,520
or very young but

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,640
when when the openstreetmap community

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,960
talks about these definitions of streets

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,480
in terms of their capacity and their

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,080
speeds for cars

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,240
we also need to be talking about

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,679
what these designations mean for the

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,120
people who are walking

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,679
alongside or across the same streets and

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,840
i think we need to have

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:28,640
a better understanding of the ways that

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,919
that streets and highways can separate

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,720
as well as connect

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,720
communities um

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,799
so there are a lot of opportunities and

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,440
i don't mean to be overly critical here

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,039
um but i think it is really important

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,919
for us to understand

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,559
how um better pedestrian connectivity

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,360
data

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,320
better amenity location data um better

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,039
understanding of

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,640
what highways in the openstreetmap sense

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,520
mean for pedestrians as well as for

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,600
vehicles

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,080
um and and i really hope to be part of

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,520
these conversations moving forward

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,400
um we of course also have lots of

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,400
opportunities

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,440
at itdp in terms of how we can expand

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,960
pedestrians first

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,960
i'm especially excited about the

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,080
potential for using some form of

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,280
computer vision

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,200
to assess the quality of streets

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,120
sidewalks at the street and neighborhood

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,120
level not only at the city level

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,480
um and i'd love to have conversations

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,120
about any and all of these

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,120
afterward

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,799
first of course i want to thank all of

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,120
the partners and sources of data

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,120
a special thanks to matt box uh for the

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,400
macbox community teams support

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,400
in developing our visualization um

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,600
and the bernard van lier foundation for

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,559
funding this project

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,679
um but most of all thanks to you um

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,480
thanks for your attention thanks for

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,159
your time

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,840
and thanks in advance for all the

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,280
insight that i hope you'll share with me

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,679
during the conversation

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,280
and by email at taylor.rich idtp.org

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,840
have a great time and enjoy the rest of

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,840
the conference thank you

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,679
about the potential

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:18,640
for using some form of computer vision

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,640
to assess the quality of streets

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
sidewalks

00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
is

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,200
okay so um

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,679
so behind some technical issues

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,000
um but yeah

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
um

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:55,840
so um where where

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,039
there's the project currently at the

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:09,840
moment is

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:09,840
it something that's live

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,039
yeah um hi gregory hi um

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,880
audience thank you so much for your time

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,880
the project is not currently live

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,000
we finished sort of processing all the

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,000
data

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:51,840
um

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:51,840
we are

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,080
is hi um

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:48,240
we have data for all cities above 500.

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,159
thousand residents as measured by the

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,120
european commission's urban center

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,360
database

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,360
um

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,279
that definitely includes berlin we're

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:05,039
looking at going smaller but we do start

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,039
running into osm data quality issues

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,720
diversity is smaller than that which

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:29,840
just don't have

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:29,840
any locations of services for example

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,640
um so going a bit into the

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,320
data you're using i don't think you

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,480
covered this but um

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:47,279
have you been using elevation

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,279
genitals factor in walkability

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:57,840
and health

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:11,840
people can walk that's a terrific

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:11,840
question um

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,840
[Music]

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,840
live streaming

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,559
so we do work with our field offices

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,760
around the world

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,720
and try and get their perspectives on

00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,159
what they're looking for in terms of

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,159
measuring walkability but

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,279
it's a very limited

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,240
um sort of test audience and so if you

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,240
have any idea

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:17,440
yes um please i

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,440
asked some questions

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,960
in the pad i would love to hear your

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,960
answers to how you think you could

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:35,840
use heads first in your city or reach

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,840
out to me by email taylor dot

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:51,840
rich resh iddp.org i would love to just

00:27:48,640 --> 00:28:03,840
talk to you about this oh yeah so

00:27:51,840 --> 00:28:03,840
um i'll just read out those questions

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,279
further down can you imagine using

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:17,840
pedestrian first in your city

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,840
if so how

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
uh

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,840
in african cities

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,159
great um no that's that's such an

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:47,840
important

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:47,840
question thank you for the topic

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,440
we can't really do anything with

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,440
openstreetmap data on this as far as i

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,840
know i don't have any

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,840
any

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,240
brilliant ideas um

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,840
we try to address this concern

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,240
when we talk about measuring walkability

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,200
more qualitatively at

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,200
street and neighborhood level

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,760
um with the self-survey tools the

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,279
neighborhood street tools that we also

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:46,880
develop for pedestrians first

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,919
um and we've dpp has also

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,919
released um

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,919
a publication called access for all uh

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,120
that i believe

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,120
addresses some of these issues

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:12,559
it was particularly around gender

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,559
and urban mobility

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:25,840
and that's

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,399
great um yeah it's a great idea i don't

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,559
think itdp has the capacity

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,960
um but i'd be very interested in working

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,919
with you on this

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,440
cool yeah so um that's the questions i

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,720
lost but there's the pad there that

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,840
people can

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,399
uh communicate with you in and i'm sure

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,039
you'll be

00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,519
watching that and posting things um so

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,640
we've

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,640
had a few technical difficulties and uh

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,240
you've done great to sometimes repeat

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,480
your answers um

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,159

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,119
can enter

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,280
