Do you get together with other mappers in your town? Would your group benefit from a bit more support? In this talk you will learn about the newly reformed Local Chapters & Communities Working group and our effort to support mapping groups all over the world.

Attend this talk to learn more about the Local Chapters and Communities Working Group (LCCWG). This talk will share our current initiatives as well as invite ideas from participants, and will precede the annual Local Chapters Congress, so hopefully we'll see you at both! 

Who are the Local Chapters & Communities Working Group? Reformed in November 2019, the LCCWG are a small group of OpenStreetMap enthusiasts and community leaders interested in finding and implementing ways for the Foundation to support the growth of local communities. The LCCWG hopes to facilitate a global exchange of ideas and support among local leaders, and work together to create strong local communities. 

Right now we have 3 focus areas: building local community cohesion, sharing ideas and best practices globally. We hope to encourage established communities to further organise themselves and eventually formally affiliate with the Foundation as one of its Local Chapters. We will review the role of Local Chapters within the Foundation and the interactions between them. Based on our findings we will make recommendations to the Board as to how the affiliation scheme can be improved to provide a stronger case for local communities to eventually become Local Chapters, or possibly suggest creating new affiliation models such as less-formal user groups.

Interested in representing your community on the Working Group? Start by joining the conversation today! Find out more about the LCCWG on the Wiki https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Local_Chapters_and_Communities_Working_Group.

we are welcoming actually not one

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,300
speaker but a whole group of people

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,160
namely the local chapters and community

00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,390
working group of the OpenStreetMap

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,570
foundation and their mission is to

00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,790
improve not only the existing local

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,590
chapters but also make it easier for new

00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,750
chapters to for more on local

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,320
communities to organize them in other

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:38,070
ways and before the start the talk

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,410
launches their screaming there's a pad

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,400
that you can write your questions into

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:47,670
the past inked from the details page on

00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,930
the schedule and after the talk is

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,430
finished we will go through the

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,410
questions that you have come up with

00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,530
hello thanks for joining us today

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,880
my name is Maggie Colley and I am on the

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,070
local chapters and communities working

00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,930
group representing OpenStreetMap us

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,700
you've been involved with at least route

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,310
map for many years now into some

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,579
capacities and I'm happy to be here with

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,100
you at state of the math today today's

00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,840
presentation features seven members of

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,749
the local chapters and communities

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,749
working group talking about what the LCC

00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:22,259
WT does who we are and how you can get

00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:27,270
involved

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,490
Eugene over to you thanks Maggie hello

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,889
everyone my name is Eugene and I am from

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,869
the Philippines I have it mapped in

00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:35,850
OpenStreetMap for almost 13 years now

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,090
and I've been an OpenStreetMap

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,829
foundation member since 2016 currently I

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,810
serve as the chair of the local chapters

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,549
and communities working group and I'm

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,109
here to explain how the working group

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:51,479
came about anyway as we all know

00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:53,270
OpenStreetMap is a global project but

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,350
mappers and volunteers are

00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,719
self-organizing at the local level to

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,149
collaborate with each other and to hold

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,270
events such as workshops marathons and

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,130
mapping parties as an organization with

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,619
a global mission the OpenStreetMap

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,479
foundation may not always be best place

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,270
to reach and support such matters

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:16,110
especially people speaking in languages

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,670
other than English this is the reason

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,490
why the foundation set up the local

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,940
chapters working group for shell cwg in

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:26,790
20:11 this working group was tasked with

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,770
formulating an affiliation scheme to

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,070
support the creation of an recognized

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,320
local chapters the idea is that these

00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,390
local chapters are in the best position

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,800
to support OpenStreetMap at the local

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:43,320
level the LC WG stars was finally done

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,420
in August 2014 when the OpenStreetMap

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,550
Foundation Board approved the template

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,800
agreement that is now signed between

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,620
recognized local chapters and the

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,630
foundation the working group then became

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,620
inactive and has effectively been

00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,150
disbanded since then eight local

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,790
chapters have been recognized by the

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,850
foundation all of them representing

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,190
local communities in Europe I must note

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,590
and in every state of the map since 2016

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,390
there has been a local chapters Congress

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,910
session where representatives of local

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,580
chapters as well as members of other

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,580
local communities meet together to share

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,230
ideas best practices and issues that

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,830
affect local chapters in their mapping

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,600
communities pivotally during the local

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,780
chapters congress at state with the map

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,570
2018 attendees agreed to revive the

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,920
local chapters working group the idea is

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,140
that the working group would provide a

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,060
framework for the foundation to support

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,750
the growth of local chapters and other

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,480
local communities and so in 12 September

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,020
2019 the local chapters and communities

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,330
working group or LC cwg started regular

00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,280
monthly meetings and the OpenStreetMap

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,710
Foundation board approved the relaunch

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,610
of the LCC dollar G as an official

00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:01,530
working group in late 2019 currently we

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,100
have 10 members based in eight countries

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:09,540
spread throughout the world so what

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:11,400
exactly is the ccwg working on well the

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,450
14 group has decided to start focusing

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,580
on three broad aims first building local

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,380
community cohesion

00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,989
we aim to explore and develop ideas for

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,030
the OpenStreetMap foundation to support

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:27,900
the growth of local chapters and local

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:30,450
communities second facilitating a global

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,430
exchange of ideas we aim to provide

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,020
local chapters and local communities we

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,270
have venues and channel

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:40,500
to exchange ideas and share best

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:43,680
practices entered improving the OS MF

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,449
affiliation scheme we aim to review the

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,430
wrote the role of local chapters within

00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:49,860
the foundation and make recommendations

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,530
as to how the affiliation scheme can be

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,389
further improved now that I have given

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,340
you a brief introduction to the local

00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,889
chapters and communities working group a

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,180
few of my colleagues will now share some

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,419
of the things that we have been working

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:08,159
on during the past several months first

00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:10,590
off we had Clifford hi I'm Clifford snow

00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:12,419
from Mount Vernon Washington let me say

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,120
that I'm really disappointed not being

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,949
keep down the person instead you get me

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,099
on video with my koba's lack of a

00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:22,380
haircut for those not familiar Mount

00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,810
Vernon Washington is a mana sized rural

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,680
community located about halfway between

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,599
Seattle and Vancouver British Columbia

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,479
I've been an active mapper since about

00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:35,940
2011 now it's first introduced to

00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,539
OpenStreetMap by hurricane coast

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,400
Steve's much better half as a member of

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,380
the local chapters and community working

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,139
group I'm going to talk a little bit

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,880
about our recent survey we conducted

00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:53,190
with the existing local chapters in

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,990
communities as a new group we want to

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,930
better understand local chapters how

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,360
they are created what benefits that you

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,740
buy from being a local chapter and what

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,159
improvements they would like to see in

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,080
the local chapter agreement we ask from

00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:10,080
input from all the existing local

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,469
chapters as well as those in progress or

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,750
considering applying we have them to

00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:18,150
play the full review of the survey we

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,949
are all volunteer group at for all but

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:26,460
once we are done we plan to share the

00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:29,340
results with the community here are some

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,949
of the key findings from the survey the

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,310
first two are to improve the application

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:37,919
process for new chapters one suggestion

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,289
is to create a checklist of what is

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,630
needed to become a local chapter in

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:44,339
second they recommend having their lead

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,360
on to help Shepherd the community

00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:47,360
through the application process

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,050
local chapters will also like to see

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:53,879
stronger ties with the foundation two

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,940
examples of ways to strengthen the ties

00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:59,060
are to one require that the foundation

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,729
getting input from the local chapters on

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,599
significant issues and secondly better

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:08,759
utilize the existing advisory board

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,400
another key recommendation is for tools

00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,490
to help build communities tools like

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,770
Bryan Desrochers microcosms which allow

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,860
communities to create groups much like

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,880
me neither social media platforms do

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,979
they'd also like to see better

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,590
communication methods to make it easier

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,300
to contact members in the area they also

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,659
need a way to reach in groups of mappers

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,150
not just one mapper at a time they would

00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:35,849
like to standardize ways to welcome new

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,039
mappers in their area finally they have

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:40,889
strongly recommend having a link on the

00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:46,080
OSM website for new mappers to sign up

00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:48,060
through local chapters I was surprised

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,550
to learn that at the time the survey 5

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,940
organizations have a quote conduct with

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:56,520
6/10 process of implementing one census

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,680
survey my own local chapter in the

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,500
United States instance firmly adopted a

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,240
code of conduct if you're interested in

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,330
organization of DOC Unicode contact

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,870
please contact me we'll circle back in a

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,060
bit to talk more about the code conduct

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,860
two other aspects the Democrat

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,419
demographics I found interesting was

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,729
that most reported in the increase in

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,139
membership reason again for the

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,620
increased range from having better

00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,969
internet availability in the country

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,819
using funding to reach out to attract

00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:29,039
new members and to offering a reduced

00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,550
registration fees to attend their

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,469
regional state map conferences once we

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,120
finalize the report local chapters can

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:41,130
learn more about how to attract new

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,529
members finally we asked the one thing

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,110
that the foundation should be doing the

00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,730
simple answer is the local chapters and

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,130
communities are looking for more support

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,250
from help kaneen their application for

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,070
local chapter status approved to be more

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,839
involved with critical decisions to

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,760
financial support through programs like

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,530
the new micro grants program

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,470
the need from financial support varies

00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:08,650
from no help is needed to be a

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:11,050
game-changer there's also call for more

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:14,020
language and cultural diversity along

00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:16,090
with adopting of a code of conduct the

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,710
foundation adopting a code of conduct is

00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,930
outside the scope of our working group

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:24,130
but I trust the foundation will learn

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:27,880
from the wisdom of our local chapters my

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,110
time is up next up is Yoast Thank You

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,060
Clifford

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,710
I am Yoast I'm a co-founder of the

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,440
Belgian OpenStreetMap chapter I'm a

00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,270
volunteer in this working group and

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,690
membership working group and I'm a board

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:43,210
member of the street now foundation this

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,190
working group is there to to learn from

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:48,280
what all the various local groups are

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,790
doing and and try to apply what what can

00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,860
be learned there on the global level so

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:56,470
as one example of an exercise we did is

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,950
a review of the websites of all the

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,450
official local chapters and and this

00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,490
comparison of websites is quite

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,440
interesting because they all have

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,430
basically the same mission and still

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,680
they offer quite diverse solutions to

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,960
the same problem so all over their

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,680
websites focus on helping mappers

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,780
finding the community or or both to help

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,050
Outsiders understand what OpenStreetMap

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,390
is all about it now might be a bit

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,490
surprising but norm of these websites

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,310
are really map centered on some of them

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:34,000
it's even impossible to find an

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:36,130
interactive map there are some cool

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,260
attempts to try and build a complete

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,260
around the map especially the the check

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:45,670
websites is quite use successful at

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,170
doing that they also offer several

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,240
points of complex and and it's

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,680
interesting how some of them offer a

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,080
single point of complex psychic

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,510
communication so that people can send a

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,450
mail and it arrives to several people in

00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,340
the community others focus on just

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:04,120
listing the the community channels and

00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:07,780
some of them do both now this is why

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,670
diversity it shows that there are ever

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,390
so many ways to tell the OpenStreetMap

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,270
story

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,230
most of them offer a striking difference

00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,690
though

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,390
- the the technical looking

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,700
OpenStreetMap Foundation website and the

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:25,450
very mappy website that is open

00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,490
fremantle org in fact the welcome mats

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,280
which is at welcome dot OpenStreetMap

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,200
torque is is the most similar global

00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,090
project or the project that looks most

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:39,550
similar to many of the local chapters

00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:42,160
websites now several of the ids offered

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,530
by the local chapters websites could be

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,660
used to improve the OpenStreetMap org

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:50,200
which is in the end are our main landing

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:53,620
page and and I believe that switching

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,600
OpenStreetMap to dot org to a logic like

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,260
like many of these pages could be

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,540
technically quite simple if we just move

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,540
the current websites to OpenStreetMap

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,360
dot org - map and put a new landing page

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,730
in front of it this landing page could

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,440
then be the glue that binds all the core

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,040
infrastructure and projects together

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,850
even if those projects aren't really or

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,010
SMF projects and themselves this could

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:25,030
look a little similar to the current

00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:27,780
welcome dot 3ml dot org or the wiki dot

00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:31,570
OpenStreetMap toric landing pages

00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:34,600
subdomains and and so things like the

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:38,650
help the the help sites could be more

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:43,410
prominently shown there but it could

00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:47,500
also help to show the local groups and

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:51,130
more prominently and the survey that

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,770
Clifford was just talking about I chose

00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,390
that many of these local groups would

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,940
really like to be more visible on the

00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:01,300
global websites about two-thirds of all

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:05,140
of them really would like us to work on

00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:07,420
that now as a working group what we

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,090
intend to do is to try and build

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:13,000
momentum in the community for these kind

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,530
of changes we want to talk to the

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,810
volunteers who are actually doing this

00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:20,160
programming and to the OpenStreetMap

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:22,750
foundation boards to help facilitate

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,500
projects like these especially if there

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:28,060
is money involved

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:32,290
now over to band four

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:35,250
our next project hello and welcome this

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:38,140
has been presenting the community first

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:41,740
tools part from our presentation taking

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:47,440
over from Yoast okay so let's get

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:50,680
started so why are we why do we feel

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,260
that we need extra tools because the OSM

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,690
website currently if bills for mapping

00:13:53,260 --> 00:14:00,520
but it does not have a lot of facilities

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:04,690
for organizing communities and osm is

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:07,810
only as strong as its community what are

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:11,200
we doing so we are working on two things

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:13,210
so making it easier for local

00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,770
communities to welcome new members and

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:21,130
for community groups to organize on the

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:25,600
OSF website so let's first get started

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:28,780
with welcoming new mappers so what does

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,940
this look like this is the SML Jim

00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:35,530
welcome to as an example there are

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:40,360
others as well but just to let him get a

00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:42,390
feel of how this works so basically you

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,030
walk into the tool I'm logged in here

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:50,410
and you get a list of new mappers for

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:54,550
the day and here for example everyone

00:14:50,410 --> 00:15:00,850
has been welcomed already but we select

00:14:54,550 --> 00:15:03,970
one of this person and here it allows

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:08,290
you to generate a message so we generate

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:10,960
a welcome message and it could be the

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,690
message it sends you to wasn't work you

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,440
paste the message you add a nice subject

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:20,290
to it

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,840
but that something proper and this

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:25,480
message contains in the language that we

00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,570
guesstimate for the mapper depending on

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,000
the region it contains all what they

00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,630
need to know to join offense

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,410
where you take a finite the community

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:42,760
social media and everything related to

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:44,590
to the belgian community basically so

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,120
now this mapper is properly welcome to

00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:53,110
the community and it's up to him/her to

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,610
enjoy or not so what we want to do we

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,940
want to make it easier for communities

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,920
to welcome new mappers even if they

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,440
don't have the resources to set this up

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,830
themselves in this case or that Belgium

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,170
did have the resources to do this but

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,560
not every local community can and we

00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:13,870
want to make it even easier part of this

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,240
is also that way that we would like to

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,570
have the feature to be able to send

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,260
messages via the Horsham API currently

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:26,530
as you saw the workflow is to copy paste

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:28,480
messages into the OSM to work UI it

00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:32,890
would of course be much better if we

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,570
could directly create the messages in

00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,960
the welcoming tool and send them from

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:40,570
there there are also other applications

00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,730
that could benefit from them like for a

00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,790
couple of tasking manager where it has

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,890
to ask for email addresses now to be

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,780
able to send messages and there are

00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:53,770
probably other applications I've heard

00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,430
about that could use this feature so how

00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,770
can you help

00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,020
first of all you can definitely join us

00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,940
in the local chapters and community

00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,329
working group where our nice bunch of

00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:07,510
people so please join and there are more

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:11,079
details in this this issue what is being

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:15,400
worked on in relation to - welcome - so

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:21,069
you're very welcome to join then

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:25,569
secondly an idea by Brian if OSM

00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:27,939
microcosms so this idea is to do add a

00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:29,680
feature to the horizontal world web site

00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:33,760
to allow communities to organize

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:38,500
themselves and to organize events and so

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,630
on this is very attractive to me

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,730
personally because it better reflects

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:45,640
the reality for some communities on the

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:48,880
website it allows the formation of

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,590
geographical or topical groups a lot of

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,529
these groups

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:57,510
nice events monitor changesets and much

00:17:52,529 --> 00:18:00,750
more so here is a screenshot of one of

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:04,289
these examples so here we have an

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:06,360
example mapping deceive microcosm there

00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:10,320
is a description and in this case a

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:14,490
geographical location there organizers

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,260
you can join this group if you're

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,289
interested in it

00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,960
it lists offense recent events and

00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:25,559
upcoming events the existing members and

00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:29,970
here it lists the recent changes in the

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:33,260
general area around around this group so

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:36,059
there is already a demo instance online

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,610
so you feel free to try it out you do

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,770
need to create your new street map

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,980
account for this instance because it's

00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:46,289
completely separate from the existing

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,880
Horsham website but if you create an

00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:50,539
account you can start playing with it

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,250
and get in touch with Brian if you see

00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:56,510
if you see anything that could be better

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,919
or if you see bugs or anything like that

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:02,630
okay so that's about it for the tools

00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:05,960
handing it off to the next person and

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:10,409
thanks so much for listening

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:13,470
thank you been as my name is Rob and I

00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:17,669
have been contributing to a map for

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:20,640
about eight years now within the United

00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:22,860
Kingdom where I live and about two or

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,799
three years ago we decided to set up a

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,370
local community and for the United

00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:31,760
Kingdom to formalize that as a

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:33,840
not-for-profit organisation and to

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,940
affiliate ourselves with the

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,360
OpenStreetMap foundation as what they

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:43,230
call a local chapter I'm I'm also one of

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,120
the directors of that organisation and

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,929
that's exactly what I'm here to talk to

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:53,100
you about is the bishop map foundations

00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:55,529
local chapter scheme what is it what are

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,820
the benefits of it and how do you become

00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:02,789
a local chapter so the very first thing

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,190
to note is there's absolutely no right

00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:08,549
to become established at the local

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,139
chapter but when you do there are a

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:13,739
couple of benefits that come from

00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:16,199
becoming a local chapter the first is

00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:19,349
that status symbol of being able to say

00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:21,449
that you are officially variated and

00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:23,549
obviously you can pass that message on

00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:27,299
to whoever you're engaging with as part

00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:28,919
of your local group however it's public

00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:32,459
sector government body or whether it's

00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,349
organizations or other volunteer mappers

00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:35,759
in your your region named in my view

00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:37,949
impressed by the fact that you're

00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,789
affiliated and they might like to see

00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:45,690
that as part of your dealings with them

00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:49,169
the second main reason is by becoming a

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:51,569
local chapter the oversea map foundation

00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:55,259
grants your rights to use the open

00:20:51,569 --> 00:21:00,149
street mark trademark within your within

00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:02,549
your region so whilst there's no rush to

00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:06,319
becoming a local chapter you should

00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:09,119
start by focusing on becoming the best

00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:12,509
local group and local community that you

00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,849
can be within your region so you want to

00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:18,559
be looking at a set up play a good group

00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:23,940
of local mappers and local contributors

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:28,079
who meet regularly maybe go on some map

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:32,369
phones and you have more members who are

00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:34,109
contributing back to OpenStreetMap and

00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:36,569
what she's to start to build up you get

00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:38,789
to a sort of a critical number of people

00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:41,429
you might want to be going slightly

00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:44,690
further that the next stage from that

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:48,539
informal group of people is to become a

00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:50,279
formal organization and this is a couple

00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:53,249
of reasons might why you might want to

00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,379
become of a formal organization one of

00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:59,759
the main ones is if you want to set up a

00:21:55,379 --> 00:22:02,999
group bank account in order to to deal

00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:07,079
with some money issues like hiring

00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:11,069
venues or buying some shared equipments

00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:13,339
to help you do some mapping the key

00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:15,050
thing when you become a formal

00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:17,300
organization

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:22,820
is that the organization type that you

00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:26,120
set up is a non-profit group and that it

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:28,910
is easy for members to join the group

00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,429
now those two things are important

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,679
because later down the line when you do

00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:35,900
want to become a local chapter those are

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,360
the two main criteria that the OPA sheet

00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,559
map foundation will look out for before

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,300
allowing you to become a local chapter

00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,710
and it's probably a good idea as well

00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,950
when you are going through that process

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:52,610
of setting up a an organization is to

00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:54,559
share the Constitution or the articles

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,740
of association was they're still in

00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:01,429
draft form before we officially set up

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,679
if you share those with with us and with

00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:05,840
lot of OpenStreetMap we'll be able to

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,630
cast an eye over them and look out for

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,700
any obvious issues that might prevent

00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:17,570
you from becoming a local chapter at

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:20,600
some point down the line no and after

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,730
some time you you may have decided that

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,890
yeah it's going well as a good as a

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:27,590
local organization and you now want to

00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:33,800
take that next step to become a an

00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:35,570
official officiated local chapter now

00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,270
when you are ready to become affiliated

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:41,600
and you need to reach out to your sheet

00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:44,720
mat foundation good first point of call

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,370
is probably the board email address and

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,710
from there they can take you on the next

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:52,780
steps as to how to become a local

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,780
chapter of the OpenStreetMap foundation

00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,710
thank you rob

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,770

community cohesion to facilitate global

exchange of ideas but also to improve

00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,740
the local chapters affiliation scheme so

00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,390
that more countries can become local

00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:33,030
chapters joining the local chapters and

00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:36,280

Thank You Jeffrey there are also be a

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,760
virtual local chapters and communities

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,920
Congress this year this is not only for

00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,530
existing local chapters this is a chance

00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,330
for communities around the world to get

00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:28,030
together and talk about community

00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:30,940
organizing around OpenStreetMap and

00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,850
share opportunities challenges and

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,640
trying to solve some problems together

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:38,380
here's a link for a forum that we're

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,590
hoping you will fill out to help us

00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:44,400
narrow down a date for the event and

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:47,260
also we are asking participants to

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,790
record a short introductory video so

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,790
that when we have the event we don't

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,740
spend an hour introducing ourselves and

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,050
we all walk into the virtual room ready

00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:00,040
to go and we already know who's there

00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:02,320
so please fill this out and thank you so

00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,450
much for joining us all today we hope

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,570
you learned something about the LCC WG

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:09,989
and you are excited to get involved a

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,190
big thank you to the organizers for

00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:14,679
putting this together and for holding

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,840
space for us to talk now we look forward

00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,440
to your questions and enjoy the rest of

00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,889
the conference

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,889
thank you

00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:38,860
so there are actually no questions in

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:41,590
the pad just the comment that you've put

00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:44,289
in there about the links from from the

00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,279
chat but could you maybe in question

00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:48,429
from me

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,590
could you outline how you organize your

00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:54,549
work in the working group do you have

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:59,130
like mainly a mailing list or regular

00:26:54,549 --> 00:27:02,980
meetings on virtual I don't know what

00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:07,019
but no phone calls or whatever how do

00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,019
you how does the group actually work

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:25,410
I can jump in a type 1 if you can hear

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:29,400
me yeah it appears that the sort of the

00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:31,410
mixing is kind of we're all we're all

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,300
being streamed right now but yeah you're

00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,690
fine

00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:39,420
yeah okay and we we've tried a few

00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:45,450
different platforms really we've had a

00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:49,770
go at video both ditzy and bigbluebutton

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,840
I think we're we're now 50 back up to an

00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,780
audio only option that on the mumble

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,850
servers and because of bandwidth

00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:00,750
problems in all the different regions

00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:03,630
that where we're trying to cover the

00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:06,690
meetings are monthly I think I'm right

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,980
saying it's it's the times disappeared

00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,200
very quickly over the last few months

00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,540
who will not done but I think it's like

00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:19,770
flu all right and then we've got the

00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:22,950
telegram group for bits in between right

00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:25,860
there's a there's a question being typed

00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:28,590
just as we speak it's not it's not

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:34,170
complete yet no that's that's even

00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:37,680
another couple seconds can someone touch

00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:39,960
on the benefits and issues with having a

00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,720
globalised welcome welcome you standard

00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,080
to these local chapters and these as

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,350
different cultures systems and such may

00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,000
benefit from their eye ability but

00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:54,960
seamlessness might be good I I guess the

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,960
question is about sort of how how how

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,870
much of our standard is there that that

00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,030
is expected or extended to local

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:07,280
chapters and in how far are we

00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:07,280
differing across cultures origins

00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,320
has anyone actually heard me speaking

00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:45,579
yes hello hello Ben yes okay so if it's

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:51,190
about the welcoming part I think I can

00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:55,239
save a few things there so well

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:57,009
currently there is nothing on the well

00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:59,309
there is nothing on the main website to

00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:03,459
welcome new mappers and to actually

00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:05,499
inform them about the fact that osm has

00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:08,379
multiple local communities there is

00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:12,820
nothing really there and how are they

00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:15,909
supposed to discover this so yeah I

00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:19,419
think let's first try and fix that

00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:22,749
problem and then see what kind what type

00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:26,559
of welcoming we should be doing and what

00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:28,209
fits every community right I hope that

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,889
sort of answers the question and I am

00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:37,899
Not sure maybe someone else in the group

00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:42,099
has some thoughts yeah maybe just

00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:45,249
clarify the its though it wouldn't be

00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:47,859
like one global tool to fit all but that

00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:50,320
