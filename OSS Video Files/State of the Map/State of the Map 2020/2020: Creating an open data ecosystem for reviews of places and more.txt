Title: 2020: Creating an open data ecosystem for reviews of places and more
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2020
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/sotm2020-4035-creating-an-open-data-ecosystem-for-reviews-of-places-and-more



We built open-source infrastructure that allows the community to integrate open data reviews of POI into the OpenStreetMap ecosystem. This enables any application or website to make use of a reviews layer, and to benefit from the shared data pool that is created by a combined user base of participating applications. We built it to ensure that people all over the world can freely share their insights about things that matter to them without being confined to proprietary data silos.

Mangrove is a non-profit initiative to create a public space on the Internet where people can freely share insights with each other and make better decisions based on open data. 

Our goal is to create an Open Data Ecosystem for Reviews of places, companies, websites, books, and more. We built open-source infrastructure that enables any application or website to integrate a reviews layer, and to benefit from the shared data pool that is created by a combined user base of participating applications.

In this talk, we are going to introduce to the OpenStreetMap community the technology that is available, and we are going to show how OSM-based projects could benefit from an integration with Mangrove. Furthermore, we are introducing the non-profit Open Reviews Association, ORA, who became the custodian of the Mangrove technology and open dataset. We invite anyone to join as a member in order to shape the direction of the project and help achieve its vision.

in this talk Gina and Peter the funders

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,820
of the open rebuke Association they are

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,250
going to introduce the OpenStreetMap

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,900
community to the technology that is

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,750
available and they are going to show how

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,570
is envious project would benefit from an

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,279
integration with maroon furthermore they

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,949
are introducing the nonprofit of

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,170
brotherhood Association who are a who

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,239
became the custodian of the mangu of

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,910
Technology and comparison they are

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,920
inviting anyone to join them as a member

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,770
in order to save the direction of the

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,200
project and help achieve its mission

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,879
thank you you can go to decision pad and

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,550
a do kickstands and after the live

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,940
stream we will answer all of them to

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,910
Jean and Peter

00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:55,710
[Music]

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,500
so hi everyone my name is Dina Carabas

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,780
and this is Peter Chuang we are the

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,809
founders of the open reviews Association

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,540
and we are quite excited to share with

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,540
you our vision today of creating an open

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,490
data ecosystem for reviews and to invite

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:19,110
the OpenStreetMap community to join this

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:22,530
effort so let's start with how it all

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,200
came about so since a while ago we have

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,619
been using Open Street Map based

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,340
applications like windy maps for hiking

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:36,329
or osmond for navigation in the in the

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,939
city and also we have been contributing

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:42,689
a bit back to Open Street Map trying to

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,880
fill in any any missing bits but we

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,840
noticed that anytime we wanted to find

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,350
for instance a local restaurant we had

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:57,770
to go back to services like Google Maps

00:01:52,350 --> 00:02:01,950
that that that made it easier to to find

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:05,850
for instance restaurants locally and we

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,300
thought about how could how could we

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,220
make it so that so that these

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,440
applications Beit based on open data

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,650
could also serve our

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,480
NEADS in in that case and we noticed

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,720
that the main thing that that was really

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,180
missing were reviews reviews that

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,760
allowed these other services to provide

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,550
us with the most relevant results and

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:35,040
also also see what may be interesting

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:37,260
for us and then of course we started

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,360
thinking also maybe maybe we should

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,450
start contributing reduce to these other

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,750
platforms but because they were

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,460
proprietary and not as open and and also

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,330
we had we would have to give up our

00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:54,560
privacy to for instance Google or

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:58,800
TripAdvisor we thought it wasn't right

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,680
so so that's where the the idea to to

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,430
think about open-open reviews came about

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,790
yeah so let's start by looking at some

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,520
facts about reviews so as most of you

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,470
might also know they have gained quite a

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,140
lot of importance in the last few years

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,300
and depending on the survey and the

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,630
research that you look at around four

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,820
out of five people read reviews before

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,830
they book a hotel online or before they

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,890
choose a restaurant or buy some products

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,140
and furthermore more than half of these

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,030
people also write reviews whether this

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,760
is four because they had a very good

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,590
experience or a very bad experience or

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,080
just because they want to share back and

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:44,370
and contribute their experiences back to

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:47,400
to two other people and finally most

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,080
people trust reviews just much much more

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,209
than they trust any other information

00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,980
put out by the brands and this is also

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,650
what makes them so interesting and so

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,840
valuable for people and as these reviews

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,030
have been have become more more

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,620
important for people they have equally

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,810
become more important for the businesses

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,870
as well and all the places that receive

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,590
reviews that can be local businesses but

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:12,120
also tourism boards or city governments

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,519
nowadays the economic success of

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,919
businesses but also cities or touristic

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,230
destinations really depends on on their

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,390
online reputation and what people say

00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,210
about them on social media and

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,680
especially in reviews then reviews are

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,940
really important for the discoverability

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,130
as well

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,730
without reviews you end up just very low

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,550
on the list displayed to people or you

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,830
are not shown at all and finally this

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,660
data itself also carries a lot of

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,480
opportunities opportunities to improve

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,220
services and products because the

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,230
businesses receive direct feedback from

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,740
their customers what the customers like

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:53,490
how their sentiments also change over

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,470
time and so this can help not only the

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,050
business is improved but also all of us

00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,590
consumers to get better better services

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:04,350
and better products out there now as the

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:07,080
as they are becoming more important it's

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,990
also increasingly problematic in our

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,270
opinion that they are proprietary and

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:17,070
that they are fragmented across several

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:19,680
silos so this is how we know reviews

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,030
today if we want to read them then we

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,970
have to go to either Google or

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,550
TripAdvisor or booking comm where we

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,320
will typically find reviews and and also

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,960
these are the only places where we could

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,130
also contribute to reviews back now for

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,200
other the consumer the issue is that as

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,240
Peter has said before on the one hand we

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,530
need to make concentrators where do we

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,990
want to contribute to and also we will

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,240
see that the ratings for a specific

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,950
place differ quite a lot between the

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,480
different platforms so we also may have

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,960
to make a choice there who do we trust

00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,870
more then for businesses especially in

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,250
the hospitality industry the current

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,460
situation has quite some inefficiencies

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:06,960
in it and also increasing dependence for

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:09,090
for these businesses so on the one hand

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,070
imagine that you have to do we have to

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,440
manage your reputation across all these

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,810
different platforms that's quite a

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,669
burden especially if especially for

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:22,620
smaller places then furthermore the

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,270
businesses cannot use these reviews on

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,160
their own websites they cannot download

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,710
them because they are proprietary to

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,350
Google or Yelp or so so if for some

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:34,650
reason a business gets excluded from a

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,510
platform from Yelp for example then all

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,750
the reputation that they have built up

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,889
on that platform is just gone and

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,449
finally in order to drive

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:44,729
operational improvements that we

00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,289
mentioned before as opportunities it

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,030
would help these businesses quite a lot

00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:49,979
if they could analyze this data in a

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,680
programmatic manner if they could

00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:55,770
download it in real time and analyze it

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,900
across the platforms and really see how

00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,509
maybe also improvement measures that

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,090
they have started actually translated

00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:04,590
into better reviews and right now in the

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,490
current state all this is not possible

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:10,289
for for businesses so if we look at the

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,909
next group entrepreneurs and researchers

00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:14,789
here we see that the current situation

00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:16,680
poses a lot of barriers for them so as

00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:19,139
the data cannot be analyzed

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,930
programmatically there is not much

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:24,270
innovation that can be done unless you

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,639
are one of these platforms so if we

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,860
think about new technologies also

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,810
applications of machine learning to

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,599
build virtual assistants or recommender

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:37,919
systems all of these efforts are are

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,710
limited to those players that are

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,520
already dominant and as people will use

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,680
these services more this platform will

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,250
be become even more even more dominant

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,400
out there and finally also smart cities

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:57,050
or the public in general so on the one

00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,839
hand the reviews are open so are

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,349
provided by consumers freely and free of

00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,300
charge

00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:07,020
to the platforms but on the other hand

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,449
they cannot be used for the public so if

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,349
we think about efforts of some cities to

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:15,529
create new data-driven services for

00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:19,289
their citizens and to improve

00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:23,779
potentially certain services these

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:23,779
valuable data cannot be used for that

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,140
and finally

00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,930
some problems around applications in

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,580
navigation and mapping so here as as

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:37,340
Peter has also mentioned in our own

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:40,580
personal journey this was something that

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:43,790
bothered us most of all so we could not

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:47,810
use our preferred applications in order

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:53,170
to look up a restaurant in a new town or

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:56,840
a tourist attraction or a hotel because

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,910
maps that don't have reviews are just

00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,430
not not able at providing a useful

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:05,290
ranking of search results

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:07,880
useful in the terms of popularity or

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,820
fitting our personal preferences

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,000
so without reviews it's really hard for

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:17,270
new mapping applications or navigation

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,070
apps to create a real alternative to

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:26,030
Google Maps and something that could

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:27,920
really challenge the dominant players so

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,080
we thought a lot about how can we change

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,100
the situation how can we work toward

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,250
something that is similar to what

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,980
OpenStreetMap provides for maps but in

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:43,190
this area of reviews of online customer

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,840
reviews and we thought about an

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,110
architecture that could look something

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,640
like this what you can see here so we

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,970
believe we can build an open data

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,070
ecosystem around this data and at the

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,740
core of it would be the open data set

00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:00,740
very similar to how Open Street Map is

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,260
built as well an open data set to which

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:08,680
different individuals but also companies

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:12,410
can contribute and so in this in this

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:15,140
architecture consumers would not have to

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,300
choose anymore so whether they use an

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,030
mapping application that is part of the

00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,610
ecosystem or whether they visit a

00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:26,180
hotel's website that is part of the of

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,910
the ecosystem or a restaurant or a city

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,010
website or a tourism associations

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,410
website if these websites and

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,030
applications are part of the ecosystem

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,550
all their reviews will be stored in the

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,530
same common and jointly shared data set

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,420
and it will be therefore also then

00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:44,150
available to entrepreneurs and

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:53,210
researchers - to innovate on it and to

00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:57,320
build new services so in order to make

00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:59,360
this this idea of an ecosystem work we

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,880
started working on on two main

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,520
components so on one hand side the

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:08,230
technology infrastructure for open

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:12,520
reviews and on the other hand the the

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:15,430
organization that would facilitate work

00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:19,220
anyone that is interested in this topic

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:22,040
so I will tell a bit more about the

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:25,550
technology on the next slide but we have

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:29,990
we have developed a standard for open

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:34,460
reviews as well as open API and a bunch

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:37,400
of utilities around it and also a web

00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:40,670
app that allows anyone to read and write

00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:44,150
reviews we have also worked a bit on

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:48,050
making sure that that open reviews can

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:50,630
be connected to other link data so so

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:54,950
right now we are working on exposing the

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:58,010
open reviews in turtle format so that so

00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:00,350
that that works and we have also figured

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,570
out the licensing around it so the the

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,310
licensing for the data set itself and

00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:08,390
for any software that is developed

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:11,240
around it and the other important

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,510
component is the Association so it's a

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:18,200
Swiss registered Association and it's

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:21,890
meant to support any efforts around open

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,790
reviews and also be the custodian of the

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:28,250
of the data set and any services that

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,070
are run around it or of course anyone

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:34,220
else is able to house the data sent

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:38,870
themselves but but the foundation that

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:41,750
the Association will be one such spot we

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:44,540
we also have a few different ideas for

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,640
the for the working groups that that

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,870
could be working to contribute to open

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,760
reviews so so far it's research software

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,430
development around the core

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,170
infrastructure and support in inter

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,430
aggression of open reviews into

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:04,070
different services PR and also funding

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,260
for open reviews initiatives and in

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,830
particular the Association is meant to

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,860
be be a vehicle for funding so that if

00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:15,500
there are any projects that require it

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:20,149
they can raise the funding through the

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:23,870
through the Association so now let's

00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:28,190
have a look at the technology that that

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:31,220
we developed so far so there is the open

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,890
standards it's based on a bunch of other

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,760
existing standards you can check it out

00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:39,560
at mangrove dot review slash standard

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,360
it's designed in such a way so that the

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,570
reviews can be easily analyzed

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,050
programmatically and the data set has a

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:52,089
high level of integrity and the reviews

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:56,120
are as useful as possible to anyone

00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:59,900
leveraging them then we have the API

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:03,020
it's an open API that makes it easy to

00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,450
submit reviews through from any

00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,339
application and then retrieve reviews

00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:11,390
according to a number of different

00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:14,570
criteria on top of that API there is a

00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:18,140
JavaScript library that is one possible

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:22,540
way of interacting with it but just this

00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:25,010
JavaScript library also introduces a new

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:28,730
interesting identity solution that makes

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:32,060
it easy for users to leave reviews while

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:34,610
preserving their privacy so this is

00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:38,390
great especially if a given application

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:42,079
does not have any identity solution yet

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:43,640
in place but of course in if the

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,709
solution has it already in place and

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:50,390
then reviews can be left with the

00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:55,190
existing login as well and then finally

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:56,180
the reviews in order to make sense of

00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,209
them

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,950
there has to there there are many

00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,020
different ways to try to make sense of

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,350
them so some reviews may be more

00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,120
relevant some less and one particular

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,870
ways to develop machine learning

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,940
algorithms

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,730
we'll be able to go through the data and

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,279
try to figure out which reviews are more

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,700
important or lessen and so we developed

00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:22,550
one such algorithm to to get started on

00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:26,000
this path and the algorithm based on

00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:30,890
probabilistic programming and it's also

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,720
available on our grid lab and results of

00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:39,670
its computation are accessible through

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:42,560
the through the API so now in order to

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:45,070
to make it a bit more tangible and also

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,339
make it possible to actually leave your

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:52,070
first open and privacy-preserving review

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,810
you can check out the the web

00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:57,800
application that is available at

00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:00,680
mangrove dot reviews and it is meant to

00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,980
be a bit of a demo for the API and also

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,260
the Java Script library but it because

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:11,150
it connects directly to the API it's

00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:13,160
it's a reference it's a reference place

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,410
where where one can access all the

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,160
different reviews while each individual

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:21,500
application integrating with with the

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,700
data set can show a particular cut

00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:28,040
through the data so now I will hand it

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:31,010
over to Dina who tell you a bit more

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:35,209
about how you can get involved in the

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:39,800
initiative and help around spreading the

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:41,779
word about open reviews and also how you

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:48,770
can make use of this technology

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:50,300
alongside OpenStreetMap yeah so overall

00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,700
we think that there are several good

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,290
reasons for Open Street Map based

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,279
projects to look into this technology

00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:01,370
and to think about integrating it just

00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:05,480
to mention a few so on the navigation

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:07,579
and mapping site you can surface much

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,160
more relevant search results for users

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,380
then furthermore you can present users

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,020
with more qualitative information that

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,699
helps them to make better decisions then

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,709
thinking about the points of interest

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,959
you can help those also to gather

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,030
reviews those that don't have them yet

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,220
maybe

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,010
and add value to them by that and

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:31,570
potentially even monetize on such a

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:33,310
dated item and furthermore reviews can

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,650
help as we believe to strengthen

00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,750
communities because they allow people to

00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,430
exchange experiences and insights with

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,440
each other and they don't have to leave

00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:44,140
the platform in order to do so if they

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,360
wish and finally we think that this

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,460
might also be a good vehicle to increase

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,040
diversity and OpenStreetMap community

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,310
because it might attract people that are

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:57,370
not maybe so keen on just adding factual

00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:59,350
data alone but might be more willing to

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:02,200
or more interested in in adding

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:05,980
qualitative data and photos and this

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,530
might be a good entry point for them but

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,660
there are many other ways of how to

00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:13,390
contribute to this initiative if you

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,970
wish so so first to mention is the the

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,950
open reviews Association itself and here

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,020
we invite everyone who is interested to

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,740
become a member and to participate in

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:26,020
the decision-making and in the overall

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,180
direction of the project you can join

00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,940
any of the working groups or you can

00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:33,850
also participate in paid projects if we

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,130
receive grants or if we get commissioned

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:40,300
work by integrators who want paid

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:43,330
support but you can also just contribute

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,250
to the codebase of the technology so you

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,290
can at any point in time discuss with us

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,610
on our riot chat if you think that there

00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,290
are missing features that should be

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,930
added or just make a pull request

00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:55,150
directly to get lab there are a number

00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,250
of areas which might be interesting so

00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:00,400
the standard for instance or the

00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:03,790
cryptography based identity the server

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,550
the api's and then if you have a project

00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:08,740
or if you have a website that could

00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:11,770
benefit from your reviews you can of

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:15,520
course integrate and contribute actual

00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:18,670
data back you can do that in a different

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,030
levels of integration and there will be

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:25,630
always people available to support it to

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:28,990
different extents and finally we hope

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:30,970
that this open reduce ecosystem can be a

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,730
fertile ground for new businesses to be

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,530
created so if you are an entrepreneur or

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,600
a researcher

00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:40,930
we hope that this can contribute to two

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,580
new ideas so be that around building new

00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,790
applications or products or the

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,650
ecosystems such as proof of purchase

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:50,080
verification or solutions that help to

00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:53,230
mirror reviews that are in the open data

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,420
set into proprietary services so that

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,670
people are not disadvantaged as long as

00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,150
we haven't reached a critical mass yet

00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:03,970
or by offering new services such as

00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:09,790
reputation management or consulting to

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:11,680
those that join the ecosystem yeah so we

00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:14,530
are coming to an end of our presentation

00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,270
thank you very much we hope that we

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,150
could share our excitement for this

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:23,740
topic and spark some interest to bring

00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:25,570
more open data to the world yeah visit

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,540
mangroves that reviews to leave your

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:31,060
first review in the open dataset chat

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:34,180
with us on our i/o chat or spread the

00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,820
word on social media and yeah now we

00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,000
look forward to the Q&A with you thanks

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,000
a lot

00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:13,009
thank you guys for the presentation is

00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:14,929
really awful you have lot of text on

00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:16,669
just let's just play you it would answer

00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:18,679
all of them

00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:20,179
so do you want me to read three the

00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,730
first three cake cells and then you

00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:26,450
answer them and then come back okay with

00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:28,909
you we can also go into questions

00:21:26,450 --> 00:22:01,210
because quite a few are around the same

00:21:28,909 --> 00:22:04,700
topics okay so you can go ahead I think

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:07,009
one of the kitchen is all about you know

00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,190
the review of the app it says how can I

00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:12,830
attribute to my app has anyone built an

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,519
app next - mangrove reviews or is it

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,249
Dallas

00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,529
the other one is what exists in open

00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:21,019
function Libya systemic do you examine

00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:24,919
before starting this one why I did not

00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:28,039
adequate so another one is about the

00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:34,749
reliability of data and City Norman's

00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:34,749
users you wanna answer this first yeah

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:40,369
packing yeah yeah maybe missile

00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:43,009
yeah or at least me to my being a stream

00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:48,200
on your site otherwise I think it's I am

00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:50,659
great so so yeah thanks a lot for for

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,799
all the questions there's a bunch of

00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:57,110
them so so there is there is a few

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,570
different topics so the first one around

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:01,700
the reliability so the first question

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:04,700
how can you guarantee reliability of

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,950
data with pseudonymous users and thats

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:10,610
related to dispute resolution

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:14,379
potentially and Gerak's writing videos

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:20,080
and so let's let's go through it so

00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:24,190
generally every review platform has

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:28,120
issues with with with fake reviews or

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:30,640
inaccurate reviews and and a lot of

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:34,360
platforms struggle it with it a lot so

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,370
so I think this is this is the case for

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,640
for every platform and there's there's

00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,970
different ways though how we can handle

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,180
it

00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,950
and so so on one hand side we can we can

00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,370
try to make sure that the data that

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:53,980
comes in today that comes into the

00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:56,920
platform is somehow more we can we can

00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:59,350
figure it figure out from it if the data

00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,080
is reliable and the other thing is we

00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:05,020
can do certain data analysis on the data

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:09,000
as it comes in in order to to figure out

00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:11,740
if if it's reliable so on the kind of

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,570
input points there there is different

00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,000
things forces there existing platforms

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:19,120
oftentimes you need to log in with your

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,420
with your existing login solution and

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,760
that provides a bit of barrier for

00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,890
anyone that wants to spam Forest Service

00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,670
there are some platforms that even

00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:33,730
include with a basically as part of the

00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:35,920
review you somehow confirmed that you

00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,480
made a purchase so so for instance on

00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:41,260
booking.com if you review a particular

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,600
hotel they check if you actually booked

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,460
it through that platform so with open

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,790
reduce we could try to do similar things

00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:52,360
so we could try to for instance allow

00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:54,580
easy creation of kind of a token that

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,560
that people can attach to the radio or

00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,260
for instance if someone leaves a receipt

00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,720
together with a review that can help

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,360
people to determine if this review is

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,830
reliable or not but then that's the

00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,330
first step in terms of the data that

00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,460
comes in but then the other very

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:13,210
important step is looking at the data

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:16,480
itself so there is a lot of really

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:19,000
interesting machine learning techniques

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,970
and statistical techniques that allow

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,180
you to see if for instance a given user

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:28,090
came a given identity came into the

00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,770
platform and only left a few very high

00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:32,269
and very low reviews that didn't

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,250
correspond in any way to

00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:37,669
to the underlying quality of the place

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:40,340
and and then that can flag these reviews

00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:43,250
up as slightly less reliable but if

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,710
someone for with many reviews leaves

00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:48,110
reviews that are aligned with with how

00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:51,380
others see the quality of the different

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:53,360
places then the reviews are more likely

00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:57,260
to be reliable on new places that

00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,110
haven't been reviewed yet so so we on

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,210
their own that analytic site we I

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,510
mentioned this aggregator algorithm so

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,880
it's a kind of a probabilistic algorithm

00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,559
to try to make sense of the of the data

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,840
that comes in and we plan to continue

00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,399
developing it and of course because it's

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,830
open source and the data is open source

00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:18,049
we hope researchers to help us along the

00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,760
way and then there is this other part

00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:22,519
that we didn't tackle yet how the

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,380
references improve the data that comes

00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:28,940
in so attaching any proof of purchase

00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:30,169
and things like that so so far we we add

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,380
that for instance

00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:36,169
pictures of of receipt in to some of the

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,120
reviews but but there's definitely more

00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:41,649
ideas there around even some

00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:46,010
cryptographic schemes around it maybe

00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:48,200
mention we also hope that the community

00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:51,529
itself plays an important role in

00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,559
ensuring reliability so everyone reading

00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:57,019
reviews can either comment on there so

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,690
there are basically two or three buttons

00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:03,169
that a person can can click there so one

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,730
is if you have made the same experience

00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:07,010
if you have been at the same hotel or

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:09,440
restaurant you can say you can click I

00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:13,419
confirm this experience if it matches

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,830
your own then another possibility to add

00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:18,350
qualification to the review is to say

00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:20,899
whether it is a helpful review or not so

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,330
so that patent does not rely on you

00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:26,510
having made the same experience it's

00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:29,419
just asking whether yeah it's a useful

00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:31,820
it's a good piece of information to make

00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:34,159
better decisions and then the third a

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,019
third way of interacting with users just

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,760
to flag them to flag them as

00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:39,769
inappropriate and in the Terms of

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,590
Service we have defined what what in

00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:43,580
appropriateness is and those that are

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,220
flagged as an approach

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:50,300
it will then indeed be read by humans by

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:52,790
by the people responsible for that and

00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,820
then can be moved to another data set

00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:57,200
and one can also comment so so basically

00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,420
all these functionalities are

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,400
implemented in the kind of tech on the

00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:06,980
technology side as just reviews of

00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:08,750
reduce so that all the same kind of rich

00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,900
functionality related to reviews can be

00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:14,870
related to the reviews themselves and

00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:18,280
but for related to what Tina mentioned

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:22,670
and related to the question six about

00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:25,970
arbitration and disputes so generally we

00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:29,920
don't plan to filter reviews in any way

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:32,720
unless they are really violating the

00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,540
violating that Terms of Service so

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,930
unless they are really kind of out there

00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:41,390
and inappropriate and so on but but

00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:45,440
otherwise we want to leave all reduce in

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:47,390
place and and and and rather allow these

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,730
these different methodologies these

00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,740
different algorithms that act on top of

00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,480
the data set to try to make sense of it

00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:57,560
so rather make the data set as

00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,540
comprehensive as possible and then rely

00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,070
on own methods on top of that so on top

00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,410
of that of course there can be manual

00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:05,480
moderation techniques can be kind of

00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:11,090
more algorithmic methods and different

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:14,500
methods but in any in terms of removal

00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:16,790
of the contents which plan to also not

00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,830
kind of remove it and hide it from

00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:21,140
everyone but clearly have a section

00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:23,390
within the data set that has to be

00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,640
separately retrieved with all the

00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:28,820
deleted reviews and the clear

00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:32,180
justification to what what point of the

00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:39,140
of the terms so we answered I think

00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:41,870
number one and number six number number

00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:45,950
five is as in how do you handle the lack

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:49,480
of stable unique identifiers awesome he

00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:53,300
sendeth linked and the other one that is

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,640
linked is does the central open ORV

00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,559
identifier provide out for Android

00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,210
exists

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,879
don't know how Android accounting

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:03,669
setting integration work but it's not

00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:06,940
eating already I'm excited to at least

00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:09,249
look into it some of them are just

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:14,289
comment what type of things are upload

00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:16,799
abused and where can I find more

00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:19,259
information online about affordable

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,059
associations

00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:26,919
tell me about the identifiers it's quite

00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:33,029
interesting and also the one about other

00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:43,389
apps that other review apps yeah so

00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:45,070
let's so which ones okay so wait so one

00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:47,139
I think question three is maybe good

00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:49,960
because it's a kind of a maybe a basic

00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:52,960
question that one might ask so what what

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,690
other existing open with your system to

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,730
examine so indeed we looked at both of

00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,759
the so both of the ones that are

00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,799
mentioned here leap reduce and place we

00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:10,029
open place reduce so that was a project

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:12,549
by the Osmonds guy so so in both we

00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:15,840
didn't see really any other kind of

00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:19,240
picker open reviews efforts or any

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,830
annually but unless they are application

00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,740
specific so we didn't see any kind of

00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:25,570
generic reviews platforms so in terms of

00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:29,110
both of these projects we reached out to

00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:34,690
them when we were starting out our work

00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:38,289
so in terms of reproduce yeah it's a

00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:41,470
it's a quite a nice project it it has a

00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:44,470
slightly different focus so it's it's

00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:48,090
more focused currently on on a curated

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:51,129
community and long-form content and

00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:54,249
certain you we're thinking of even for

00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:56,769
instance as as liberal as reduce our

00:31:54,249 --> 00:32:00,039
left with in the previews maybe adding a

00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:04,360
kind of a a kind of review that links

00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:08,379
back to Lib reduce in mangrove data set

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,760
or in open reviews data set so that so

00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:12,250
that if people want to read

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:17,310
more of a local style radio than they

00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:21,510
can go to reproduce while while mangrove

00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:23,560
reduce remain kind of more kind of

00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,870
similar style wood used to maybe

00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,030
existing with you start to see on video

00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:30,070
platforms out there and a bit more

00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:32,350
structured in terms of their format so

00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:35,860
the previews are also more freeform in

00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:37,660
terms of how they are formatted but

00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:41,740
there is the affinity it's an

00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:44,170
interesting project and and and the

00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,090
reviews in this in Turkey is only refer

00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:49,390
to URLs which obviously you can make

00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:52,540
URLs refer to pretty much anything but

00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:55,270
but they can become application specific

00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:58,450
so forces for place for places we use

00:32:55,270 --> 00:33:01,090
geo uri which is basically coordinates

00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:05,680
and name of the place is and that's a

00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:08,710
fairly generic yeah so that's a fairly

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,960
generic format that allows across

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,730
applications to use in terms of open

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,070
place with you so someone else already

00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:17,110
mentioned below that open place review

00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:19,720
so we looked at it at the beginning that

00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,160
technol so it looks like a great project

00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,190
and we wanted to actually work together

00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:26,980
but the team wasn't so interested at

00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:29,050
that point to work together and also we

00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,390
looked at the technology and use some

00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:34,540
they are trying to build out their own

00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,400
blockchain solution and so there was

00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,350
quite a lot of moving pieces well our

00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,520
focus was to build something a bit more

00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:45,940
simple and streamlined so and by now

00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,710
also the from the conversations in their

00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,570
diagram they mentioned that they were

00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,000
they they are not actively working on

00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,670
the project anymore so so seems like

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,980
it's unfortunately not going more but we

00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,890
are still keen to for a conversation and

00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:06,670
maybe further collaboration so maybe I

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:09,760
will go a bit quicker to let you does

00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:11,909
the time we have so I'm at you on time

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,649
you can read and connect with them

00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:17,230
during the small talks and you can find

00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:19,360
some of them and I know other streams

00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,700
that we have to prepare for analysis

00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,510
thank you so much it was so insightful

00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,240
and years

00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:30,899
thank you thank you very much one place

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,899
you can drop in so it will open place

00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:38,290
yeah that's in there in the pod you can

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,350
drop in into the riot chat so that's a

00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:43,899
good place for kind of asynchronous

00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:45,940
question asking a session so we could

00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:47,500
even face their questions over there and

00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:51,550
answer or we will try to do it in the

00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:55,830
pod as well thank you very much so that

00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,830
