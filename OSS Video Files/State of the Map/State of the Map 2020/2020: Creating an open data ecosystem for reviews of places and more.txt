We built open-source infrastructure that allows the community to integrate open data reviews of POI into the OpenStreetMap ecosystem. This enables any application or website to make use of a reviews layer, and to benefit from the shared data pool that is created by a combined user base of participating applications. We built it to ensure that people all over the world can freely share their insights about things that matter to them without being confined to proprietary data silos.

Mangrove is a non-profit initiative to create a public space on the Internet where people can freely share insights with each other and make better decisions based on open data. 

Our goal is to create an Open Data Ecosystem for Reviews of places, companies, websites, books, and more. We built open-source infrastructure that enables any application or website to integrate a reviews layer, and to benefit from the shared data pool that is created by a combined user base of participating applications.

In this talk, we are going to introduce to the OpenStreetMap community the technology that is available, and we are going to show how OSM-based projects could benefit from an integration with Mangrove. Furthermore, we are introducing the non-profit Open Reviews Association, ORA, who became the custodian of the Mangrove technology and open dataset. We invite anyone to join as a member in order to shape the direction of the project and help achieve its vision.
