Contributors of OpenStreetMap data for Mozambique, a country in Southern Africa, were classified into four distinct groups. The most active group included 25% of all contributors, most of them long-term contributors, and most features were last edited by members of this group. One can therefore conclude that the quality of the data is likely to be good, however, it lacks in completeness and the number of edits per feature is low. Even though no absolute statements about data quality can be made, the analysis provides valuable insight into the quality and can inform efforts to further improve the quality.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) has made it possible for any volunteer to contribute geographic information, regardless of their level of experience or skills. Since the task of creating geographic information is no longer exclusively performed by trained professionals, data quality can be a concern. Uncertainty about the quality of data contributed by volunteers has been cited as a hindrance to its use (Mooney and Morgan, 2015). As the number of OSM contributors continues to grow, gaining knowledge about their characteristics and the kind of data they contribute is important. Data quality can be assessed extrinsically, i.e. against reference datasets, or intrinsically, i.e. by analysing the data itself. OSM data quality has often been assessed extrinsically by comparing it to other reference datasets (Girres and Touya, 2010; Haklay, 2010; Neis et al, 2012; Helbich et al, 2012; Mooney and Corcoran, 2012; Fan et al, 2014; Dorn et al, 2015). However, such reference data is not always available and therefore intrinsic assessment methods have been employed (Anderson et al, 2018; Barron et al, 2014). For example, analysing contributors and their contributions can answer questions, such as: What kind of contributors (e.g. experienced vs newcomers) have worked on the data in the area? In which areas should the data be validated or updated (e.g. where data has been contributed by newer contributors or older non-recurring contributors).

In this study, contributors and their contributions to OSM in Mozambique, a country in Southern Africa, were analysed in order to  gain insight into the quality of the data. We chose Mozambique because in 2019, it received a significant amount of attention in the OSM community following the floods and damages as a result of cyclones Idai and Kenneth. The OSM contributors were characterised in three steps: 1) OSM history data, containing information about the contributors and their contributions, was downloaded; 2) using cluster analysis, OSM contributors were classified according to their contribution characteristics; 3) based on the classification, the OSM data contributors were characterised in Mozambique in order to get insight into the quality of the data. 

OSM history data provides a record of all the edits (or changes) performed on OSM features. Each edit results in an increment in a feature’s version number. Each version of a feature is associated with a contributor (called ‘user’). The results of the cluster analysis revealed four distinct classes of contributors. The most active class of contributors had 2,552 volunteers (25% of all contributors in the area), with on average the highest numbers of changesets, total contributions, node contributions, way contributions and ways and nodes for which they were the last user to modify them. These volunteers are ‘older’ contributors who have sustained their contributions in the Mozambique area over a long period of time, with the first contributions dating back around 15 years. Compared to the other contributors, they have mapped on more days than the others and the average number of edits per feature is higher. Nevertheless, 99.6% of buildings and 84% of ways in the data had been edited twice at most. Buildings are almost entirely concentrated within the centre of Mozambique, in the areas for which the mapathons were conducted. In some European countries, the number of edits per feature is much higher.

Similar to the results of other OSM contribution analyses (Neis and Zipf, 2012), most of the data generated in Mozambique has been contributed by a small group of active contributors who have dedicated a significant amount of time to this. Studies have suggested that such contributors are more likely to be experienced and knowledgeable about the project (Bégin et al, 2013; Budhathoki and Haythornthwaite, 2013; Barron et al, 2014; Yang et al, 2016) and are therefore more likely to produce data that is of good quality (Barron et al, 2014; Yang et al, 2016; Anderson et al, 2018). Even though no absolute statements can be made about the quality of the OSM data for Mozambique, analysing contributors and their contributions provides valuable insight i

this case

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,800
this one towards understanding the

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,879
quality of openstreetmap contributions

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,520
result of an intrinsic

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,080
quality assessment of data from zombique

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,120
click on

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,120
it and on the left side

yes so uh with that we can

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,400
move to uh introducing our speaker

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,840
um so our speaker is

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,040
piwa she's a final year master student

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,800
at the university of victoria um a

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,200
fascination for both geography

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,440
and information technologies have led to

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,800
her pursuing a career in geospatial big

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
data science

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,159
as a data scientist she gets to

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,560
incorporate into her work

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,400
and studies her passion for geography

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,000
and the world around her

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,440
and the analysis of large amounts of

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,879
data in order to extract

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,879
knowledge and insight and insights

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,920
and as we've seen uh talk about

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,720
mapper's behavior today and how

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,959
you can use that to assess the quality

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,799
of

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,360
data so um let's let's hear

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,360
all about it

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,640
good day my name is apio matibidube

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,000
i am a master student at the university

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,000
of pretoria

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,040
and today i will be speaking about my

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,040
research project

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,599
which focuses on understanding the

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,360
quality of openstreetmap contributions

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,799
in mozambique through an intrinsic

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,799
quality assessment approach

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,239
projects such as openstreetmap have made

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,319
it possible

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,439
for anyone to contribute geographic

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,239
information

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,079
regardless of their level of expertise

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
or skills

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
since the task of creating geographic

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,680
information

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,320
is no longer exclusively performed by

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,639
trained

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,600
professionals data quality can be a

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,919
concern

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,759
and has often been cited as a hindrance

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,800
when it comes to the use of this type of

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,280
data

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,680
however data generated through crowd

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,160
tools in projects such as openstreetmap

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
can be a valuable resource for various

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,840
applications and it can help to build

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,840
data gaps

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,759
open street map data has showcased its

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,360
importance for various use cases

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
such as in the case of disaster

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,120
scenarios to aid with disaster

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,040
management and emergency response

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,479
and even with mapping vulnerable

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,400
communities

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,639
and in developing countries where

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,919
spatial data is not always available in

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,320
some areas

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,240
crowdsourced geospatial data can be an

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,560
essential resource

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,400
therefore this kind of geospatial data

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,240
has showcased its importance

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,800
especially in the case of developing

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,240
countries and helping to fill data gaps

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,560
for example the value of street map data

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,600
was recently witnessed in the case of

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
mozambique

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,160
a country in southern africa which was

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,680
devastated by cyclones adai

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,840
and kenneth in early 2019. mozambique

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,560
then received a significant amount of

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,039
attention

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
in the osm community following the

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,520
floods and damages that were caused by

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,080
these cyclones

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,039
osm volunteers banded together to

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,600
generate

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,680
data that would assist to satisfy the

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,320
informational needs of disaster relief

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,320
services

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,080
osm data quality has been the focus of

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
many research projects

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,240
more and more studies have worked on

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,080
gaining a better understanding of the

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,520
quality of the data

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,919
produced by osm contributors and this

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,639
has mostly been done by comparing osm

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,759
data

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,000
with reference data sets this is often

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,639
referred to as extrinsic quality

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,680
assessment

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,479
however this approach of using external

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,639
data

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,160
is not always possible due to

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,400
limitations

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,080
that are associated with the acquisition

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
and use of reference data sets

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,880
these limitations relating to the use of

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,680
reference data are especially applicable

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,000
in the case of developing countries

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,160
as developing countries are often faced

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,720
with a lack of spatial data

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,080
due to various economical as well as

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,680
technological constraints

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,280
so in the current study we decided to

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,199
use an intrinsic approach

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,199
in order to assess osm data

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,360
we examined history data in order to

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,000
determine

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,840
how contributors have contributed over

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,680
time in mozambique

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,680
we believe that knowledge about the

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,880
contribution characteristics of a

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,039
community

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,039
could provide a better understanding of

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,840
the data that is contributed in that

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,080
area

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,840
and help to build insight about data

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,080
quality

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,440
so we essentially want to know how this

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,199
type of analysis

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,960
could help with better understanding the

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,759
state of osm data

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,759
in mozambique

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,160
so the task of characterizing osm

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,759
contributors

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,639
consisted of three steps first

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,560
osm history data was downloaded and used

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,759
to extract information about

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,879
individual contributors next this

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,039
information

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,120
was used to classify contributors

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,759
through cluster analysis

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,879
and based on this cluster solution osm

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,319
contributors

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,319
were then characterized

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,680
so osm history data provides a record of

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,840
all

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,319
edits or changes that have been

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,919
performed on osm by

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,160
contributors these these edits

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,440
result in an increment in a features

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,840
version number

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,440
each version of a feature is associated

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,759
with a contributor

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,159
or a user as it is referred to in the

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,399
osm metadata

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,159
and here we have an example of the

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,519
history records for a node

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,760
with three versions it has been edited

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,279
by three unique contributors

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,600
as can be seen by the user ids

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,640
so this kind of history information can

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,200
be used to create

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,720
contributive focus data which would

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,480
describe the actions of

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,480
each individual contributor

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,959
as we can see here

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,920
an example of this contributor-focused

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,160
information

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,480
which describes how someone has

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,600
contributed over time

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,519
is witnessed for example here we see

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,080
three unique contributors

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,120
and their contribution attributes such

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,560
as the date

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,080
of the first contribution they locked

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,880
their latest contribution

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,640
on how many days they made contributions

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,040
within this time span

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,519
and the total number of their

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,760
contributions

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,320
so other attributes were also determined

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,120
as well for each contributor

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
for example are the total number of

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
contributions

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,519
how many were node contributions how

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,959
many were relation

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,120
contributions how many were weight

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:53,279
contributions and how many were

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,600
creations modifications or deletions

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,800
and another example would be the number

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,440
of contributions

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,120
where the user was the last contributor

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,320
meaning they were associated with the

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,680
very last version

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,959
of an osm feature and this analysis

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,720
resulted in a little over 10 000 unique

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,720
contributors for mozambique

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,600
so this contributor focused information

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,320
was then used for

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,519
the clustering process the particular

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,640
algorithm used

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,200
was k-means k-means clustering is a

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
method

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,440
that groups a set of data points into a

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,240
k number of clusters

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,920
based on their attributes the k-means

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,920
clustering algorithm

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,040
requires that the number of clusters be

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,839
specified

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,519
prior to clustering and this can be done

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,959
in a number of ways

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,120
for this study we used the album method

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,120
and based on this method four clusters

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,240
were determined to be the optimal number

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,160
of clusters

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,800
for the contributor focus data in

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,440
mozambique

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,320
this method uses the within cluster sum

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
of squares

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,880
or the distance between or the distance

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,800
between points in a cluster

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,640
to determine an optimal number of

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,640
clusters for the data set

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,640
but before contributors could be

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,839
classified

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,839
or before this contributed data could be

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,120
used for cluster analysis

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,920
some data preprocessing was necessary

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,880
first feature scaling was applied

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,360
feature scaling

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,600
is the process of normalizing the data

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,160
in order to ensure attributes

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,640
are on the same scale this was done

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,040
because

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,800
k means is a distance based machine

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,680
learning algorithm

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,920
which means it can be affected by scale

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,640
and the second form of pre-processing

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,880
was principal component analysis

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,079
which is a dimensionality reduction

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,200
technique

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,200
dimensionality reduction was applied to

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,279
help make the interpretational and

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,600
visualization of the results

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,639
simpler and to reduce the computation

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,639
time of clustering

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,120
so an iterative process was used in

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,360
order to determine

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,560
how many principal components would be

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,040
beneficial for the clustering algorithm

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,760
various principal component solutions

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,760
were used

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,320
for cluster analysis and then they were

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,560
visualized as can be seen in the

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,200
in this image as we can see

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,040
from the very first image the first

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,800
three principal components

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,760
help the clustering algorithm to

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,920
differentiate between the four clusters

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,760
so the first three principal components

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,160
provide information that helps

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,720
differentiate between the clusters

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,680
however as we added more principal

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,800
components

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,279
they did not provide much information

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,480
that helped with differentiating between

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,440
clusters

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,160
so ultimately a three principal

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,240
component

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,760
cluster a three principal component

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,639
solution was chosen

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,480
to describe the contribution attributes

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,560
for each user

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,560
these principal component values were

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
then used for the clustering process

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,920
this table summarizes the final clusters

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,760
the final tester solution

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,480
and displays the number of contributors

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,880
that are associated with each cluster

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,760
so the k-means clustering algorithm

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,240
classified

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,440
each contributor into one of four

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,519
clusters

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
based on three principal component

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,839
values that were used to explain each

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,399
contributor

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,480
so the clustering algorithm divided the

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,199
contributors in mozambique into four

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,959
groups

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,839
based on how they had essentially

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,839
contributed over time in the area

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
so we went back to the original data set

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,760
of attributes and in order to better

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,639
understand the clusters that had been

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,079
produced

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,480
some statistics were then calculated

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,920
so the average number of mapping days

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,040
change sets as well as total

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,000
contributions

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,519
were determined for each cluster and

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,720
from these results

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,000
we can see that cluster 4 is the easiest

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,880
to pick out

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,480
as it has the highest averages so we can

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,600
immediately see that this cluster

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,800
represents the most

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,399
active contributors so this was

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,480
essentially the easiest cluster to

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,440
characterize

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,440
upon further inspection of the data we

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,600
came to the following conclusions about

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,800
the remaining clusters

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,240
cluster one appears to mostly consist of

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,639
contributors that

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,959
have older contributions and who have

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,760
not continued to contribute data over

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,320
time

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,839
these contributors have a low number of

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,440
mapping days

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,760
as well as a low number of total

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,839
contributions so this cluster

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,040
appears to represent non-recurring

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,480
contributions

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,720
cluster 2 consists of contributors

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,560
who have not been very productive during

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,519
their time

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,399
on openstreetmap so these contributors

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,880
mostly have

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,399
a low number of change sets and total

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,639
contributions

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,160
and even contributors in this cluster

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,199
with more mapping days

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,800
do not have many contributions so the

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,360
contributors in this cluster

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,240
appear to be the least productive on

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,600
average

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,519
and we can see this because the average

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,519
number of changes as well as the average

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,399
number of contributions is the lowest

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,399
for cluster 2.

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,959
cluster 3 consists of contributors who

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,000
have been east

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,160
who have been active recently

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,040
so this could represent newcomers

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,839
perhaps

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,880
because these contributors do not have

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,279
very many

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,160
mapping days but they have the second

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,639
highest number

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,440
of osm features where they have been

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,399
classified

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,639
as the last contributor and this is

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,519
second of course to the

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,519
cluster four so cluster three and

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,519
cluster four

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,880
appear to be the clusters that are

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,440
associated

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,920
mostly with the latest version of osm

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,920
features

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,440
so the results appear to show us that

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,759
most of the work is done by a small

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,040
percentage of contributors

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,519
which is mainly cluster four cluster

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,000
four

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,360
accounts for about only a quarter of the

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,680
total contributors but about 93

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,880
of all contributions are associated with

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,160
this cluster

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,839
followed by about about five percent

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,240
of the remaining contributions are

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,279
associated with contributors from

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,519
cluster three which is the newcomers

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,519
this makes up 98 of all contributions

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,440
while the remaining clusters which are

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,519
cluster 1 and 2

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,160
have almost no impact so

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,439
so these results are in line with the

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,319
participation

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,799
inequality that has often been witnessed

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,240
with

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:17,360
osm communities we also

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,000
see that the resulting clusters could

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,640
have been

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,400
influenced by the recent disaster

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,600
mapping efforts

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,280
for example cluster 4

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,520
which is the most active set of

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,360
contributors

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,039
does not only have long-term

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,360
contributors

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,640
but they are also contributors with just

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,679
a few mapping days

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,760
but a high number of contributions

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,400
this can mostly be seen during the

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,919
disaster activation mapping period

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,360
in early 2019 so some contributors have

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,280
managed to produce

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,120
thousands of contributions in a short

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,880
span of time

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,640
this pattern is also witnessed with

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,280
cluster 3

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,000
which is the cluster of newcomers and

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,840
the second most active cluster

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
this cluster seems to be made up of

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,840
mostly recent contributors

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
and some of the contributors in this

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,600
cluster are most

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,840
probably a result of the recent

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,840
activation mapping efforts

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,000
what we can also say is that osm data in

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,320
mozambique

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,919
appears to still be in the early stages

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,880
of development

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,880
most areas have been mapped have not

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,120
been mapped in detail

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,480
and so it appears that volunteers have

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,679
focused on

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,679
building a base map

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,919
so what kind of questions could this

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,000
type of analysis help us to answer

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,320
while it could give us information about

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,280
the progression of osm data

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,320
in an area for example what kind of

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,200
contributors

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,320
have worked on specific osm features in

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,240
that area

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,720
is it newcomers or is it experienced

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,880
contributors

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:08,000
and this could help with identifying

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,880
areas that might need to be validated or

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
even

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,320
updated so it could help with

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
identifying stale data

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,360
where for example the last known

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,080
contributor

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,039
was a non-recurring contributor who has

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,480
not been active

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:26,000
for a long time so

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,919
in conclusion the results of the study

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,120
show how one can gain a better

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,799
understanding

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,480
of the community that tends to

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,799
contribute by inspecting history data

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,480
and this can help with building insight

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,640
about data quality

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,919
and help to identify areas that might

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,919
meet data validation

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,840
thank you

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,799
okay we're about to go live next for my

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,840
friends

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,840
yes all right

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:29,120
okay so uh thank you for

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,400
a very interesting talk let's get some

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,440
some uh interest in the question pad so

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,120
uh godwin please leave the queen

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,000
for a second all right okay thank you

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,600
very much yeah

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,520
um hello everyone my name is godwin

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,360
and um and uh i'm

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,039
carrying this session with uh with the

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,159
art and so i will um

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,480
take over the uh moderation of the of

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,520
the

00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,960
q a um i've seen

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,400
several um interesting uh questions

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,880
coming up um first of all thank you very

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,120
much

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,480
um happywave for the excellent

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,080
presentation

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,919
and i can see uh you have had um

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,280
a lot of people have had uh interest in

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,960
this study and

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,360
i can see about 23 people in attendance

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,840
oh it was 23 it's now 22.

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,000
um so um there are some comments here

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,280
i'll start with the comments um

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,440
from one from yagura station

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:36,640
he says um who says uh wow awesome work

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,120
um the other face um

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,880
there's no name here really interesting

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,840
analysis based upon the classroom of

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,760
users

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,679
it reflects other studies i have seen

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,280
from other uh

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,360
other studies with three contributors

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,080
adding much data

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,200
um i have my own questions but i think

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,280
uh depending on time

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,960
um i will go through the ones on the

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,760
session part

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,240
so there's one from cameroon cameron

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,200
green

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,919
and he's asking how would your results

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,159
be

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,080
when compared to other well-mapped areas

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,720
in africa such as

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,520
tanzania and i think this is related to

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,840
um

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,200
probably in my mind what you talked

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,640
about in terms of the

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,039
participation and quality and other

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,720
aspects so probably i'll leave it to you

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,000
a few way to

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,159
address this question um

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,440
thank you godwin and uh first of all

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,280
thank you for um

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,559
to everyone who actually tuned in and

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,280
listened and

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,679
thanks for the interesting questions so

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,880
um

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,679
to get back to this question i think um

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,320
what is different about what i've

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,320
witnessed

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:47,440
anyway in mozambique is that

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,919
most areas have not been mapped in

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,520
detail

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,559
as i said so it's basically the

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:58,159
base map that volunteers have um

00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:00,400
aimed to finish so as i mentioned

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,200
there's only one to two versions of most

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,679
features

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,360
which i think differs in terms of some

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,000
other places are

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,799
better mapped where there is more detail

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,760
in other

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,039
countries or other places but um since

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,400
we did not

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,440
perhaps um analyze a smaller portion or

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,480
maybe where

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,240
um youth mappers or some

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,000
or some mappings have been focused in

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,600
mozambique maybe we would have seen a

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,799
different pattern but since

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,200
we took the whole country i think this

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,440
just

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,440
shows that the state of development in

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,840
terms of mapping is still

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,840
at quite a new at quite a new stage

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,640
brilliant uh thank you very much um i

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,880
think yeah this will set the stage for

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,760
federal comparative studies uh regarding

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,799
uh this question

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,360
um the next question um is about which

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,880
technique do you think is most um

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,600
useful to help in the uh intrinsic um

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,600
interesting studies um i think you might

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,880
you i think your study was about k-means

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,919
and others so um i think this

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,080
guy is pointing to pca i think principal

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,200
component analysis and things like that

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,480
um so what do you think about that

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,400
um i think a combination because i use a

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,640
combination of them both

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,960
principal component analysis as well

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,840
k-means clustering but the pca

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,679
was more so to narrow down the variables

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,760
to their principal components so it

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,880
could be easier to understand what

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,640
what each cluster represented because if

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,960
we went with all of the

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,400
20 or so variables it was going to be

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,960
harder to explain

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,520
what each of the clusters represented so

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,720
i think

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,960
a combination of actually um all the

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,480
analysis techniques that were used i

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,840
think they all played a part

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,960
in the final results

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,440
brilliant thank you very much um another

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,559
question

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,600
from greg rose was there an

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,880
effort to plot cluster member cluster

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,080
member mapping against

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,520
automated error findings such as uh

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,600
keep right or most

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,640
osmose or something like that i don't

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,880
know whether you're aware of these

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,000
these stamps and that is to find errors

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,559
in marketing tied to

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,600
specific clusters anyway he says great

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,720
job

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,400
please address uh no um

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:28,000
i don't think the study really um

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,919
actually did that so uh yeah we didn't

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,760
make an effort to do that

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,960
yeah probably a good idea for future

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,080
work

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,080
yes i would say so brilliant um

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,440
thanks greg also for the question um the

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,120
next question um

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,799
is about um i think it's from um

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,559
the odin um the uh previous present one

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,360
of the previous presenters um did you

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,080
try out

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,919
other clustering methods aside from uh

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,200
k-means uh interesting it's like i do

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,400
read my mind because i have this

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,440
question here

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,240
can you explain more about your um your

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,720
reasoning

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,400
for using a parametric based classroom

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,440
method over a density based

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,480
classroom method um

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,600
well oh okay um i

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,840
actually did not um we actually didn't

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,799
try um other clustering methods

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,200
and honestly to say it's because um

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,080
k-means was the clustering method that

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,120
i was um most knowledgeable

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,000
knowledgeable about

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,960
and familiar with and since it is such a

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,919
simple

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,120
um it's simpler to understand um this is

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,960
the clustering method i

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,840
i went with i think it would need a bit

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,640
more in-depth knowledge to perhaps try

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,000
um other clustering methods

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,120
oh brilliant thank you very much and um

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,840
also i think there's no oh thank you adi

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,640
also for that

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,400
um the last question um on the part is

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,000
will you be continuing with this study

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,000
or is the project now complete

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,919
i think it is um

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,120
well from my side i would say it's not

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,000
complete

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,799
um i think there could be potential for

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,520
future work

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,200
but i'm not sure yet whether i would

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,640
choose to continue with the study but i

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,799
think it has

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,480
unveiled some interesting things that

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,200
could be looked at in terms of future

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,840
work

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,840
because um in terms of looking at

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,760
mozambique we say that

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,360
most of the work is done by the most

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,000
active contributors

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,919
and we assume that these contributors

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
actually contribute good information but

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,559
this is mostly based on assumption

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,399
that other papers have also said that we

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,760
assume that someone who's experienced

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:45,039
has good good contributions but

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,520
this hypothesis has not been tested so i

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,559
think

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,840
future work could also look in testing

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,320
um could we see a difference from

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,080
data contributions of newcomers versus

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,840
experienced contributors

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,520
and um is this actually a valid

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,640
um is this a valid assumption to make

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,320
then this would be um um it would be

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,320
more justified to say that

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,919
experienced contributors actually

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,840
contribute good information

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,000
once we've actually looked more into

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,320
this

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,159
brilliant um thank you very much i think

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,080
we still have some time

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,159
so i will jump into some of the

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,480
questions i have myself

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,200
um oh no i think there's another one

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,840
here

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:35,200
on the pad um

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,080
so that this is about special data is

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,600
from stefan

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,760
stefan this is a german special uh

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,799
special data quality has five elements

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,880
according to

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,039
a certain i think a certain link i've

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,520
not gone there yet but the question is

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,200
on what data quality element are you

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,320
after completeness

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,880
or something else accuracy positional

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,640
thematic accuracies uh personal crisis

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,360
all sort of completeness indicators

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,240
also and other indicators so indicators

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,320
of quality

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,480
so which one are you really um

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,120
interested in

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,640
um i think that is based on a

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,799
case-to-case basis

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,320
here we were also looking at intrinsic

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,440
quality measures so

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,919
those are um those quality measures that

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
are all

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,760
just mentioned are more so used when you

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,279
are using reference data

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,000
and you using extrinsic or external data

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,279
to compare

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,159
what is happening so i think um

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,720
that is more on a case-to-case basis if

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,080
you were

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,120
to further um decide

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,880
what kind of uh quality you'd want to

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,799
assess in mozambique then you could

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,840
choose based on

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,520
those specific elements as i said in

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,520
future work if you were to actually

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,600
assess the data and see

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,279
does this actually correspond that

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,679
experience contributors

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,799
um contribute good information then you

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,039
could perhaps start

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,799
to decide um would we want to look at

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,840
completeness or would you want to look

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,799
at the magnetic

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,480
accuracy and so forth but with intrinsic

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,080
quality assessment i think

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,919
it's more of a basic statement to say

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,919
we assume because these people are

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,720
knowledgeable with openstreetmap

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,679
that they know what they're doing

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,200
excellent brilliant

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,039
i think the way you put it actually even

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,520
sparkled another question in my mind

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,159
that is about um experience so you said

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,600
um

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,200
so i'm thinking about what when you say

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,799
experienced markers what do you mean

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,520
what do you have in mind uh from your

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,840
study and also generally

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,559
um i would say with experienced mappers

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,000
from

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:41,279
my study and in general is uh

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,480
people who first of all have experience

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,200
with contributing

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,520
in general and osm so but we only looked

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,760
at mozambique so we can only speak for

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,240
their contributions in mozambique so for

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,640
example people who have at least

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,840
um some practice with contributing

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,120
whether it be

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,720
um a week but it's not um

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,480
it's not a week in terms of they only

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,360
contributed within one week but their

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,720
days add up to let's say seven days or

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,600
some people even

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,440
um have a hundred and something days

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,960
split um that have been

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,200
um split over for years for example

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,399
so i think experience is how much you've

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,799
been practicing

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,320
and how much you know about contributing

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:26,240
towards the osm project

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,640
that is um what experience is

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,960
brilliant thank you very much um i have

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,399
another question here um

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,159
it was interesting to hear about the

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,360
concept of participation

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,240
um inequality and i was wondering what

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,279
do you think about

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,760
um what do you think awesome community

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,279
can do

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,279
uh to increase participation

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,440
um i think raise awareness as well

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,120
perhaps because i think this is a bit of

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,799
a tricky question

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,480
because this whole participation

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,399
inequality thing is not

00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,519
only witnessed in mozambique but in

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,080
terms of

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,960
other online communities as well where

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,840
um it's

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,480
mostly up to people the most interested

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,320
group

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,080
and just a small number of people who

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,159
are interested in actually furthering

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,360
the data and contributing

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,679
so um i think things like

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,360
um trying to reach out to the community

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,159
and making them understand

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,960
why this type of mapping is taking place

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,080
would help

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,320
sort of uh uh

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,200
reach more people who would perhaps be

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,559
interested in

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,519
um mapping but this is also a research

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,039
question as to why people keep mapping

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,880
versus why people

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,880
some people only map for a few days

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,360
maybe even a day then they decide

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,240
hey i'm done i'm not gonna map anymore

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,679
so

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,960
and i think that is also a research

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,679
question of its

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,679
own as to um why are the dedicated

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,440
members versus people who don't continue

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,120
mapping over time

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,039
yeah very interesting yeah you could

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,640
even look into you know the

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,799
participation as to volunteer

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,679
participation and then also paid

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,240
uh commercial participation in a way um

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,200
anyway

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,080
thanks a lot uh for that um so i have

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,440
another one here

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,600
uh regarding the uh contribution uh

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,279
the analysis regarding the contributors

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,120
so did you consider the time of uh

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,159
registration by contributors to join

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,919
um openstreetmap

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,200
uh no actually um i think since we only

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,880
looked at data that

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,039
um concerned the mozambique area

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,880
so we looked at how long they've been

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,080
contributing in that specific area but

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,519
we did not

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,519
um look at uh how long the user has

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,840
actually been registered which is i

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,320
would say a weakness of the study

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,200
for um example because people who are

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,120
considered

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,399
newcomers in mozambique might not

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,799
necessarily be

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,080
newcomers to the openstreetmap project i

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,799
think that would need

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,440
um analysis of the whole database which

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,000
is

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,559
um quite intensive and would need

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
definitely more computing power

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,919
brilliant i think in your case the new

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,320
commerce was in terms of the mapping

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,320
days

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,960
isn't it yes and also um

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,520
how because local mappers might know

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,720
more about mozambique versus people

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,240
who are who haven't met their people so

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,159
you could say they're just newcomers in

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,480
mozambique in terms of they've never met

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,560
that area so they know that they might

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,679
know less about it

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,800
i see brilliant um i saw also the i

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,040
think in terms of

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,240
the temporal analysis you looked at um

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,599
according to me if i'm wrong but i think

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,879
you looked at uh

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:42,720
2016 to 2019 right

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:46,000
yes and that's why quite this period

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,760
uh okay well this is because um

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,200
in terms of the history data the history

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,359
data has um

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,040
a record of all the contributions that

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,440
have been made in mozambique

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,440
and the first ever contribution that we

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,960
could track from the history data was in

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,320
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,000
so that is how we determine the um the

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,040
first date it's from the first ever

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,240
contribution

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,280
and then um 2019 why we decided to

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,359
we looked until i think about mid-2019

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,119
which is when i extracted the data and

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,680
started the analysis

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,800
so this was also influenced by the

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,720
recent

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,400
disaster scenarios that happened where

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,359
we wanted to see

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,200
how this also influences the mapping

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,160
patterns

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,760
oh brilliant thank you very much um i

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,520
have another here

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,440
i think i was thinking about the k-means

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,720
clustering and your definition of

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,920
distance here

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,440
and um what when you say distance

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,240
what do you mean exactly um

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,640
as far as i know k means clustering uses

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,079
um

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,880
euclidean distance if i'm not mistaken

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,320
yes

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,160
okay brilliant thanks a lot and i was

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,839
wondering you know the whether

00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:00,160
um uh it's possible also to consider

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,520
you know the network distance uh because

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,839
it's not always the case that you know

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,040
uh

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,680
where you have the validated um road

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,599
network

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,599
you know then you could use a distance

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,240
as an input to the

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,920
to the algorithm to sort of compute the

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,160
clusters

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,400
i don't know whether you came to mind or

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,880
you considered that

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,800
i have to say i did not consider it i

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,320
think that would also need more research

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,560
in terms of figuring out um

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,000
how this different distance measures

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,040
would um affect

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,640
k means because um euclidean distance is

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,040
sort of the default

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,160
that is used but i'm not sure whether

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,680
you can actually

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,359
choose to use different distance

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,320
measures so that would need further

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,800
research

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,040
yeah brilliant thanks a lot um i think

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,720
the i have one last question

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,640
i think we don't have any more so i'll

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,520
just ask this last question and we're

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,520
almost there

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,960
um so the issue is about i think the

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,720
general one which is about the

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,040
your experience about working with

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,119
history data or some history data

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,720
and what sort of challenges did you find

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,400
uh in terms of you know

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,160
extracting it analyzing it and to

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,839
getting the results that you presented

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,880
nicely to us

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:16,800
i would say it's definitely um

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,200
a lot of data to work with so you would

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,200
need a lot of computing power because i

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,680
only worked with mozambique data so i

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,400
can

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,960
only imagine if you would be tossed with

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,880
um

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,040
having to work with for instance the

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,680
whole openstreetmap database

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,920
if you were interested in the whole user

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,280
the whole contributing community so

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,160
um analysis did take quite some time

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,440
because

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,040
of the because of how much data um was

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,359
involved

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,280
okay brilliant thank you very much for

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,079
this excellent presentation

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,440
um i've learned a lot and i hope all of

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,920
you who are uh

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,720
listening have also learned a lot um and

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,680
thank you all

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,359
um this will come to a close and uh i

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,839
hope you enjoy the rest of the

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,839
conference thank you everyone thank you

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,839
