https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/T077-Improving_OSMCha_for_the_community/

Any collaborative project needs to care about reviewing the contributions in order to maintain the quality of the data. OSMCha is one of the main OpenStreetMap quality assurance tools, it gives us a powerful interface to visualize a changeset and allows us to register if the changeset is good or if it causes some problem to the map. In 2018, our focus is to increment OSMCha with the features wished by the OSM community and engage more people to validate the map.

In this talk, weâ€™ll give an introduction about how OSMCha works and share the vision we have for its future.

thank you I'm really so ugly to start

00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:16,480
saying thank you to everyone that is the

00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:18,730
organizing team I have organized six of

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,460
them are Latino America so I know how

00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,599
hard it is to make this event happen so

00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,990
thank you very much

00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:28,089
and I would like also to say thank you

00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,150
for everyone that is contributing to a

00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:34,000
piece of map it's project have provided

00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:37,000
me a lot of good moments mapping a lot

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,940
of trends over the world so thank you

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,170
everyone so let's start I am a software

00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:52,629
developer I am marking opposite Matt

00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:54,100
since 2010 and more or less September of

00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:59,079
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:02,739
I created the or simcha and since the

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:08,710
beginning of 2017 I have been walking or

00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:13,510
SME cha with the support of my bugs my

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:17,950
bugs start using the simcha so most ago

00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,780
some of software I created it mainly

00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:24,420
because

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:27,250
Sanjay Bunga that is a that was our

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:34,810
person that worked from our BOTS in

00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:37,630
India so how did it begin I was always

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:41,860
like worried about the data quality in

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:45,520
the opposite map I I was always like

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:49,690
monitoring the sheets in the place where

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:53,580
I was a teaching so I used a lot a to

00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:58,690
mage by Pascal nice or semi stats

00:01:53,580 --> 00:02:02,430
extremists at give us a lot of charts

00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:05,950
and statutes it's the cheese kids about

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,099
opposite map so in this chart for

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,219
example you have the number of nodes

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:15,940
created modified in the little in every

00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:19,480
day in that case it's Brazil but

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:24,220
i sim starts have starts about all the

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:27,940
counters so how you can see there are

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:32,800
some peaks of idiots and I always saw

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:36,760
that Peaks it lets some questions like

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,660
what happened to have that big was each

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,360
our own import who has imported data

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:46,140
with data was botched we had a lot of

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:51,030
problems with illegal imports in Brazil

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:53,710
so we didn't have a - to easily find

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:58,510
which I did Scouts that imports for

00:02:53,710 --> 00:03:03,160
example or which I did scald the big

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:07,630
data or emotional they mean - that you

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,880
had in that time was who did it with who

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:15,760
did it you can feel today the change

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:17,740
sets in some area the time I think you

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:25,060
cannot feel the more than one month or

00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:27,490
more then smooth but it's a nice - but

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,920
if you have a lot of edits I begin about

00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:36,220
headaches it should be very difficult to

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:38,650
find the change that that you need and

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:42,370
also it does not classify the edges that

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,470
you have so you need to check change

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:50,260
that by chin sides to find something

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:52,810
wrong so my main purpose when I create

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,360
your simcha was to a lowers to filter

00:03:52,810 --> 00:04:00,490
chain sets in to detect humphrey'd it's

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:03,820
faster I not that so make some bad

00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:08,230
elements was the map for a long time so

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:12,640
I'd like to reduce the time that the

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:16,000
darrell's remain in opposite map that

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,850
was the first version of a simcha

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,780
we had like a table view with a list of

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:26,200
change set in some information about the

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:29,080
change sets like the number of objects

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,849
create much file deleted the reason why

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:38,189
that

00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:42,959
to use use consider suspect we had some

00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:46,619
filters so you could search change that

00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:51,240
by some parameters or viable boards for

00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:53,849
example to find in certain area that it

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,449
was the the look of the change at page

00:04:53,849 --> 00:05:02,580
we had like our solid section of the

00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:06,599
chain set provided by HIV in the other

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:11,129
information about the chain sites so in

00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:15,719
the beginning of 2017 my box contacted

00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:21,269
me to to do a redesign process with the

00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:25,259
map box scheme that process was we have

00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:28,529
done some using to views we've have

00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:31,019
users of a simcha and with the map box

00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:34,409
did the team that was using a simcha a

00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:37,619
lot we have identified some key

00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:40,139
operations and components or same

00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:44,430
charted the most important actions that

00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:49,379
the user was doing and produce some mock

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:53,219
mock ups and some screens to to test you

00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:58,050
can see some some drawings that have

00:05:53,219 --> 00:06:06,149
been done to test some some solutions a

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:08,729
lot of the screenshots of like some

00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:13,649
possibilities to two of the face Joe

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:16,619
simcha and that was the final result

00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:19,490
that is in production since September

00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:19,490
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:30,199
here's your hand if you have used it on

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:36,749
samachar before a lot of people so I

00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:40,510
will do a little demo so we have a very

00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:45,090
complete guide here you can

00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:45,090
check it to learn more about the simcha

00:06:45,330 --> 00:07:02,590
here we have the filters here I have my

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:07,030
user page I will know the filter that I

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:13,260
have saved before that are the they did

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:19,780
Sunday on the city that I live I you get

00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:22,000
they did to review so here we have the

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:26,200
number of projects that you are create

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,060
modified that deleted the reason why

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:33,520
just change that is considered suspect

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:38,430
and here we have a validation of the

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:42,430
change set so we have for example here

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:47,890
one feature that was flagged that is

00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:53,440
this which was like because like to have

00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:57,940
a highway here that intersects with our

00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:04,720
object that is a building so we can load

00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:10,420
it opposite map herbicide here and we

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:13,840
can edit it so the problem was that that

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:19,240
element was classified as a beauty so I

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:24,480
will remove that tag into each should be

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,480
our news residential

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,800
six the name we had your other problem

00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:47,800
that you can see during the

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:54,320
visualization that no knowledge was like

00:08:47,800 --> 00:09:01,360
drag it so you can see here the sub

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:10,640
transmission line I can find here the

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:15,340
the tower the imaging so I fixed the

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,340
change that we can save it

00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:28,750
and safe so now I can go here and pacify

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:34,780
that change that guy's dead because that

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:42,460
contains euros and I can add the tags as

00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:47,070
well we can put the tag results and I

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,070
can send out a message today to the user

00:09:47,130 --> 00:10:00,820
saying like I found some arrow or or

00:09:52,300 --> 00:10:05,080
should you fix something so I think we

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:09,550
had a little view of what the same child

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,590
dies so it's a torture to you to us

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:15,720
classify this change that as bad as good

00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:22,090
so another personal note lose time with

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:24,460
reviewing that I did we have some

00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:28,210
process to to put the data or a simcha

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,770
we have a change that ingestion we get

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,770
the change that from the replication

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:38,110
files that you are publishing all day in

00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:42,010
the SMAP website we do analyze analysis

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,500
of the change that metadata like looking

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,560
on the on the quench of objects that you

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,630
are creating modifying on the comments

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,500
of the change set or the metadata that

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:56,860
is present on the change that we also

00:10:53,500 --> 00:11:00,310
know lies the user history like the

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:03,700
number of sachets of the user or how

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:08,770
long that the USA has been a GG opposite

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:12,940
map and we finally register that change

00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:18,880
at noon our database we have also the

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:20,950
feature ingestion as you can see here we

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,050
can flag some features inside the change

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:31,060
set it's made basically by another

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:34,870
project name eg SM compare it's a set of

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:38,110
functions that we analyze F

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:42,820
ajit every feature that she is create

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,950
modified or deleted opens it map and if

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,100
we find something like for example in

00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:51,700
that case that I showed the trolls are

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,640
abusing this activist railroad or I

00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:58,690
hadn't had a highway with very sharp and

00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:02,650
go in order phase of speeches that you

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:05,560
think classify as bad so it's like that

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:13,750
features and story into on the database

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:17,860
by by an API request we have done a lot

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:21,850
of improvements on the last Moss we can

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:25,690
filter now by a domestic Eve area we use

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:30,460
non matching to you can like search for

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:34,480
country UI stage CG so its niche which

00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:38,020
makes very useful if you want to filter

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:43,320
item sub areas you can also draw a

00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,320
polygon with your eye area of interest

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:55,650
we can save the filters like if you have

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:58,270
some filters that you are always using

00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:01,410
on the top of the filter page there are

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:05,680
some buttons that you can use to save

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:09,940
and we have lots of the drop-down menu

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:15,100
where you can load your filters we also

00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:17,980
have ICS feed to to the filters that

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,910
you've saved so you can subscribe it on

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:28,330
a feed reader and use it to monitor your

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:30,820
age it's mental digits of the filter we

00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:33,130
can read impose change that comments for

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,830
inside the same char it makes very

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:40,510
easier to trust communicate with the

00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:42,550
mappers you don't need to go to to the

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:48,540
website to post a comment or to read the

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:48,540
comments we have also an API available

00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:56,080
you can check the documentation osm

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:59,360
shadowed my box.com / if the eye dogs

00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:02,150
for example the Rays are just plugging

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,170
that use the essential data each Lodge

00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:09,080
the change that enjoys me that use that

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:12,529
API you can build on other tools using

00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:16,760
their simcha data the API is open for

00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:20,350
everyone we have done some bikini

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:26,600
improvements since the beginning of 2017

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:29,540
we did a Quadra factory on blast wall

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,589
sweep be upgraded to Django dot zero the

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:36,230
back Eng is made with jungle we have

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:39,680
made some enhancements on the database

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,930
models and on the filters to make it

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:48,560
faster to give more more possibilities

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:51,230
of filters we have now for testing a

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:58,910
version with the changes required by the

00:14:51,230 --> 00:15:04,490
gdpr I can pass the the D while at the

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:08,089
end of that version I think in one move

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:11,930
you can publish on production on the a

00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:16,370
new abilities of a simcha with the DGP

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:20,660
are change some plans that we we have

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:23,900
for the future our vision is that resume

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:28,120
checking be a central place for a same

00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:32,270
community to share any review detections

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:36,530
the best map website does not have like

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:40,670
a tool like a function to to to them

00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:48,410
apples like a valley H a chain set so we

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:51,520
we provide that and we can you want more

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:54,910
more more people validating the map so

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:58,040
there are some checking with that place

00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,760
the comments to that you're having a

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,370
massive cha

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,740
give us that the possibility to shared

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:08,580
the our reviews to the website through a

00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:11,280
comment but else the direct site does

00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,860
not have that that that function to

00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:19,350
review the chain sets a simcha is that

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:21,120
to some next features we want to allow

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,140
part of the communities to

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:29,430
post-detection so a simcha what that

00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:32,250
means for example if our interested in

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:37,740
all the changes of buildings in your

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:40,260
city so you we want you you can have

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,210
that the possibility to store all the

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:45,090
changes of buildings in our city inside

00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:50,460
your simcha so you can review all that

00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:53,010
change we want to give like if you are

00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:57,660
interested in in some some part of data

00:16:53,010 --> 00:17:00,780
or some type of data in in some aspect

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,270
of opposite map you can review all the

00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:06,900
change map made all the changes that we

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:10,560
are making that type of data inside of

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,800
simcha we want to make the creation of

00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:17,100
same compact functions easier to read

00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:20,070
the documentation or some compare allow

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:25,590
us to review all the features that are

00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:27,960
modified creative deleted in this map we

00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:32,030
also want to add the rating mechanism

00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:36,900
for better classification of change set

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:43,560
but sample currently we have like dead

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:47,430
dead lips we have here the suspicions

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:51,420
reasons that the reasons why that change

00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:55,260
that is is considered suspect or I think

00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:59,310
it can contain errors but we don't have

00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:03,000
a way to to give priority to some change

00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:06,180
that we want to make easily to the users

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,010
to know what which change sets should

00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,010
they review first

00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:19,680
so giving I squat to each reason or to

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,230
the to the user to the number of

00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:26,070
elements that you are totes doing the

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,840
chain sets we can build a score that can

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,320
classify the change sets and give a

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,380
priority and like save time from the

00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,530
validators to put more effort on the

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,290
change that that could be possibly goes

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:47,580
through the map so it should save time

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:49,710
save a fortune validation and make like

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:55,620
the change that they need more attention

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:58,020
we reviewed first so if you are

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:02,820
interested in making a simcha better

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:06,540
please join us we have all main people

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:11,220
story is the same charge content you can

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:14,750
open issues can contribute to code we

00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,750
have a mailing list as well

00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:23,670
that mailing list you announce the new

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:26,400
releases you can give ideas I'll be in

00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:29,910
the event today so you can talk with me

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,120
if you have new ideas as well we have

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:36,540
Kushan here that is was one of the

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,740
front-end developers and all the map box

00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:43,200
King as well so thank you thank you my

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:48,360
box for supporting that work my symchay

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:56,320
in that dark it very much

00:19:48,360 --> 00:20:04,550
[Applause]

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:06,680
time for some questions first of all

00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:09,380
thank you for a great tool I use it all

00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,150
the time I would like to make a request

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,580
I don't look you touched on it or not

00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:17,170
what picture coming to do but you can

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:20,120
say it's a good edit or a bad at it I

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,650
don't like using bad if somebody forgets

00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,420
to square a building or doesn't know the

00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:28,430
square building best me is not a bad the

00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:30,860
others it's it's not a good at it needs

00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,450
improvement there should be different

00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,110
classifications because I won't tell the

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,330
new user

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,190
it was a bad at it I think that's

00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,890
anything wrong message so I never use

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,800
that unless you they've analyzed the map

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,880
I wish actually doesn't have a job but

00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,040
that's the first thing if you could do

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,210
that I'd be happy to work with you I'd

00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,210
appreciate it

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:54,170
the second thing is and this is this is

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:58,400
kind of stepping further down the movie

00:20:54,170 --> 00:21:00,410
you're thinking of is right now we class

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,530
we're looking at errors that people make

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:05,810
and we we're not taking attainted back

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,270
to what's wrong with the system that may

00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,420
be causing there there it would be it

00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:14,990
would be interesting to start capturing

00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:16,940
some types of classification errors that

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,550
people make so that maybe we can improve

00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:23,150
our editors you eliminate some of those

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:24,980
types of errors but that we take some

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,180
more to be happy to help with you but I

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,610
think that we can start doing some

00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,160
quality tests with it so we serve

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:35,480
improving our editors I think that we

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:42,100
really no block if you want to take that

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:45,770
I'm please do yes nice reactions yes I

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:49,580
think the thing that you use before bed

00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:52,760
was roasted in the bed I think what it

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:56,870
was harmful but it's better good very

00:21:52,760 --> 00:22:00,650
good situation to to change bed for each

00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:03,650
movement yes I was thinking some tools

00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,920
like to Trello versus for example to

00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:09,830
revert a change set from inside your

00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,350
same char or just fix a feature that

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:16,470
just

00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:18,840
but but did the the rest of the change

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:25,280
that is not bad so you could fix it

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,280
faster yes very good suggestions

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:38,200
hello and it's it's quite evident from

00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,760
from the program at this conference that

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,630
there are lots of people working on all

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,539
kinds of machine learning stuff and

00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:49,720
detection of stuff I could imagine that

00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:53,220
because with awesome ciao users can

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,799
actually flag chair as the the other

00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,929
question has to set users can flag

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,850
change such as ok this this is vandalism

00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:03,130
this is bad or something I could imagine

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,799
that some of the people working on all

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:08,500
sorts of automated stuff would be very

00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:10,390
interested to actually harvest that

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,799
information as the learning data set so

00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,690
that they could then say ok here's this

00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,700
change that it was classified as bad or

00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,760
something is that an information that's

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,919
readily available to download from the

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,700
API that you have like which changesets

00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:26,830
have been flagged as what yes to the API

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:31,330
you can get all the information that you

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:33,640
have in your simcha so my box have have

00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:38,020
done some experiments with machine

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:40,870
learning to help detect bad change sites

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:44,230
so you can get your the information you

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:47,460
need through the API and there are there

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:52,409
is an endpoint with or they check edge

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,409
chain sets so it's possible

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,619
