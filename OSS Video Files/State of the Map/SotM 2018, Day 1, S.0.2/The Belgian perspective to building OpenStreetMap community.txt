SotM should be about building community. As a maturing volunteer organisation, OSM Belgium think we can offer some guidance to new organizers and share insights to what OSMF could do to make our lives easier. We focus our talk on how we did as little as possible to become a serious conversation partner for outside organisations and how we deal with turning mappers into a volunteers in a multi-language and divided country. Key insights: find a little money, find a common voice, find shoulders to ride on, show off what you've got.

here we have yours I'm Ben from

00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,949
OpenStreetMap Belgium the Bell the

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,230
Belgian chapter of open suite that will

00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:20,869
give us the Belgian perspective to build

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:23,160
in OpenStreetMap community thank you

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:29,910
yes that's us

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,700
so I'm Ben this is yost and yeah so

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,290
we're going to talk here about building

00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:38,910
community in Belgium and our perspective

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,520
our experiences and our story we thought

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,530
about how we should do this talk and how

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,500
we structure it a little bit because we

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,710
have so many ideas too many ideas to put

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,649
in one talk so we hope to hope to

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,859
concentrate everything here so basically

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,840
the most important part is our mission

00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,090
so why this Oak Street map belgium

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,890
exists that's where everything starts

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,739
from and then the second part is

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,540
strategy and implementation so how are

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,630
we actually trying to accomplish our

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,310
mission so we define our mission and

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,190
this has been our mission for a couple

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,310
of years now to grow and support of

00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:20,670
security in Belgium so this is very

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,780
important because it's it's what we what

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,270
we yeah it's our our baseline or pace

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,640
motivation for doing everything so our

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,500
goal is not to complete the map in

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,180
Belgium or to promote open street map

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,310
but it's to grow and support the

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,780
community in Belgium it's kind of

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,280
different from from those other two so

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,250
now we focus on strategy and

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,580
implementation and we'll give the floor

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,670
to my colleague here Yost I sound so

00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,980
professional that's why we tried to do

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,110
so our primary goal is and that's also

00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,910
what we've started with in the first

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,870
place was to turn mappers into a

00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:02,760
community like so a lot of us were

00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,910
strangers to each other we only knew

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,119
each other's nicknames so first task was

00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:11,730
to turn people into faces or the

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,049
nicknames into faces let's say from

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,510
there you can start building in an

00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:17,610
organization and start doing stuff

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,930
but we don't want to build a massive

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,700
organization we call it a network

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:26,489
organization in the sense that we just

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,409
integrate with whatever exists and don't

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:31,230
try to do too much ourselves that will

00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:33,120
return and then of course big part is

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,549
chroming the mapping community by

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:41,609
turning people who are not yet mapping

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:44,010
into mappers so you already have noticed

00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:47,730
that community comes first so we want to

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,319
be a radically open community which

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,569
doesn't mean the same as being a

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,540
radically open-source we'll get back to

00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:57,569
that it means that we focus on being

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,940
welcoming and we have an open leadership

00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:03,299
and we work on open collaboration we'll

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,310
get back to all those things so in the

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,409
first place extremely welcoming we want

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,150
everyone to join we want everyone to be

00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:13,099
a mapper and we want everyone to be a

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,540
part of the community a very practical

00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,670
implication of that is that you don't

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,109
just value mapping or just value

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,790
developments we try to value anything

00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:25,169
anyone does for the community for

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,079
example you have the mapper of the

00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,720
project which every month shows a mapper

00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:34,709
as a real person and all their aspects

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,690
related to mapping we do have a kind of

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:39,120
a code of conduct I say kind of because

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,340
we decided we'd have one but then never

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,930
actually got around to voting I think

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,739
that's a very good compromise don't

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,639
mention that

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:51,540
yeah that's yeah Belgians are pretty

00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,430
good at making compromises and when it

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,829
comes to people who start mapping and

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,440
make mistakes we don't want to be the

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:07,069
mapping police we see every mistake as a

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:10,199
chance to teach so that means that a

00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:12,840
club like that it's its main focuses we

00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,209
want to be a club you want to join our

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,889
slogan is is not is crazy about mapping

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,380
and that's the one thing we have in

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,750
common is that our community members are

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:27,240
well slightly crazy and especially about

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:29,129
mapping B so yeah some aspects of that

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,419
is to be welcoming

00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:36,119
to invite all people to to join a very

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,029
simple way of growing diversity and that

00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:43,189
way is just not scaring people away we

00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:47,729
don't want a survival of the grumpiest

00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:50,339
we want to we grow diversity by in Korea

00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:54,659
encouraging more than just the default

00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:57,269
skills you would expect and well I don't

00:04:54,659 --> 00:05:00,179
know how good we are at it but it kind

00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:04,679
of by it I think it kind of works I mean

00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:06,899
there's probably yeah Edwards so but

00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:09,029
just probably still a long way to go we

00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:11,909
could go further so I look forward to

00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:14,129
more presentations here about how we can

00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:19,649
go further with that you can you hear

00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:26,490
him okay that better yeah I don't want

00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:29,069
to spit in the yeah right

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,739
so the welcoming part that's the first

00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:34,709
tool probably that we made together is

00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:37,139
tool meant to make it possible and easy

00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,849
to make sure that as much people as

00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,329
possible get a welcome message when they

00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:44,219
first start editing and in Belgium more

00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:46,079
than anything else it's it's a way to

00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,849
invite them to our channels which

00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,289
include our meetup group so that they

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:52,889
would actually get to knows as people

00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:55,669
too a big part of it is also a

00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,769
validation part beginners make mistakes

00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:01,769
so it's it's also helps us to keep track

00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:06,869
of who has been watching or watch I

00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:08,579
validate in new episodes it's by the

00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:11,819
author himself says that it's really

00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:14,189
ugly PHP code but I wouldn't know it

00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:18,839
works and several people use it it's not

00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:20,159
just me who does it which it was in the

00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,860
beginning now there are several people

00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,050
doing it sometimes no one so we try to

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,479
do as much as possible but it doesn't

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,429
always work so we have every every day

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,439
we have new mappers and every day they

00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:33,839
get sent messages and links to our

00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,300
channels in there

00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,809
well we guess what their language is and

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,720
then we send the messages there is no

00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:44,760
statistical impact whatsoever of doing

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,060
when it comes to mapper retention so

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,729
that kind of is pity but it does help in

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,820
getting people to get to connect to our

00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:57,150
channels the eye that we can clearly see

00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,610
now Belgium is also an interesting

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,650
country when it comes to language we're

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,889
like a miniature Europe or maybe

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,540
miniature world so it's not just in the

00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:07,949
North Dutch and then start French you

00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,440
have all these things in the middle and

00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:15,870
more complicated stuff and so we like to

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:17,310
over complicate things politically on

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,610
the political level that doesn't really

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,760
always work that well but like us

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,460
several several other people have solved

00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,520
the problem by ignoring Dutch and French

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,760
and just communicating in English so we

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,889
all of us are equally handicapped when

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,449
we're communicating to each other which

00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:41,669
is good I think of course it does it's

00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,560
not a perfect solution either because

00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,600
for some people it's still really hard

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,240
to switch to English and and we do allow

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,880
and encourage people to speak in their

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,400
own language so all languages are

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,889
welcome on our channel and we think

00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:01,530
maybe that could be something a global

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:05,430
channel could do too yeah this is my

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:07,530
part again so open leadership what do

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:11,039
you mean by that first of all don't do

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,110
everything yourself try to involve other

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,599
people in doing stuff so give other

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,050
people credits like you all set value

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:22,470
their skills equally and and listen to

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:24,810
feedback and communicate yeah listen to

00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,250
feedback from the community and last but

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,139
not least assume you won't be around

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,590
forever because we won't be doing this

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,900
forever so we need people picking up the

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,610
slack afterwards so this is an example

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,339
I'm not sure if you can see it all but

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,900
this has happened yesterday we need to

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,880
change the website you also quickly

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,600
asked is this okay somebody gave

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,600
feedback we adjusted our edits and done

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,130
so it has it could be that simple this

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,040
is an example of a meet-up

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,360
yeah it's again the same picture sorry

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,519
and so people

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,279
sometimes to do meet up so can you do a

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,930
meet-up in our city or can you come to

00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,220
our place and then we say yeah no but

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,130
you can do it yourself

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,540
we have everything we know how to do it

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,820
we have a meetup group we give you

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,130
access we support you maybe we come

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,220
there once just to give moral support

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:18,070
but it's impossible for for us to be

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:22,240
everywhere so we try to enable people to

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:25,480
do their own meetups and map atones also

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,390
very very very good for for us as a team

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,860
to grow because it won't really grow the

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,930
number of mappers you know we thought

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,300
but it could grow your core team because

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,980
you have volunteers helping out they get

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:40,300
involved with the rest of the team and

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:42,130
and so our community grows so open

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,870
collaboration also important we work

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:47,230
together with other open-minded

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:50,399
organizations we build a network around

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:53,200
tourism users so not necessarily mappers

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,300
we recognize contributions and we're not

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,750
afraid to work with companies but yeah

00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:02,320
you shouldn't be naive either about that

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,000
so help companies to help them win that

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,670
means that we help them we give them

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,529
advice about up a street map we give

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,480
them advice about quality in Belgium in

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:13,329
OpenStreetMap we try to help them win

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,790
tenders for public institutions stuff

00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:17,890
like that

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,660
we also help partner organizations to

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,060
implement OpenStreetMap in their own

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,800
organization and we build tools to

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,990
collaborate easier with governments and

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,790
this is something we did here so we

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,070
built a quality checking and correction

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,750
tool for the Brussels government they

00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,390
sponsor the team of students to develop

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:37,690
this and I have also so we have also a

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:41,170
talk about this on Monday at 9 so please

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,420
show up there too what we also do is we

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:47,050
work together with OSU and open Belgium

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,180
so we can organise two conferences a

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:53,339
year by working together with these two

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:57,519
organizations by sharing the workload

00:10:53,339 --> 00:11:00,220
and now it's lost again yeah so we

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,990
return to the being radically open but

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:08,480
not necessarily radically open source so

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:11,990
I was gonna do a quick check

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:16,430
here so does anyone of you use Microsoft

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:21,680
products anyone of you use iOS kind of

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:27,470
systems Facebook maybe Gmail every

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:29,389
software might I ask Google Maps some

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,790
even at the method so we could ask all

00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:33,740
of you to leave but that would be the

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:37,490
most stupid thing ever

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,709
so that's what we tried not to do it

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:43,670
means that we do prefer when we can find

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:45,440
open source solutions but when something

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,250
else works better then we're gonna use

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,290
that for example we when it comes to

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,480
instant messaging with we when there is

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:57,560
a network that uses like well we join em

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,959
on slack but for ourselves we chose it's

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:04,010
also a kind of compromised riot which

00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:07,010
works on matrix it's very very open but

00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,440
it's also kind of user friendly and it

00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:12,560
has an app and stuff like that and even

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,720
our core people who don't like such

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,050
things can still use IRC because it's

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,910
linked but you see like all the I all

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:24,529
the networks that are available we will

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:27,380
use them it's a bit like Richard said

00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:32,089
yeah meet people where they are really

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:36,420
like that talk so yeah we're not about

00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:38,440
software that's been mainly the point

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:43,819
[Music]

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:46,519
yeah so apart from this general overview

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:48,949
there are some like specific things we

00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,630
learned from experience I think the the

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,250
most important thing is do as little as

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:55,880
possible which really fits our

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:58,730
personalities perhaps but it means

00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,010
making place for other people using

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:04,699
resources at your hand and not try to do

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:06,560
everything yourself yeah and then also

00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:08,120
important is that we found out that

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,560
people when they try to get in touch

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,600
with the community they go to the

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,519
mailing list or the forum and then they

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,500
get these reply from five different

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,050
people and they have 10 different

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,750
replies even when there are only five

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,610
people so we will reply at all yeah so

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,649
he we made this

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,899
the point of contact community at was M

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:29,089
will be e we also have a newsletter and

00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:32,149
our website is also oriented to the

00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:34,190
outside so it means our website is for

00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:38,510
people outside of the community not for

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:40,880
the community itself yeah and we also

00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,950
have three so thank you trees if he's

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,529
watching Thank You trees

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,450
this is our guy from open knowledge he

00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:49,610
helps us a lot and he does a lot of the

00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:52,399
legwork we don't have the time to do

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,690
this but he's awesome trees Thank You

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,180
trees

00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,529
so this important they just mentioned

00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,670
been mentioned in a couple of

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:01,010
presentations before

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,940
so talking places people might not have

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:07,040
heard of you before

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:08,480
so that's not here but I mean you should

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,459
talk to people who don't care about

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,769
OpenStreetMap and try to convince them

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:15,500
that it's awesome so that's also

00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:19,100
something we try to do a lot so talk to

00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:22,459
where people are yeah and this is

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,290
important for me personally because this

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:26,930
is something you always get the same

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:29,120
questions and if you do if you've been

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,890
doing this for a while you you get tired

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,649
of the same questions and the same

00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:35,660
answers so if you get tired of that

00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:37,970
stuff and if you sigh if if somebody

00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:41,240
asks you something and you say again the

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,370
same question I would say for yourself

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,760
let somebody else somebody else answer

00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:48,350
those questions because you you can get

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,329
burned out on these kind of things so

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:54,680
please

00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:57,290
yeah and now host three minutes perfect

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,029
so what could a global community do for

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,130
us well I think the most important thing

00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:03,350
apart from this of course yeah we want

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,230
to of course have a voice and the

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,630
OpenStreetMap foundation and that's one

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:12,290
of the main reasons we became we became

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:20,720
a local chapter so now we do have a

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:23,360
voice the second thing is yeah please be

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,360
a club you want to join we would like

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,410
the street man foundation to be a place

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,910
where everyone wants to be and I had I

00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,220
don't know that's not really the case

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,259
right now

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,499
and then when it comes to

00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:42,019
very practical stuff there are some very

00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:44,359
small things that would make our lives

00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:47,689
so much easier some of them have already

00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:50,449
been implemented like having a practical

00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:53,929
community index which is integrated an

00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:55,850
ID and not on chosen you can follow the

00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:58,669
IRS and stuff like that

00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,789
but there are quite a long list of small

00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:03,979
things left to do if you want to talk

00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:07,639
about that on Monday we're doing birds

00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:09,739
of a feather at 12:15 about a community

00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:12,889
building and the kind of tools you might

00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:16,100
see yeah and also this is here because

00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:18,649
we are too small to do this so we where

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,419
we can't do this on our own obviously my

00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:25,669
Belgium or any of the other local

00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:27,410
chapters I guess so yeah and then as to

00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:30,410
close off I think we have to be positive

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,689
all of us OpenStreetMap is still the

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,910
most awesome project ever we have the

00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:36,889
best map in Belgium so we always keep

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,499
saying that every time we go somewhere

00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,359
if F is for people who don't like over

00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,669
street map or don't know it we always

00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:57,319
say we are winning we are the best map

00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:58,269
and join us so yeah that's it thank you

00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:00,289
really

00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:03,139
obviously I feel very strongly about

00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:07,429
everything you've said if anybody talked

00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:09,289
heard me speaking this morning but what

00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:11,179
do you think implementation looks like

00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:13,069
so you have like a list a laundry list

00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:15,559
of things that would be good you told us

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:18,709
to come to the meetup this afternoon or

00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:21,470
on Monday but where would those live as

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,879
ideas like how would we what would be

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,589
the next step so let's say all these

00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:27,799
people in the room said I can do small

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:29,750
medium large of that would it live on

00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,490
the wiki the OSM wiki would it live

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,990
somewhere else would it live like how

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,549
would we implement some of those things

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,740
like I think everyone at somebody has to

00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:37,970
own it but I just since you've done some

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:43,570
really interesting stuff I thought I'd

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,570
ask a hard question warmly

00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:54,060
yeah I I don't know and that's the

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:56,070
problem yes yeah I don't know I don't

00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,820
know I don't know anymore how we can fix

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:11,820
those issues so I guess we can discuss

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:13,530
later right anybody can great work first

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,690
of all do we thank you very much I've

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:21,600
stolen from you guys a lot

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:23,070
preciate it my question is is building

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,070
your community is is really great for

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,390
what is be part local community being

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,890
with OSM

00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:33,600
foundation what does that bring you you

00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,570
can start a community without being part

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,450
of the foundation what does that bring

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:48,630
you I guess we're about to find out

00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:52,650
because I think the very practical use

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:55,650
of it is that it gave us a kind of goal

00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:57,890
to work towards so we needed to have a

00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,880
certain formality we needed to have

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,890
bylaws and we needed to have a

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,530
membership and those those are all

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,600
tedious things to do and when you have

00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:19,860
an end goal or something that you will

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:23,460
get in return that's really useful so

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,950
which kind of channels do you use to to

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:32,340
talk to your community and invite your

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:34,050
community to engage yeah so we as we

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,110
mentioned we try to go where people are

00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:39,060
so we have pretty much any channel but

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,490
it's managed by different people so we

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:45,120
have a Facebook group but that's managed

00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:48,540
by somebody who is on Facebook and we

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,570
have riots as I mentioned which is more

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:54,870
a core group then we have Twitter we use

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,760
that for communication to the outside we

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,080
have the mailing list still but it's

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,930
less traffic

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,580
and it used to yeah we have many

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,580
different channels yeah we have the

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:09,870
forum as well but it's all different

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:12,390
channels different use cases yeah so I

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,420
was just I used the opportunity to ask

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,700
another question about the same thing

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:20,940
how what is the best channel that you

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,890
used to let's say ask your community to

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:26,910
interact with each other so is it the

00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:29,940
Facebook them well no that's more the

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,710
riot channel where the and but you there

00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,530
are different levels in this communities

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,330
things because you we have this we have

00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,800
this core group of people who are really

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,470
active and they are on these channels

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,360
but if you want to involve more people

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:46,350
you have to reach out over the other

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,550
channels so that's different depends on

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,850
the question you want to ask the

00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:54,120
community where you need to go an

00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:58,230
example is that beginners will often ask

00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:01,110
questions on the forum and then there's

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,460
one person very active there and if he

00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,380
isn't out he will come to the right

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,290
group and ask the opinion of more people

00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,270
and then give a summary back to the

00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:14,340
forum so it's kind of an interface

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:17,030
between em yeah my question follows with

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,890
the first questions what are you doing -

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:21,660
yeah and which diversity new groups

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,850
because we are also running for example

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,710
meetup in Berlin and our community is

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,290
quite a verse but for example did the

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,140
speakers and the teachers are still

00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,390
mostly man and it's we have a really

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,310
hard time finding more more women in

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,010
Berlin were dealing with the spirit of

00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:40,380
any practical examples what you did -

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:45,450
yeah get more diversity in your

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:48,480
community so I'm the first to admit that

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:52,700
we need help on that subject we have

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:56,430
your Riga so she is great

00:21:52,700 --> 00:22:00,030
but and then I think our main strategy

00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:02,820
now is that we well the extremely

00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:05,880
welcoming part is our main strategy I'm

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:09,300
not sure that is enough but we hope it

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,430
is but maybe it isn't we don't know but

00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,060
it's not like we deliberately

00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:19,590
had activities to get more people

00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:21,480
involved that that should be a bit yeah

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,880
it means like for example we had this

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,710
this we had this at this certain time we

00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,230
had we had this moment where he had a

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,660
meet up and then a girl showed up and

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:34,050
everybody shout it yeah a girl so that's

00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:36,360
not how you do it and then I explained

00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,520
to everybody like so please next time

00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,110
[Music]

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,560
the fact that she is a girl and showing

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:46,020
up is not the like she she's coming here

00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,960
with the same interests as the rest of

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:53,220
us so that was yeah that actually

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,530
happened I'm just that's something that

00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,110
we organize a lot of map atoms and

00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,750
usually fold one coming to the map atoms

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:03,270
are a lot of yeah elders young people

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:06,240
remain men so you're usually the map

00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,520
atoms bring both diverse people than

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,600
only the meetups

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,700
so we have times yeah yeah and also

00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:19,410
valuing the different skills I think

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,800
also helps but yeah also I'm not sure we

00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,800
need help

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,910
my question is somehow related to the

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:34,650
previous one and yeah is how did you

00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:36,450
build the community I mean yeah you just

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,690
you know recruit two people from the

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:42,270
communication channels or there are some

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,860
specific basins where you try to you

00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,230
know to to find the people I mean

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,530
democracy all answer with an example

00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:52,350
again so we have you Rica and we had a

00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:55,140
meet at mapperton and then this poor guy

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,910
next to her was there and she said we're

00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,890
going to have beers together and you

00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:04,650
have to come and now he's a board member

00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:05,490
so it's it's yeah yeah and also I think

00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,010
meetups

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:10,430
just to meetups that's the thing that

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,510
works best meeting people face-to-face

00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:15,440
is the best thing

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,440
Thanks

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:23,010
we don't have anymore time for questions

00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:28,920
