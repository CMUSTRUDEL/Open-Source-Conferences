SotM should be about building community. As a maturing volunteer organisation, OSM Belgium think we can offer some guidance to new organizers and share insights to what OSMF could do to make our lives easier. We focus our talk on how we did as little as possible to become a serious conversation partner for outside organisations and how we deal with turning mappers into a volunteers in a multi-language and divided country. Key insights: find a little money, find a common voice, find shoulders to ride on, show off what you've got.
