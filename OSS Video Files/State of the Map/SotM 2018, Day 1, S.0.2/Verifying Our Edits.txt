Title: Verifying Our Edits
Publication date: 2018-08-14

Description: 
	Bogdan Petrea and Armin Gheorghina (Telenav), State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/T114-Verifying_Our_Edits/

In this talk, the Telenav Mapping team will present a workflow that lets us regularly check how the OSM community edits our map contributions. The process is based on comparing two OSM PBF files from different times using PostgreSQL queries. The output contains both the the current and previous states of map features edited by us, even if they have been deleted since. This method is a viable alternative for using the big OSM planet history. It does not require a lot of processing power or any big data knowledge. Anyone could use this method to compare a selection of edits to a previous state.

okay hey everyone thanks for joining us

00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:13,990
my name is hope Dan that's my colleague

00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:17,910
Arman so we both work at Tel Aviv as

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:27,099
part of my panelists and that means that

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:33,430
we edit the same data constantly so here

00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:36,520
you can see the u.s. edits in the for

00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:39,520
our team from our team the edits are

00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,550
represented by as on county level and

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:48,309
are based on the most important metro

00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:52,600
areas as Phoenix Dallas or Detroit most

00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:54,879
of already based on road geometry road

00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,000
name chorus fiction and other way

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:03,129
relations most important for navigation

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,330
systems that's a similar example for our

00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:10,600
edits but this time is in Canada the

00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:13,780
edits are presented on census divisions

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:18,130
and also most of them they are focused

00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:25,420
on the main important metro areas in in

00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:28,780
Canada ok so first of all hi why did we

00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:32,140
do this so we as my colleague bÃ¶ck Dan

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,170
said we edit a lot in in osm and every

00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,560
area is different from another so we are

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:41,350
in a constantly learning process and we

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,140
need to improve our edits because we

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:48,880
need to understand the local editing

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:52,479
patterns so we we created this script to

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,820
see the local editing patterns and this

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,490
also helps us to see the evolution in

00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,909
the map or also regression from one

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,920
month to another and we also can see

00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:06,070
which map features are being deleted and

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,979
find out why this this happens so this

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:11,140
is a simple way we developed and the

00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,090
flexible method to better understand the

00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:19,489
local the local editing patterns

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:22,069
the evolution of the map here we can see

00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:25,190
the output of the father of the script

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:26,959
on on the Left we can see some ways some

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,980
service ways that have been deleted and

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:34,340
on the right we can see the OSM data so

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:36,290
in the left there is a previous version

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,180
of the map and on the right it's the

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,160
current version of the map so we compare

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,500
the current version of the map with the

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,810
previous version and find out the

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,630
differences even though these are

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,569
service ways there are pretty important

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:55,790
for a full coverage of the road in in

00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:58,370
osm we also detect modified ways so if

00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,590
the road geometry has been modified here

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,780
we can see a motorway link that has been

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,370
modified has been moved the notes have

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:10,310
been moved up to the north and in the

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,840
left picture we can see the output from

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,200
the script and on the right we can see

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,299
the data as you can observe the other

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,850
parts of the way so the other roads

00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:23,239
besides the modified one are aligned

00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:26,900
with the satellite imagery and also with

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:30,560
you you can also see the OCC tracks

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:36,290
there which which provide us with

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:38,599
accurate positioning of the road ok this

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,660
is all fun and games and this is how the

00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:44,709
script helps us but how does this help

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:47,630
the community so we can identify

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,790
vandalism acts even done by a mistake

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:53,019
because most of them are done by

00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:56,120
mistakes and we can we can see if

00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:58,069
somebody modifies or deletes a big

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,400
portion of the map and we can go to

00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:04,220
those places and edit edit them so it's

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,190
a red flag problem for us and it also

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,349
has our communication with awesome

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,000
community so we can have a better

00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,940
understanding of the local editing

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,120
patterns and also for this project we

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:21,919
work with Liam Neeson and he helps us

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,099
here is an example of some vandalism

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,130
acts in Ecuador it's probably done by

00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:30,980
mistake so in in

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:34,370
area we found a lot of nodes that were

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:38,540
randomly shifted and disappeared in our

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:44,450
script so it was an easy fix and let me

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:48,800
just edit it fast okay so how does the

00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:53,540
tool work first we download to PDF files

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:58,150
or a PDF files is geo fabric we import

00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:01,370
them in as in RGB using osmosis tool and

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:04,580
afterwards we run our or shell script on

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,590
the DB and we have two different outputs

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,900
the deleted map features and the

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,120
modified map pictures and you can see

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:17,540
the map pictures that are currently

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:20,420
supported by our script okay

00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,670
but how's that the tool actually work so

00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:26,420
it's just a shell script that contains

00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:28,340
multiple sequel files and this is a

00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:32,240
visual presentation so this is the

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:36,320
actual script you just input your your

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,360
password you import your or your PDF

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,660
files you import them and afterwards the

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,830
script runs automatically and it exports

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:51,800
the modified and they deleted the map

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:55,100
features this is on Dora so it will be

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,970
short the import will be short you also

00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:02,000
need to input your host to export it

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,370
automatically and it creates a new

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:12,710
folder for you name output where you can

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:15,550
find your files ok so we had some

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:19,280
problem with with this because osmosis

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:22,820
doesn't really know how to import into

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,560
into two different schemas we started

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,280
him important in two different schemas

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,730
because we use Postgres Postgres sequel

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,440
and we cannot cry across query between

00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,850
databases to see the differences between

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,729
them so what we did was to create two

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,460
schemas so we use those verses to import

00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:43,440
it into

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,509
the public schema so import a PDF into

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,780
the public schema and afterwards we

00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:52,319
created a new schema and migrated all of

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:55,440
those tables and so the public was used

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,680
as a temporary temporary place and we

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:03,560
imported the new PDF there so it is easy

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,560
to cross query the table in this way

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:13,470
okay so after we have to PBS imported we

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:18,000
need to start generating the output the

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:20,580
output files or what we need so in order

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,120
to do this way as my colleague said you

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:27,330
use multiple SQL queries that compares

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,120
the nodes the ways and relations but

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:34,229
also compares the text from those map

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:38,580
features buying the copying are made by

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:43,380
between the same PBS file loaded before

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:49,759
and this is how the output is it's

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:53,039
January so in order to obtain the output

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,840
we did some cross queries that involves

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,229
creating buffers calculating the

00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,900
distance between move nodes and

00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:04,099
calculation moving angles between nodes

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:08,460
and checking if the deleted road

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:14,130
geometry was added nearby so and for

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:17,159
better accuracy consistency we filter

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:20,060
the results based on specific threshold

00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:23,610
and specific conditions because

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,460
initially we obtained a lot of ways a

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,909
lot of very big output and we need to

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:34,770
filter the data in order to become way

00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:38,250
more relevant and useful for us so we

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,589
also when we apply the threshold we we

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:44,490
took in consideration the road category

00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:47,220
also because we focused on especially on

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:50,010
the navigable roads because those are

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:54,209
the most important for a navigation

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,630
system so we took situation or a service

00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:00,390
where

00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:06,660
ten shells and so on motorway okay so

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:09,540
after we output we split it in two major

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,750
categories deleted my pictures and

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:17,520
modified my feature and each of this

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:21,740
each of this category has subcategories

00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:29,150
based on the on the map feature type as

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:32,720
ways names relations and so on pouring

00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:36,590
for example in case of the deleted

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:41,160
restriction we also compare if the

00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:43,860
restriction ID is in both of the PPF

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:48,110
version and it is not we also compare

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:52,950
the members and geometry members because

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:56,160
the users deleted restriction and add it

00:09:52,950 --> 00:10:00,390
with a new relation ID and doesn't mean

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:04,920
that that decision is is deleted so we

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:07,340
compared also the geometry of each

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,340
member

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:15,030
okay after after we generate the tables

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:19,080
in our database with output we we need

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:23,450
to export the files so we exporting the

00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:28,290
in two formats shapefile and Joe Jason

00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:32,550
we choose this because Joe Jason is a

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:36,420
simple way to load it into your editor

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:44,400
and this way more flexible and it's very

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:47,820
easy to review also the export is made

00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,490
on the same directory you previously

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,820
copied to PDF files so it's very easy to

00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:56,880
find its export it automatically and for

00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,010
there you just take the paths from there

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,920
and loaded in your editor and start

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:08,160
reviewing the files or editing it is the

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:14,010
case okay the the code is on our felon

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:16,920
github page the discrete and readme

00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,350
files are there read me file contain all

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,600
the files you need and all the

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:26,750
requirements or dependencies

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:32,330
they are needed to run the descriptor so

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:32,330
you can take a look and see what's there

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,710
okay so now that you know how we

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:44,190
generate the data let's let's create

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:46,260
some cool Maps this is the data from the

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,260
deleted road geometry for the San

00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,420
Francisco Bay Area and it presents the

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:56,060
differences from two months from June

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:59,040
2018 to July 2018 so the higher the

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,500
column is the the bigger the bigger the

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,540
density of the deleted ways are so you

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,070
can see in the Oakland area that there

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:11,520
are a lot of deleted deleted roads we

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:14,730
applied the same thing on a US level

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:18,090
mostly on the top 60 metro areas as you

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:21,150
can see the East Coast has the most

00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:25,020
delicious delicious delicious it's the

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:32,670
most of the removed ways in in this

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:36,960
relative short period of time so here

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:40,140
are the modify the nodes if if you can

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,240
see there is a there is a graph down

00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:45,300
where you can see the initial position

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,380
of the node and modify location this is

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,150
probably again to some mistakenly

00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:56,010
vandalism or somebody just pulled the

00:12:51,150 --> 00:13:00,780
node by by mistake we also did this on a

00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:03,480
US level but here you can see a modified

00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,210
intersection for us this is a red flag

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,430
because we know that in this

00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,720
intersection there were a lot of

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,820
modified nodes so this means that

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,400
probably there is there is a road in

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:18,089
construction there or there is something

00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:22,160
going on with the geometry so it it

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,160
really helps us if we check it out

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:32,209
this is on the US level so the modified

00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:32,209
notes on the US level

00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:49,379
it's the same intersection and as

00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:52,829
previously before for this presentation

00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:56,369
we're under the tool for entire us and

00:13:52,829 --> 00:14:00,779
we extract it from there a few metrics

00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:03,899
and a few examples or to show you and

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:07,169
for for deleted road names we noticed

00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:11,629
that a lot of residential and

00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:11,629
unclassified road names are deleted

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:22,079
they're dissipating on the entire entire

00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:25,470
us so even the dirts low-level high

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:29,789
categories road is important too to add

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:33,089
back the road the road name the same

00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:37,859
pattern we noticed also deleted the road

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:42,119
geometry we're on period of time of one

00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:47,189
month there was deleted about 400 miles

00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:50,879
of road geometry especially in service

00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:53,309
and residential residential ways so we

00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,379
noticed that a lot of parking lots and

00:14:53,309 --> 00:15:02,730
service we are deleted for no reason

00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:08,720
don't know why and on the restriction we

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:14,179
notice that a lot of users added the

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:17,069
road geometry by changing the highway

00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:20,279
geometry from single way to dual

00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:22,589
carriageway and so on when when they

00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:25,230
edit the road they forgot to add back

00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:28,649
the restriction if only it's a must to

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:32,069
add it back so we noticed that a lot of

00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:35,819
no u-turns are deleted from from the map

00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:37,499
because user forgot to add back the

00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:42,989
rescission after they finish with

00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:48,559
updating the road the road geometry okay

00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:52,170
so in the new feature we will implement

00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:55,170
more supported map features

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:58,079
I don't know lane number or speed limit

00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:02,700
or picture that helps us to do the

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:05,339
navigation and also we want to upload

00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,430
results the output directly into a web

00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:13,829
server in in order to be more visible

00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:19,050
for a community and skip the step when

00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:21,930
you load it to the output into jaws so

00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:26,300
made it or something like that so you

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:29,670
want to improvise it you improve that

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:34,320
okay here's the github link for our

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:37,139
TeleNav mapping mapping team feel free

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,540
to check it and if you have any ideas

00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:43,380
for improvement or updating please

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:49,079
contact us on the listed mail address

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:53,760
and we'll be happy to discuss and this

00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:58,070
tool that would be all so thank you for

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,070
your attention and have any questions

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,010
[Music]

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:08,610
thanks for your presentation I have just

00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:12,419
one short question when you are

00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:14,610
comparing the data before yesterday and

00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:17,040
today or few months ago

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:23,100
you're basically comparing osm drop

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:26,400
right and concluding depths that file or

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:30,900
some drop you will have exactly what

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,750
user made what changes and what is

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:37,710
deletion and that will gonna trigger

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:41,460
your flight just that that that is my

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:44,280
question so we have all the user

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:48,809
information we compare from one month to

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:51,990
another and but we we only filter for

00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:55,410
the TeleNav users so we do not have a

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:58,530
column with the users ID we just fix the

00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:01,500
problems but if we see that an user ID

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,540
repeats and it signals that there is a

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,519
vandalism in the map will contact the

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,279
user in

00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:10,629
sym what's what's happening if a mass

00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:15,830
deletes something regularly or something

00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:18,289
so one question that I have is so by the

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,809
fantastic presentation like clearly a

00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:24,080
lot of great work so wondering how much

00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:26,269
of this is like open source or like

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,799
available thought let's say if we want

00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:30,649
to adapt this to our own local

00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:33,409
communities and the local data sets like

00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:35,570
like we like how much of this is easily

00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:40,519
accessible in like small visualization

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:43,070
look like on tech dot GL like are some

00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:47,029
of those accessible for us to use just

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:51,159
wondering the whole the whole code is on

00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:55,579
github we use only open source tools and

00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:58,519
we made a few queries but basically most

00:18:55,579 --> 00:19:00,799
of them is open source so we don't mind

00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,109
if you want to change it or updating or

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,820
improve one

00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:10,219
you can ask I step outside of my role of

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,019
just bring you the microphone in the key

00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:16,969
table repository you are missing the

00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:20,209
license file so if I I find one of those

00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:22,459
guys which are really aware of open

00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:24,799
source licenses I say okay there's no

00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:26,959
license there so if you can pick step it

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,029
would be awesome so you can use the code

00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:31,039
if you want for personal use but if you

00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:32,479
want to use it for I don't know company

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,700
use or for something like that we have

00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,950
to talk to the company and and to see

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,629
what what the licensing should be like

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,639
but if you want to use it for yourself

00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:42,589
it's on github you can use it but

00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:44,539
afterwards I first have to talk to my

00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:48,820
legal team and after afterwards I can

00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:56,719
tell you an answer okay if you put that

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:58,519
clearly on the repo it's great thanks

00:19:56,719 --> 00:20:01,669
for the presentation how do you engage

00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:04,070
with users whose changesets you're

00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:07,609
reverting and how do you do you have a

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:09,979
strategy for avoiding edit wars where

00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:11,450
they a user who might not see your

00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:13,729
message if you're trying to engage them

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:17,539
would just delete the road again or

00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:18,320
because they think parking lanes don't

00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:22,370
belong and opens

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,380
map or something so since we started

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:28,009
this process we haven't reverted like

00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:30,740
any any Chinese said mostly we this

00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:33,590
process is for for us to adapt our

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:36,590
editing patterns to locals so basically

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:39,200
we just learn from the locals but if we

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,000
see something that is it might be wrong

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,950
if a users does some time some things

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,960
like mass deletion or something will

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,240
contact him and say look you you did

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,220
wrong here is there a problem can can

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,980
you tell us is there the road design

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,620
construction so we don't revert anything

00:20:51,980 --> 00:21:04,220
firstly we we contact the users and talk

00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:07,840
to them okay if there are no other

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:12,640
questions we can thank our speakers

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,640
