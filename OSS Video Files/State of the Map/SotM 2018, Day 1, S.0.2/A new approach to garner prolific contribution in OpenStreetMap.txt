OpenStreetMap (OSM)’s model of crowdsourcing data from volunteers is its greatest strength, and biggest challenge as this leads to gaps in OSM data, especially in developing regions. Predominant methods of engagement eg. mapping parties exhibit limited success in sustaining participation, which curbs the fulfillment of data gap. To engage youth from under-mapped regions in enriching local OSM data, while also developing their skills for the digital age as an alternative model to participate in OSM community, we designed the Digital Internship and Leadership (DIAL) program.

We will present our experiences with designing and conducting two cohorts of DIAL (for 8+22 youths) as a remote internship program, along with our assessment of DIAL’s impact in filling data gap and challenges observed. We found that DIAL helps 1) in mapping those areas significantly faster, 2) sustaining motivation of interns during the program, and 3) developing their civic awareness and digital leadership skills. Results from DIAL can be helpful in designing programs for engagement in OSM and similar communities.

nabela is one of the most vulnerable

00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:13,340
countries in terms of disaster risk

00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:16,760
Nepal ranks 33 out of 194 countries in

00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,339
the index for risk management rankings

00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,710
and the image that you see on the screen

00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:26,359
is an image of all the recorded

00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:29,179
earthquakes of different magnitudes so

00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:32,180
as you can see in the image the risk for

00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:33,950
earthquakes are spread almost evenly

00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:39,559
throughout the whole countries in and

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:41,660
around the country but even though the

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:44,030
risk is spread very evenly the

00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,940
availability of map data that helps us

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,399
to deal with the crisis is not spread so

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,899
you evenly the data divide which is a

00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:56,920
combination of the digital device which

00:00:52,899 --> 00:01:00,350
itself is probably because of the

00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,960
economic divide it's not very favorable

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:06,860
to places like tally code which is a

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,630
remote district in Nepal but as you can

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,260
see for the big cities like Kathmandu

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,010
the availability of map data even in in

00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:19,910
OpenStreetMap is very good so how do you

00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:23,750
address the availability of map data in

00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:26,300
places like calico where the current

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,630
approaches to map mapping in

00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:32,150
OpenStreetMap have not been very very

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,890
good so this is the question we ask

00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,140
ourselves how do you remain prepared

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:42,230
with maps against disasters that could

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:44,030
strike any day and anywhere good

00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,040
afternoon my name is cities canal I am a

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,050
researcher at Kathmandu living labs and

00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,090
I talk about our new approach we tried

00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,820
to garner prolific contributions in

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,820
OpenStreetMap we designed a digital

00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,800
internship and leadership program at

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,890
Curtin living labs and this presentation

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,160
is our own assessment of the whole

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,840
experience how it went

00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,469
let's start with existing approaches in

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,269
OpenStreetMap community as we are all

00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:15,709
the vibrant members of the community we

00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:18,170
know about making

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,719
individual contributions crisis mappers

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,879
these are more popular ones and recently

00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:26,359
we have seen various companies like

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,879
Facebook map box Apple using employing

00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:30,859
people to contribute data and also

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:35,930
maintain the data quality as a part of

00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:40,819
your work so we have some experiences

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,349
from the OSM community of Nepal that

00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:45,109
shows that the remote and underdeveloped

00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:49,370
places like China Cote are barely mapped

00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:51,470
and this low retention of people in our

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,349
after mapping parties our crisis

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,500
marathon's its mapping parties are very

00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:59,389
good for for the social interaction in

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,650
the community meeting people face to

00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:06,709
face but it's also but very few people

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,169
who come to mapping parties and mostly

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:13,549
the new people do not continue mapping

00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:15,560
after the mapping parties and also the

00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:17,780
common demographic of mappers we see in

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,169
Nepal are the university educated males

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,979
who are living in major cities of Nepal

00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:27,680
I think this is a case for many places

00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:32,599
as the most scholarly research also

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,720
corroborate this finding this indicates

00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:38,840
two things so first is that we know who

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,060
to approach if we want to make maps but

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,239
this also indicates the problems problem

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,750
that there is a need for a greater

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,359
gender inclusion in the community and

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,430
OpenStreetMap is considered one of the

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,799
special cases of new geography where a

00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,290
common criticism is that it doesn't

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,979
actually empower the people who are on

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:03,669
the ground contributing or volunteering

00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:08,720
geographic information so we also try to

00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:12,739
try our best to empower the mappers so

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,689
in a in order to address different

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:19,220
issues that we have experienced in the

00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:20,930
community we decided that we need to try

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,219
something else in order to supplement

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:29,180
the existing approaches so we came up

00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:32,449
with an intervention so sorry for the

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,040
bad pun so it's a program that is

00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:37,490
targeted to students and recent

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,680
graduates from any academic domain from

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,710
Nepal basically we are trying to utilize

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,720
their leisure time to map remote places

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,430
of Nepal it's an unpaid internship

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,100
program run by craftsmen believing labs

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,010
and most of the tasks that they perform

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,800
in their internship is the remote

00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:58,449
mapping tasks because they can do it

00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:04,220
from the comfort of your own home to map

00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:06,830
different places but we decided that not

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,990
only can they map but we can also help

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,479
them learn about maps learn about

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,400
geography society read different things

00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,280
practice critical thinking writing and

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,870
presentation skills all as a package of

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,580
the program and the interns during the

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,340
internship period do not have to come to

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:29,720
our office they can use your own space

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:31,910
own home to do their tasks and the

00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,650
interaction with carrier staff and among

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:39,020
themselves is mostly virtual so if I had

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,570
to summarize what we wanted to do in a

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,190
single line that's this is what we

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,770
wanted to do utilize young people's

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:49,160
needs the time for a predefined period

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:51,830
through an intensive period to map on

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,280
the map places so there are several

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:58,550
stages in conducting the intensive

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,940
program in which we called as dialed in

00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:05,210
sort so first the recruitment we open

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:08,510
online applications for every students

00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,400
young people and then they we conduct

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,130
telephone interviews and based on the

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,639
telephone interviews and their online

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,770
application we select we select the

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,810
interns and they are trained for four

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,810
days in which we teach them remote

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,970
mapping skills field mapping skills

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,970
visualizing data on the wave and there

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:32,570
are also nature's about many related

00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:34,910
things such as such as geography crisis

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:38,210
management civic awareness things that

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,340
could really help them and then and then

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,890
the internship program actually

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,570
so the internship failure so far we have

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,730
conducted two different parts of

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,850
internship the first cohort was two

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,430
months long it was for ten students and

00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:56,720
the second part was three months along

00:06:52,430 --> 00:07:00,440
and it was for 22 students but only 19

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:05,060
continue the program so these are the

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,070
students of the first cohort most of

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,860
many of the students had a background in

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,450
geomatics engineering few of them in

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,970
crisis management one had in

00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,850
architecture and then we had students

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:19,280
coming from forestry and business

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:22,970
administration at as well so it was kind

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,860
of a mixed cohort in a period of two

00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,770
months the eight interns who continue

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:31,730
the program we're mostly involved in

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:33,950
four victors including mapping product

00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,900
areas in the southern plains of Nepal

00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,750
and mapping places in mountainous

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,720
regions so in a period after two months

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:45,230
they maps 183 thousand buildings and the

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:49,280
1400 Road but these numbers don't tell

00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:51,620
the full story as you all know similarly

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,460
in 2018 we land the second cohort of

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:59,810
dial for a bigger group we had we

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,190
trained 20 to 22 students and 19 of them

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,700
continue of the program after the

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:07,940
training and we also had students with a

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,850
background in computer science

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,990
geomatics engineering and then we also

00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:18,890
had a few from veterinary science and

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:21,740
public health this is also mixed cohort

00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:25,070
as well and in the period of three

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,860
months the 19 interns mapped for tasks

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,960
that involve mapping districts in

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,290
mountainous hilly and plane regions of

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,360
Nepal and they mapped 206 thousand

00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:42,470
buildings and 4 thousand kilometers of

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:45,920
road so the places that look like this

00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:49,220
before so I took the data in January

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,770
first at the end very for 2018

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:55,290
this place is near one of the very

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,020
one of the big cities of Nepal in Nepal

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,089
once it's in the South southern part of

00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,410
Nepal so even though the place is close

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:06,180
to a big city it does not map very well

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,380
so after the internship program the data

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,610
is more dense and there are more details

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,649
but you can see there are so many

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,010
buildings and roads and the water

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:19,170
needles are mapped but not much name so

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:27,209
that that is one of the problems of the

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:29,640
remote internship program that is why we

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:33,510
were working very closely with Nepali on

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,899
some metropolitan city office in our one

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,580
of our since technology projects and and

00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,100
the city office was concerned with the

00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,950
lack of geospatial information

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:46,740
infrastructure around the uniforms of

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:49,500
metropolitan cities so we designed a

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,500
custom version of dial for Nepal ones

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,140
some metropolitan city in which we

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:58,560
recruited 10 local youths from from the

00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:01,829
money from the students in the same area

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,810
and then we are trained them in remote

00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:05,579
mapping skills field mapping skills and

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,890
the skills similar to other cohorts of

00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:12,750
dial but there are few differences in

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,570
dial departments from the other two dial

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,880
pods one was that it's done is called

00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:21,000
coordination with the municipality

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,540
office it was a paid internship program

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,730
and the tasks were more heavy on film

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,370
mapping because the musi by we had

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,640
certain interest like they wanted to map

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,709
all the industrial areas nearby so this

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,730
was more heavy on film mapping compared

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:42,240
to the heavier on remote mapping for the

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:46,589
previous cohorts and in a period of two

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,390
months the 15 interns performed both

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,149
remote mapping and field mapping tasks

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:56,520
and they map a thousand buildings and 80

00:10:51,149 --> 00:11:00,570
kilometres of roads so after running

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,790
three different courts we decided to dig

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,580
a little deeper than just number of

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:09,150
buildings they had created a number of a

00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,710
it's innovation that they had made so we

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,720
realized that the students we had a

00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,790
background in geomatics engineering they

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,160
were mapping more than other students so

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,260
we asked the questions do interns with a

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,150
background in geography map more since

00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:28,110
they have more understanding of the

00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:30,780
value of map data we created a graph for

00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,780
before the internship during infancy and

00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:37,440
after intensive of the number of daily

00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:40,950
nodes created by the group of two

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,490
students and we found that although the

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,710
engineers

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,020
although the geomatics engineers all

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:48,240
hadn't map was before the internship

00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:51,360
during the Indians if they mapped a bit

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,190
more than other interns but after the

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,290
interns after the internship program

00:11:53,190 --> 00:12:00,600
they they continued mapping while the

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,840
lime stayed flat for rest of the interns

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,330
so but I have to consider that this

00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,580
study was done only for the first cohort

00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,470
so that's only eight students and the

00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,530
evidences that we find here are more

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,240
suggestive than conclusive we plan to do

00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:18,120
similar analysis for the second cohort

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,210
and and the poets that we run in the

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,320
future but these are some findings from

00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:27,660
our Audley analysis and similarly since

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,560
we are proposing a supplementary

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,110
alternative approach approach to mapping

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,870
remote corners we decided to compare it

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:39,030
with the existing crowd-sourced approach

00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:42,350
of projects like the humanitarian

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:45,390
OpenStreetMap team so we collected data

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:48,200
all the crowd sourced mapping projects

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,280
with beginner and intermediate

00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,760
difficulty level that were completely

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,580
mapped and then we can compare it with

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:59,640
the tasks that will done by students of

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:02,790
dial cohort 2 we we did not included the

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,680
students of dial covered one because the

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,600
tasks were mixed and the tasks that they

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,850
were performing were also done by other

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,720
people from the community so we do not

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:14,879
include data from the first part but

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,879
doing in the second board we found that

00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,009
the red dots are for dilating projects

00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,839
and the blue dots for routers 19

00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,850
projects and most of the crowdsource

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,649
mapping projects are small in area and

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:30,059
they are completed within a period of

00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:33,739
two days but many tasks are also bigger

00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:38,759
in the area and they are also completed

00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:42,209
in more than 50 days but in the very

00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:45,779
small sample size that we have we found

00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:47,789
that two of our tasks were small and

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:50,489
they were also completed within few days

00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:53,459
but there were two tasks which were

00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:55,589
considerably larger than most tasks and

00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,989
what they were also completed in the

00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:00,359
number of days that is less than the

00:13:57,989 --> 00:14:05,160
median values of the crowdsource

00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:06,929
approach and again this study is also

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,970
very simplistic and it's replete with

00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,069
assumptions so we don't want to say

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,279
anything that the results are conclusive

00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:16,729
but they also suggest that if you have

00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:20,999
if you have some interns who have

00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:22,649
specific tasks to map in their in their

00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:25,799
leisure time then the task gets

00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:30,059
completed faster than the existing

00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:32,939
approaches so we also wanted to know

00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:35,039
what is it that motivated students to

00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:36,809
participate in a program like dial so we

00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,659
made a list of all the possible

00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:42,720
motivations and then we asked we asked

00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:45,239
them to rank the motivations in a like

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,629
of skin in a Likert scale and we found

00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:52,739
that the thing that attracted the

00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:55,079
students most to the to the internship

00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:57,479
program are in the order as listed below

00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:59,850
so they were most interested in learning

00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,709
digital leadership skills they I know

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,649
it's a very big term and people could

00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:07,079
define it as they please but and

00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:09,059
followed by contributing to society

00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,829
learning to map getting a fast

00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:12,499
professional job experience making

00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:14,909
productive use of their free time

00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:20,220
understanding geography and society

00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:22,769
through mapping so assessing how much

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,449
people map and the number of nodes they

00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:27,290
create is easy but how do I say

00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:29,700
something like civic governance although

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,070
raising the civil civic awareness is

00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:36,360
also a goal of the program so we have

00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:38,460
few pointers from the blog post that our

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,900
interns have written and report them

00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,790
submitted and a student duck Sita she

00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:49,890
had a background in architecture and see

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:51,330
notice that you see she told us that see

00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,960
we're noticing places you would have

00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:57,840
probably ignored because of because of

00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:03,210
napping it made our more aware of our

00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:06,780
surroundings and another interment miss

00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:11,090
I was is that secrets solve the society

00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:14,760
by managing our leisure time properly

00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:16,620
similarly a student most of our students

00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,620
live and study in the big cities of

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,900
Nepal so they do not have much idea

00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,080
about what goes on in the remote corners

00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,270
of Nepal so so strawberry was pleased

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,670
that you got to know the socio-economic

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,520
condition of people from different parts

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:36,750
of Nepal through the process of remote

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:41,150
mapping and then we have another big

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:45,320
term the leadership so how do you see if

00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:50,030
if the internship program has helped

00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:52,650
them to advance their leadership skills

00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,690
there was a feature article in one of

00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:59,100
the most popular online news portals of

00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:01,170
Nepal about digital mapping and two of

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,910
our interns from each squad were

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:09,680
interviewed for the article and they

00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,680
were also featured in the article

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,900
similarly some of our interns have gone

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,880
on to represent and present their

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,420
experiences in the international forums

00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,340
like state of the map Asia and ASEAN

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:29,930
ministerial conference on disaster risk

00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:29,930
reduction so

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:41,450
to be very honest we had an idea we

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:44,000
tried it and and we had some

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,580
expectations and most of the

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,960
expectations were filled but we have you

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,750
that reflections from the whole

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,790
experience so there are there were

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,760
certain challenges and some limitations

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:58,550
for example the program like entire

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,860
cohorts fosston to put only addressed in

00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:03,470
word mapping so so if we really want

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,300
more detailed mapping more mapping that

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:09,410
is of interested interest to local

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:11,990
people it means custom programs like the

00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,820
Diana pal girls and similarly partial

00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,880
communication is no substitute for

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,130
interactions in person so we cannot just

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,380
leave them to perform their tasks a at

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,330
home because it might affect their

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,890
motivations to continue the program so

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,690
we need the right balance of in-person

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,060
meetings and partial communication

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,550
similarly we also need to provide

00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:37,360
regular support to interns through

00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:41,330
dedicated staff through dedicated staff

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,090
so to conclude I would like to say those

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,160
three things that the dial approach can

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,430
supplement existing approaches in

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,740
mapping in the OSM community as we have

00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:53,570
experienced similarly it can help engage

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,060
youth in feeling critical data gaps in

00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,100
places that around the wrong side of the

00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,510
digital divide and the process of

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,850
mapping and learning or practicing

00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,740
digital skills make them more aware of

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:16,640
their surroundings and help them prepare

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:18,440
for leadership thank you hello cities

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,780
yes very nice presentation just one

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,670
quick question about the internship so

00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,470
one of the challenges that we have as

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:27,710
well is to have internship is looking at

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:30,650
companies or like organizations that use

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:33,470
OpenStreetMap but in your case is it

00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,330
only at the kathmandu living labs or or

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:38,870
the internship is at other organization

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,520
that may also use OpenStreetMap i mean

00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:44,630
how do you find the place for the

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:47,600
internship yeah so far you suddenly

00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,460
by carpenter living labs but if other

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,570
organizations are interested to run a

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,820
similar program then we might be able

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:58,120
then we will certainly help as much as

00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,120
we can

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,430
