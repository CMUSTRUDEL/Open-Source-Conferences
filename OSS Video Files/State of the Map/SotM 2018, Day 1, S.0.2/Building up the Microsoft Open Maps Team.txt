Microsoft has slowly been building up it's capabilities for contributing to OpenStreetMap through it's Open Maps team. The idea for the Open Maps team is to work alongside other paid mapping teams and the larger OSM community to help close gaps in data for areas important to Microsoft. Curating content and contributing to a database that Microsoft does not own outright is a new concept. Our team has been able to ride wave of an increasingly Open Source friendly environment at Microsoft to make this happen.

In this talk Microsoft will describe some of the challenges for setting up a new mapping team within the much larger organization and the balancing act of working with the community while being mindful of Microsoft priorities. The team will show it's focused on quality through formalized training, editor metrics and the development of internal workflows that emphasize quality over quantity and how that ultimately scales.

good afternoon everyone thanks a million

00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:11,040
for for coming by and as I said my name

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,019
is Joe Sheen I've been working with the

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,540
open maps team over at Microsoft trying

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,110
to improve the base map for open street

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,619
maps and so well we'll talk about today

00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,750
is just sort of open source mapping in

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,149
general with the editorial team some of

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,290
the projects that we've been working on

00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:30,450
some of the tools we've used the

00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,919
processes we've put in place and then

00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:36,539
sort of some of the results we've seen

00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:38,309
up until now so yeah I suppose first and

00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,190
foremost I can just tell you all that we

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,530
only started this team in November 2017

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,870
so we started basically with just an

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,170
idea of what to do but not much more of

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,670
a better idea beyond that and so

00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,370
starting off that editorial team we had

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,179
we had just myself and since then since

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,649
November we've built it up to 18 editors

00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:01,350
12 over in Seattle and then the other

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,030
six over in Belgrade in in Serbia and so

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,860
with that in some of the development

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,980
team that work over in Serbia and in

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,810
Seattle and we've been working on the

00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:15,000
base Road map of Australia and trying to

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,650
improve that so yeah so just very

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,180
quickly just about the open source of

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,190
Microsoft and how we've been able to

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,920
sort of work on this about a year ago

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:26,430
Microsoft were recognized as one of the

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,650
largest source contributors to give help

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,870
and since then that trained that that

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,310
trend has just continued upwards and as

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,820
you can see the numbers there in terms

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:39,000
of the repos contributors and teams did

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,620
not exist there and so having Microsoft

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,240
having that sort of presence in the open

00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,670
map or sorry the open source community

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,320
has made it very easy for us to sort of

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,420
get this thing off the ground and start

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,650
running in the way that maybe there

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,950
would have been other roadblocks in the

00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,740
way so in terms of the open source

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,330
mapping one of the things we looked at

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,830
it at the beginning was from the outset

00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,530
we were gonna have to be very very much

00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,090
in line with the community as well as

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,230
sort of like look at several different

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,780
things from a research perspective

00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,789
before we even started making any edits

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,069
in it so one of the things was just

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,780
looking at what the OS and guidelines

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,060
were in terms of their tagging and the

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,760
mapping policies there but also what was

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,840
important and what

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,250
what was essential to how did the

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,380
guidelines were implemented from the

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,380
Australian perspective so with those two

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,380
in with those two sort of looked up to

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,120
we were trying to figure out okay if if

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,920
we're going to go under the priorities

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,320
of improving the base roadmap for

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,880
Microsoft well then you know we want to

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,670
sort of strike at kind of balance in

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,170
terms of like how they like how they

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,360
implement the OS and guidelines in

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,520
Australia but also sort of be respectful

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,250
of the way that they did it in in

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,220
relation to what edits we were making to

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,810
the roadmap itself so the next thing we

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,100
were looking at was well okay the Beck's

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,930
part of the research was what data is

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,340
available and so we said is that is it

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,480
what's available on a local city

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,130
regional or national level and so what

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,110
we we noticed though pretty quickly was

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,270
that all of the eight territories within

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,580
Australia they each had their own Road

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,290
Authority network there were Road

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,820
authorities that were tasked with

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,459
maintaining the data for their own

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,050
network and so very quickly we saw on

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,120
the ID set the tree of the territories

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,130
did not really have much of an open data

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,989
policy and so this was going to be some

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,640
sort of issue that came across when we

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:25,980
were trying to look at what the coverage

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,430
and consistency and accuracy was and how

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,690
we were going to tackle that but that

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,400
made all sort of sense from one

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,900
perspective but the most important

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,030
aspect to the whole thing and it to be

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,670
successful was just engaged with the

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,280
local Open Street Map community in there

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,019
and so what we did when we were ready to

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,640
start sort of like okay let's get

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,560
involved with this stuff was like we

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,780
started coming out and what we did in

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,760
December was that we announced everyone

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,830
on the Torquay you list this is who we

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,840
are this is what we intend to do there

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,400
these are the sources that were going to

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,989
use and these are all the people who are

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,120
involved and so we put all of this out

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,440
on github and so anyone who was

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,570
interested could come and have a look

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,310
and so that was met very positively

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,660
initially obviously people are quite

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,430
passionate about their maths and so

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,769
they're like who are all these heads

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,390
over in Serbia and the US working on our

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,680
map right but then once they looked at

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,570
what it was they could see that okay

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,950
we're not really affecting some of the

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,239
things that are like administrative

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,400
borders or anything like that to really

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,260
just look enough you know what the open

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,940
sources are available and then kind of

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,440
confirming out with aerial imagery and

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,599
what the pillory imagery was there and

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,660
these sort of things GPS traces in that

00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:30,510
so

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,410
looking into like how they all

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,910
communicated with each other obviously

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,830
every country and each sort of

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,360
OpenStreetMap community is all going to

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,650
be chatting in a different level and we

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,750
saw that the talk lists were

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,730
tremendously active and so that was why

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,650
we came out there but we also got

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,180
involved with signing up everyone on the

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,830
team signed up for all of the slack

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,810
channels and some of the other forms of

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,280
people were talking in and instead of

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,240
just sitting there kind of watching we

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,430
wanted to introduce ourselves

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,350
individually and you know it all became

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,820
part of the daily work stream to pay

00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,350
attention to what was happening on these

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,800
channels and what people were talking

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,840
about and also to you know offer some

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,130
sort of insight whenever you could all

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,110
the people that we were working on our

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,300
team had all come from a geo backgrounds

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,920
the great percentage of them had all

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,010
worked in the digital mapping space and

00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,430
so there was a fairly decent well of

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,450
experience that everyone control from so

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,270
another thing that we came across was

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,700
obviously the change sets so we've all

00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,040
we all know that the comments on change

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,010
sets can be helpful or they can be a

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,320
little bit harsh and so my first change

00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,060
that comment was a pretty good lesson

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,380
when I went in and mess around with a

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,900
higher priority road in Western

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,850
Australia the local para mapper there

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,680
was pretty Swift to let me know that

00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,880
I've made a pretty poor at it on it and

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,730
so who he had reverted my chainset which

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,070
is obviously not good but what he also

00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,710
told me was he saw that there like I'd

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,360
given my sources what I convey to him

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,580
what he came back was what he gave me

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,510
tremendously helpful advice about where

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,610
there was one of the governmental

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,140
websites there was we were able to use

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,350
to confirm when these these higher

00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,150
construction projects were finishing up

00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,680
and on top of that I came back and we

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,210
started a little dialogue and he told me

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,190
oh this is like the aerial imagery

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,350
that's best up-to-date this is another

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,970
one like this is terribly Advait and you

00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,170
know aerial imagery assets are always

00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,450
difficult to tell which is the most

00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,130
up-to-date without just study in them so

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,300
from this we just realized you know the

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,220
best way to go into each of these

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,350
localities was possibly go around using

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,870
that who's around me tool to see who's

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,820
active and who's up-to-date and who's

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,140
involved with it and ask them you know

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,120
we're gonna come in this is what we're

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,340
planning on doing this is the data set

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,620
that we've been approved to use so any

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,180
advice or tips or anything like that and

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,890
every single person that we asked came

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,350
back and said oh yeah this is what you

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,850
should know

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,180
you know there's no apostrophes in that

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,790
data set or they're missing spaces here

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,230
is good imagery assets to use and so

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,710
again it was a really really positive

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,270
response and so after that we realized

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,710
yeah you know this is the way to go and

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,460
so it started off really on the right

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,630
foot and so with all of this sort of in

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,250
place and us moving in there and

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,510
starting to do this we've started

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,790
setting up some of the projects that

00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,530
we're gonna get to right so looking at

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,910
all these we had this sort of balance we

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,320
have to strike between every one of the

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,270
projects that we went to you know what

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,400
are the LSM guidelines what are the

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,830
local policies how do they apply them

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,000
and what are the subtle nuances that

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,800
they have with their sort of way of

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
mapping and then what is the sort of

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,430
structure that we want to put in place

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,770
where do we fit between that as well as

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,360
like you know balancing what Microsoft

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,880
has set us to do for their priority list

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,710
so each of the projects that we did this

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,440
is sort of the way that we approach the

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,900
design of it

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,370
so these today they're all the lists of

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,750
all of the projects that we've done I

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,220
think it's important to say that every

00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,080
single one of these habits was done by

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,750
person there was no automated evidence

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,640
or anything like that and so I said it's

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,470
really roads that we're going after so

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,570
straightaway we're looking at the the

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,340
geometry the surface is the completeness

00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,130
of it and so when we're talking about

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,140
completeness we're looking at you know

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,850
we have three basic sources that we can

00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,550
look at for almost all of these right we

00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:06,800
have what to know SM what's available to

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,420
use from the government and then we had

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,430
a corroborated source that we could sort

00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,300
of compare these two against to see how

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:16,070
does that stand up to either of these so

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,780
geometry and surfaces and completeness

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,460
that was all sort of stuff that we could

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,010
kind of break up into territories into

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,900
grids and work off of them to what we

00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,260
saw and so we went after like you know

00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,610
the top the top prioritized localities

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,220
for all of these and sort of work that

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,990
outwards that way another thing that we

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,310
were really really concerned about was

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,440
like do we have enough turn restrictions

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,900
it's very hard to tell are all of these

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,940
going to be in place and so looking at

00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,530
that we had got some license probe data

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,510
and from that we were able to look at

00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,540
over 50,000 possible turn restrictions

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,760
that were absent from the data and then

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,520
looking at that we were able to add

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,610
about 16,000 turn restrictions that were

00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,260
in place verifying it through like air

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,800
imagery and the road markings ooh we can

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,600
see from there and so these three

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,070
sources sort of triangulate in them and

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,500
trying to find out where the gaps were

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,329
were really really helpful and the dev

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,640
team of reserva did some great work

00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:11,350
looking at creating some algorithms and

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,350
these comparisons when it came to things

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,790
like the road name so we had all of

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,470
these sort of falling under the same

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,180
thing with slight tweaks to sort of the

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,519
algorithm of how they compared them and

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,740
so we had you know invalid candidates

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,290
spoke about kind of like very close but

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,870
not quite the same Spelling's the

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,730
conflicting suffixes was the difference

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,380
between sydney lane and sydney avenue

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,120
and then going in and trying to verify

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,399
through the government source just which

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,529
one was correct and so all in all we

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,160
ended up fixing about 10,000 of these

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:43,690
street names in the data there and that

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,399
was all through these three sources

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,670
would sort of look at in order to kind

00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,200
of figure out what was what and so using

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,820
that what we did was we used a

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,950
combination of what was available in

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,660
oakland open source so we used a lot of

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,420
justin we didn't use an awful lot of ID

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,430
editor and so we were also all using

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,160
QGIS one side of that to load some of

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,360
the datasets to have a look at and

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,440
additionally that we also looked at some

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,449
of the other ones and some of the

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,250
internal tools but this was all well and

00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:10,959
good but what we really wanted to know

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,970
is that we weren't really interested in

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,320
terms of like how many edits were being

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,690
made it was really about sort of the

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,220
quality of them and so we went in to try

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,690
and figure out well how can we look at

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,209
these at the beginning we were using a

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,860
OSN Chow as these were coming up they're

00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:25,870
already published so it's not much used

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,250
to kind of go through that way and so

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,199
what we had to do was we had to devise

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,670
that kind of a human and also an

00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:32,260
internal way of doing this and we looked

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,029
around in another open source tool it

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,360
was there was the humanitarian

00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:39,070
OpenStreetMap task master so we looked

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,079
at this and what we did was we brought

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,630
this in and what the team developed was

00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:46,449
a plugin that allowed us to take a time

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,670
from the OSF server an editor could work

00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:50,860
on it as usual then upload it to a

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,750
Microsoft server that could then be

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,699
downloaded again and validated and

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,529
either sent back for fixing or else

00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:58,360
moved on to publishing and then checked

00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:01,329
again and put up to the OSF server so

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,800
and this had two sets of eyes looking on

00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:06,720
each of the edits before we published

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,430
them out onto our back onto OSM and

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,560
and within that we started developing

00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,120
their own internal paint styles so that

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,190
we could see you know whatever was

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,540
brought down from the Microsoft server I

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,610
had been given a different tag and we

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,620
could look at that and see okay this has

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,060
been touched by the editor and we need

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,069
to go in and verify these particular

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,490
edits that they've made and so this

00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:28,949
greatly speeded up the time so the thing

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,120
was that like you know how did this all

00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:31,889
come about or what were the actual

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,199
results of this work that we don't over

00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:35,850
the last several months so looking at it

00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:37,319
we could see right away I think that's

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,660
what the 19th you could go in and see

00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:41,660
that like nine of the top 27 editors in

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:45,540
Australia all belong to the editing team

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,850
all in all we added 35,000 kilometers of

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,769
new roads 22,000 kilometers and you

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,319
named roads bunch of turn restrictions

00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:54,209
and then also we're cleaning out Osmos

00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:56,129
issues as we went around resulting at

00:11:54,209 --> 00:12:02,759
about 62 feds in different change sets

00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:07,370
that we did and so I suppose those were

00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,370
all numbers what was the actual effect

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,910
variable all right so this was the

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:18,569
actual effect of what we got of God out

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:20,610
of this so along the y-axis here or yes

00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:23,699
sorry along the side here we can see

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,110
that these all say p5 up to P 11 and so

00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,880
what they represented what we called

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,790
planet builds and the planet build is

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,470
basically a snapshot of the OSM data at

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,420
a given time that we can sort of take

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,220
down and just sort of do evaluations on

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,589
and these are probably taking every

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:42,540
about every eight weeks on average so

00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:46,350
this spans back a bit quite a few months

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,910
and so along the x-axis what we were

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,519
looking at was what are the rates of

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,439
change and so the blue was represents

00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,290
named roads while the green represents

00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,939
total roads and so between each of these

00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,040
builds every eight weeks were seeing a

00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:00,750
rate of growth within both of those

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,059
features between one and a half and two

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,500
percent and the father went along

00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:08,040
obviously the gaps were getting a little

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,980
bit closer and a bad planet ten started

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,809
that build started in November so that

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,880
was the start of the editorial team and

00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:17,040
while we can't be like completely sure

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,520
but we can probably say quite well that

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,260
we did certainly contribute to that

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,510
ready growth that we've seen from the

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,850
previous planet builds in those two

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,230
aspects and so we didn't measure the

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,540
turn restrictions or some of the other

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,430
aspects such as road surfaces but we

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,560
certainly saw that it was kind of moving

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:38,740
all in the right direction and so yeah

00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:42,830
and here are all the people that did a

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:47,990
very helpful bunch you'd say mmm

00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:49,640
but yeah between them and we were pretty

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,200
pleased with the work that we did and so

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,910
what we can say is that like we were

00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,950
moving all in the right direction and

00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,530
obviously the further that we go on we

00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:00,260
can reduce some of these processes sort

00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:02,150
of increase the tools and make a better

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,560
availability of the open source stuff

00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,570
that's available while also being able

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,110
to give some of that back to the open

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:11,390
source community themselves and yeah I

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:16,370
think I actually beat the times that I

00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:30,320
their practice this presentation in so

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:33,140
yeah really nice we have a lot of time

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:40,550
for questions and we have already some

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:43,970
questions the result of your efforts go

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:46,100
into Microsoft Bing Maps or other other

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:50,090
product very clear are these those

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,590
results of your work going to well what

00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,390
will happen was they will we're really

00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,460
only just looking at that base road map

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,900
of Australia and so the road map of what

00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,250
we'll work on and what features will

00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,290
work on it's still sort of to be

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,610
determined and so we're just trying to

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,260
close out what we're doing there in the

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,670
Australia thing but there wouldn't

00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,690
really be any limit in terms if you

00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,750
wanted to look out there

00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,740
water bodies or national parks or

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,630
something like that you could really

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,630
look at I think any sort of tier of them

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:22,100
so I'm curious to know why Australia

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,800
like from a Microsoft perspective any

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,690
particular reasons and like how do you

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,910
intend to sort of continue this work

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,890
like reach the VA or like within

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,170
Australia like now that it seems like

00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:35,329
okay this project has gone on very sick

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,120
yes Willie so like what are the next

00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:41,899
steps for you guys internally how are

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,029
you thinking about it and will we the

00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,350
the next steps initially what we went

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:47,510
after Australia was because it was a

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,930
large market but it also had a fairly

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:54,829
thriving open OpenStreetMap community

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,870
and a pretty reasonable open source open

00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,130
openness towards the approach what we

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,290
were looking for for the open source

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,760
data so because of that that made sort

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:07,130
of a good reason to sort of go in there

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,899
and then you know as I say in the

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,610
roadmap of where we warp into next is

00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,050
sort of still to be determined so we're

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,230
still working on that data within

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,880
Australia and so we still have to kind

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,130
of see what are some of the other gaps

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,170
we can continue to kind of come together

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,170
and sort of fix and editor coordinate

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,270
hi I think that at the baguettes at the

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:38,250
beginning Microsoft had some

00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:40,730
requirements or some expectation before

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:45,000
starting and so my question is after

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:49,920
completed did this test all the

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,020
requirements were satisfied or I mean

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,140
which was the rate of the satisfaction

00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:57,180
at the end of the experiment well I

00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,890
think the best way we're gonna be able

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,140
to see it is just how they have people

00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,850
react to when when those roads you know

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,380
get released onto the Bing Maps and so

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,970
when they start releasing those roads

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,130
right there we'll be able to sort of

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,290
judge had the users who looked at it I

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,120
will there be some sort of comparison

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,680
before with what was in the Bing Maps

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,140
there and so I think that will be

00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,830
probably like the the greatest sort of

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,780
test case promise like I said I think

00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,890
one of the most important things was

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,960
just how it was welcomed by the

00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,760
OpenStreetMap community it it takes an

00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,400
awful lot of work to build up the two or

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,230
sorry it takes a lot of work to build up

00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,880
trust but it can take like you know one

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,890
really bad mistake and that can all be

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,150
sort of shattered and so to that we're

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,010
looking at and they're looking at it

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,040
like both of those kind of lenses on it

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,810
and and so far so good but yeah well see

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:48,960
I will see let's together users in

00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:51,930
Australia think of it one what was

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,210
Microsoft using prior to sourcing roads

00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:58,860
from OpenStreetMap and the second part

00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:00,660
is it's Microsoft using a download from

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,590
OpenStreetMap when pushing it to Bing

00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:07,260
Maps or is there being value added to it

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,430
post extract that is to say is if things

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,260
are being pushed back up into Open

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,000
Street Map which is improving the roads

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,460
Network for all of Australia is that

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,090
exactly what is being used in Bing or is

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,220
it just feeding into a larger data set

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,350
yes so so Bing as its own provider at

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,000
the moment and so that that the open

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,980
door the OpenStreetMap data that we've

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,130
fixed will be sort of piped in that way

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,690
and but everything is done then on

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,250
OpenStreetMaps and then we just take it

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,010
down from there and then we input that

00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:37,020
into into the Bing so yeah that will

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,340
slowly sort of happen over time we'll be

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,340
able to sort of move that in there

00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:47,820
Howard how are you validating down

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,950
restrictions sorry I know you guys have

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,480
done a lot of restrictions is there like

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,700
a validation mechanism to know that the

00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,680
restrictions are correct or like are you

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,030
getting any feedback is there like a

00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,520
mechanism in which you know okay

00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,080
probably something is wrong and well the

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,610
way that we were able we were only able

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,980
to sort of add it when we were positive

00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:06,510
so that's why we only had 16,000 ones

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,310
that we could do and that we were able

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,230
to confirm but I like looking at the

00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,360
aerial imagery where a mandatory road

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,250
would have there would be a turn on the

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,920
road there would be left there if not

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:19,020
what we would do is we would leave a map

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,460
note or else to fix me on it and request

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,470
one of the local users to go and have a

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,450
look at it and they can get around to it

00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,450
whenever they sort of did or town

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,220
everybody on this side of the room

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,970
please ask question also on the other

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,160
side are you are you looking to roll in

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,860
program out wider to other areas of the

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,360
world yeah I think that's the the

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,950
intention would certainly be there that

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,860
not like leave it stand alone within

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,450
Australia I think I think that that that

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,580
would be just a decision that would be

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,800
made sort of higher up in terms of like

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,840
what what verified being the next sort

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,120
of best markets to go after and hide

00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,590
that figured into their their evaluation

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,020
of what markets were more important but

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:05,420
the ideas for the plan to people on role

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,420
in the area I hope so anyway yeah

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,190
so if there are no more questions we can

00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:21,650
thank our speaker

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:21,650
