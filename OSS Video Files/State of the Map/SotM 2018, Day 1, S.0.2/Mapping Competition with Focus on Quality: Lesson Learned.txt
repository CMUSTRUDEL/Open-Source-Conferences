Most, if not all, mapping competition have tendency to focus on quantity. While it was fairly easy to count on how many object have been mapped and to determine the winner, the quality of edits usually suffers. To overcome this, we developed and hosted UniBattleMapping competition in 2017, participated by 50 mapping team from 17 universities in Indonesia. This competition put emphasize on the quality of the edits. Every team contribution is checked using several validation tools. If error was found, it would reduce the points acquired from the numbers of objects added. This session will share the methodology, tools and lessons learned from the competition.

okay good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,940
so I hope you had a good coffee during

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,289
the break so your you'll be stay awake

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,730
during this session okay so let me to

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,620
lose myself my name is Ian T Sajadi

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,570
currently I'm the country manager for

00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,550
Indonesia for humanitarian opens map

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,690
team so this is based on our experience

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,000
having the Uni battle mapping last year

00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:33,090
it's a new concept of competition that

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,489
we tried out and it goes really well and

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:41,039
we want to share you the experience and

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:43,320
what are some of the keynotes so a bit

00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,719
of passive story about the competition

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,980
itself we've had our first competition

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,839
in 2012 at that time we we have go to

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,309
map padam for tsunami and earthquake

00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:58,440
preparation pardon is got a quite big

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,210
earthquake several years before and we

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,159
think that it will be good if we can map

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,489
atom city so then for the next

00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:08,700
earthquake we can prepare on where's the

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:11,399
evacuation can where is the evacuation

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,070
routes that was can be designated for

00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:18,840
this kind of activities and this is how

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:24,840
it goes let me jump in into second

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:27,539
minute okay so here is padam so

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,270
initially it's quite blank in 2011 and

00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:32,909
then we start initiated okay let's have

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,369
a competition a mapping competition for

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,490
student so this is for individual

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:42,270
student and then this is all sorry this

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,990
is also like the first time when tasking

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,990
manager was passed out for a large-scale

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,990
mapping

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,509
discriminated was launched and then as

00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:02,170
you can see the data is explode in

00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:04,560
Padang in less than six months it seems

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,420
like goes really well especially because

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,420
the data that was used from the mapping

00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,099
activities is it was then introduced to

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,410
disaster manager so then they can

00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,090
understand better about their area where

00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,379
they live and also to partners that they

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,140
can use the data for a better

00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:22,090
preparation during disaster but what not

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,879
goes really well is with the competition

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,280
those who won the competition flown to

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,970
Denver to join the foss4g at that time

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,680
but what goes not really well is when

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,319
they won the competition and they get

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,230
back to Indonesia the first winner of

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,910
the competition they decided no I didn't

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,579
want I don't want to do mapping anymore

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,379
I want to work for insurance company so

00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,660
we're thinking okay that's not maybe a

00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:49,690
result that we expected of continuing

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:53,470
and so on having student to keep on

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:57,420
mapping their own area and then second

00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:00,250
try out that we have is in 2013 up until

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,980
2015 we have University Roadshow project

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,170
and then we also have similar mapping

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,480
competition built in when we do the

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,030
socialization and training because we

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,190
introduced them to osm and then also the

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:17,370
qgs on how they can use the data and

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:20,049
that for this it goes quite well because

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,769
as the student if you're having more

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,930
enthusiasm about osm and some of them

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:29,319
keep keen on mapping one particular

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,299
University is Hasanuddin University in

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,060
Makassar because their lecturer is

00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,769
really get into OpenStreetMap even he

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,200
make it compulsory for the student to

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,989
map their own City he make it part of

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,630
the university assignment so that every

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,930
student need to map 500 building and 100

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:50,470
road networks and they also make the

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:53,079
mark as a quality assurance measurement

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:56,410
so if you map a city really well he will

00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:59,769
give you an A if you goes not to need

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:02,410
like the building is a bit shift then

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,930
you get B and then or then you can see D

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,480
or etc so the student will get

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,180
understand that okay so if

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,580
I want to get an A then I have to map an

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,970
area properly so we think that oh this

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,519
is a really good story on how that the

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,650
lecturer itself already understand about

00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,549
the importance of having a good and

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,470
quality

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:29,620
having a quality data and then also one

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,380
of the reason of why we think that we

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,570
want to try a competition with focus on

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,900
data quality is that we have this module

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,490
we also share we also translate the

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,010
module as well on the data quality

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,650
assurance this is more on the

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,840
intermediate material for those who

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,580
already customized a customized in

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,860
mapping in RSM so then they want to

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,510
leverage that capability they want to

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,699
know more about how to validate so we

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,080
teach I mean we give introduction on

00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,600
Safarov allocation tool that they can

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,520
use they can check a contribution based

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,289
on a user or like in a particular area

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,900
and how they can check the data quality

00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:08,169
for that area so we're thinking of why

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,210
don't we how like what is the best way

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,180
on we can socialize this new training

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,680
material for this initial - it was

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:21,010
already quite well-known in Indonesia so

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,289
then we so we decide let's prepare for

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,820
let's make a universal mapping let's

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,650
create a competition that we haven't

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,400
done before that is focused on the

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,289
quality so we make it a requirement for

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,700
all the team so this is like more team

00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:36,729
effort rather than individual

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,470
contribution we asked them to form a

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:40,539
group consists of three University

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,910
students you have an RSM user account

00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:45,039
definitely and you need to understand on

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,960
how to contribute and validate will tell

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,419
you later on how we checking that and

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,190
then there's also multiple team from a

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:53,020
universities allowed yep during

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,180
elimination round only one team can

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,889
represent their University so if you

00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,419
join the competition and you're the only

00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,840
team from that University then you

00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:03,340
directly goes into final and then you

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,770
need to follow the Instagram account

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,320
this is also our first time at Instagram

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,820
so I think it is important if you want

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,130
to reach out the student then you need

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:15,310
to have presence in the social media

00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,260
channel that they have we cannot keep on

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,700
being in mailing list for example in our

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,990
case you know SM Indonesia

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,840
mailing list traffic is like

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,540
or two emails per year but in facebook

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,170
we have 3,000 or than 3,000 group 3,000

00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,450
members so more communication done in a

00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,690
new social media channel so that's why

00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,190
we make it also that they need to follow

00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,660
our Instagram account and they need to

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,910
read with the initial you need better

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,130
mapping publication so that other team

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:46,880
can join or like other University can

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:49,130
also know about it and they can also

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,020
join it and then we also set up the

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,210
specific social media channel we have

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,510
two website but we create a specific

00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,160
page for the better mapping and then we

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,560
have the Twitter account that regularly

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,850
tweets and remind them about hey you

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,280
need to map you already have like a

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:10,370
couple of days and then we also set up a

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:12,020
line account and then so this is we also

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,990
prepare the scoring criteria and

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,270
competition rule those team lead to map

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,280
at their own designated area usually the

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,910
designated area is the area where they

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,030
live so because we think that this

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,940
student lives in that area so then they

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,670
need to map that area especially if like

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:33,020
if there's a city then we usually and

00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,330
then there's two University from the

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,210
same city then we we defined that area

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,190
or we look at adjacent area or area

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,690
surrounding where they live so it is

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,480
expected that they only map their own

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,400
area not mapping other area and then

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,040
they are can only use the pre-register

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,500
4sm account and one account can only be

00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,360
used by one person if it is found out

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,070
that one account being used by multiple

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,500
person then he or she will get

00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,240
disqualified and then we need them to

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,550
use chosen because just already has like

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,340
validation tools built in to check the

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,160
error and warning and we need them to

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:10,460
adhere to the OSM mapping guideline we

00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,140
have the wiki pages for Indonesia the

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,480
object reference because usually what's

00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,370
in the global SM pages doesn't look

00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,930
similar with what exists in Indonesia

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,360
for the road for example the primary

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,950
roads in UK is definitely different with

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,590
the primary roads in Indonesia so then

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,740
we provide that kind of reference on so

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:30,830
that they can determine what is the

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:33,279
correct row type for example and then it

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,019
focus on three object for this building

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,709
and then the second highway this is the

00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:40,029
type of highway that we map and then the

00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:42,779
amenity and there are many people on the

00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,920
focus on trading schools and then or

00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:47,170
education facility and then health

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,879
facility and also a place of worship

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,279
this is also aligned with our

00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,930
humanitarian spirit because during

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,769
disaster this three place is really

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:58,629
useful and for a pet for a manatee we

00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,370
make it compulsory for them to add at

00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:04,199
least name and address if they have

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:06,699
another than yeah that would be okay I

00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:10,029
promise you this is the last site with

00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:11,769
so many tags so bear with me okay so the

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:15,040
scoring criteria and competition rule is

00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:17,370
that for building you get zero point to

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,899
point for each object that you map

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:23,110
highway you get zero point five and

00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:25,209
amenity you get zero point five but we

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,459
do have the point deduction usually in

00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:29,050
our previous mapping competition we do

00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,220
also have regular mapping competition

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,379
usually we are the one who do the

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,089
validation we are fixing the one I mean

00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:35,949
sometimes people can feel freely proud

00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,329
oh I already met one thousand building

00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:39,430
but they didn't know that that one

00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:41,379
thousand building is it's not really

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,029
correct or there's some error it says

00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,050
some worrying that they need to fix so

00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:46,480
he may be

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,970
he or she may be feeling proud but him

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,750
he or she may not really contribute to

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:56,040
the OSM so we we ask them to also

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:58,360
validate their works so because we also

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,490
remind them that if we are not

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,500
validating their work then they will get

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,870
point deduction so if it's not aligned

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,790
with the imagery this is the example we

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,649
also specified what imagery that they

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,259
need to use so then it will be aligned

00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,269
with the imagery so like for example

00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:16,089
like that one it's not really aligned

00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:17,920
with the building and then wrong tagging

00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,809
if they put the wrong tagging like

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,279
building they put building on roads or

00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:25,629
they put build yeah so there is there

00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,790
will be like deduction for that and also

00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:30,819
minus 3 for the amenity you need to be

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:33,490
like more careful for amenity and there

00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:36,220
is also if if you found out if it's be

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,920
fine found out error during Joseph's

00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,350
validation then there will be more point

00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,360
deduction so that's why we expect them

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,829
to do validation themselves we give them

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,319
time to be that kind of validation

00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:49,720
before

00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:52,059
before we mark them ourselves so this is

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,399
what's quite fatal this is minus 20 if

00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:56,139
you only map the buildings but you

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,790
didn't map the road networks so it seems

00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:59,589
like on the map you know SM it's like a

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,689
bunch of building but there is no road

00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:07,480
access to there for that one we give

00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:09,939
them like a minus 20 so the first step

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,189
that we did is we do the socialization

00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:15,309
about the rule and regulation we have

00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:17,129
the road show although not all

00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:19,689
University image

00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:21,550
we're not visited during the road show

00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:23,470
but there are other universes they

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,300
joined but because we already provide

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,819
all the guideline for the competition

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,740
they can also join or if they're live

00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:32,740
near in one of the road show that we

00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,540
come to then definitely they can also

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,759
join in with that University to

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,379
understand more about the regulation and

00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:42,879
then how they can participate in the

00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:44,559
competition some get really quite a lot

00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,480
of participant for example in that

00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,519
corner you can see that if and all if

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,029
most of the lecturers also come and

00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,860
having their special uniform and then

00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:56,079
others can have like only like 5

00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,360
participant during socialization it's it

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,490
seems like a consultation or something

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,319
but they actually one of the winner of

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,059
the competition later so it's

00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:06,639
interesting that not necessary that all

00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:12,220
the groups that really crowded will be

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:14,050
like come forward and then during

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,629
registration we also give them the

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:24,610
initial test so there is a test before

00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:26,199
they can join the competition let me

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,540
just give you an offer fee on the pass

00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:34,269
so we test them their knowledge about

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,069
OSM so like this one so this is is it

00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:38,050
warning or isis error and how do you

00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:41,139
solve this problem and then like this

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,730
one so what's wrong about this picture

00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:45,819
and how do you solve it as you can see

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:48,370
that each node in this building is like

00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:51,309
inspect as a building not the entire

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,689
polygon but like individual nodes and

00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:53,410
then like this one what's wrong about

00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,139
this picture

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,240
can you explain so as you can see that

00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:01,120
there are 50 response from

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,580
team and all the team that got mark

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,770
below 60 they will be disqualified

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,209
they cannot join the competition so we

00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:10,720
only asked the team that already

00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:20,649
understand about how to map it correctly

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:23,560
or properly so from out of 50 University

00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:25,180
teams that register 33 of them passed

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,779
the selection pass and this is the

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:33,130
thirty three teams from more than ten

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:35,140
University all over Indonesia and as I

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,089
explained in the beginning that if

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,860
you're the only team that register from

00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,480
one particular University then you

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,220
automatically goes into final round

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,230
underneath you join the elimination

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,850
round because they're gone there can be

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:51,760
only one team that represent one

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:54,160
University and then when they start the

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,959
elimination round we keep on updated

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,880
about how's the progress we kept on

00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,290
updated about okay you have like four

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,209
days you have three days you have two

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:04,300
days you have one day start validating

00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:07,329
and then we also provide them with like

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,760
the scoring of their or of their edits

00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:12,010
but we make a disclaimer that this

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,100
number of object is not less certainly

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,959
the final score because we need to check

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,839
and validate their works or their

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,700
contribution so it's not deducted yep so

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,730
it can be like you can like have higher

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:29,440
number but the real score that you have

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:31,060
might be minus and then in elimination

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,370
round again we will remind them that

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,350
yeah we didn't they also need to check

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,540
and as you can see there are also

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:41,740
changes like in universe test Indonesia

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:47,290
here route aqueous only 24 and then geo

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:50,800
is 4000 and pattern here it rules 2050

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:54,370
SGO seems like 12,000 it's like really a

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:58,260
lot but then the one that passed through

00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:01,240
is the route aku not the FPS tu

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:04,029
apparently because they asked one of the

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,640
team member of that particular team they

00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,829
met so many mistake they they've done so

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,649
many mistake that the rhythm end result

00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:13,509
is minus 3000 their point

00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:15,490
but that seems a lot but there's

00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:17,199
actually another team from one of the

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,470
university I won't mentioned that have

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,959
the final score of minus 8000 meaning

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,990
that they did so many mistake that yeah

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,610
there that's their the record and my

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,139
team said that this is like the most

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,329
plot twists in the competition because

00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,279
there is a a guide that map really well

00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,079
but one of the team member

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,819
make it a minus so then they get

00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:43,509
disqualified from the final round and

00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:44,860
the final round we we make the the

00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,300
elimination round goes for like three

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,369
days of mapping and two days of

00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,929
validation well on the final round we

00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:52,779
give them five days for mapping and

00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:55,629
three days for validation again we we

00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:58,240
ask them to validate their works because

00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:00,519
if not what seems high in this can can

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,999
mislead for example like on this one

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:06,069
number one is space-time the number two

00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:08,230
is Empire State that's the name of the

00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:08,819
team and then the third place is geo

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:13,629
enema

00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:14,920
but it seems like Oh probably this is

00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:19,209
like the first second and the third

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:21,009
winner oh yeah the cash prize for the

00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:22,959
competition why the student really eager

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:25,449
to join we give them case price of

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:29,829
fifteen million rupiah well that seems

00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:31,749
like a lot but yeah these 15 million

00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:34,089
means that just the student will be

00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:36,759
millionaire no because 1 million rupiah

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:38,559
in Indonesia is just like 60 euro so

00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:41,230
you're not really that millionaire sir

00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,649
but still it's it's an amount that as

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:46,959
you don't really enjoy and the winner is

00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:48,579
the the third winner is the fourth place

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,839
because the third winner is actually

00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:54,519
having - several thousand so yeah it's

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,199
good that you contribute a lot you map

00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:59,139
so many building you map so many roads

00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:02,439
but it would be bad if you didn't have a

00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:04,720
good quality insurance to build in and

00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:06,610
the good thing the good news and how we

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,100
try to follow up is that on the

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,049
aftermath the winner of the unit battle

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,390
mapping is becoming the first youth

00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:16,209
mapper chapter in Indonesia so I think

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:18,640
because after the competition we try to

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:21,610
encourage the participant if you want to

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,199
join newspaper then let us help you in

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,139
doing that

00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:28,019
so the course of the this competition is

00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:30,960
from September to November it's only

00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:32,429
like two months but several key lesson

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,350
learned that we got its quantity and

00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:37,350
quality are both important we cannot

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:40,649
rely on one fairy and one only one

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:42,299
aspect we need both and competition is a

00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:43,649
good a very good way of learning it's

00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,940
also to prepare them to be a

00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:48,359
professional that you need to be

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,100
responsible on your work and it is also

00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,409
important on how we can make it

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,799
sustainable and this is why the youth

00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:55,259
mapper

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,720
and then other effort that we're doing

00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:00,029
is trying to make it sustainable on

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,340
making some of the campuses as one of

00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:04,950
the OSM hub in Indonesia so then they

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,720
can continue to grow and last but not

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:21,570
least this is all the people that joined

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:23,759
in in this effort thank you very much we

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,970
we now have time for some questions from

00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,970
the audience

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:35,750
if there are plan to have another uni

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,760
battle anytime soon

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:42,380
we are in thought with grep on that

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,720
whatever and I'm sorry if you talked

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,360
about this but is it was a competition

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,289
to map the city the university is in

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,570
yeah so in a future competition would it

00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:55,159
be going beyond just the city that the

00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,289
university is and since that would be

00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,270
well mapped what are what areas are you

00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:01,669
thinking about including in a

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:04,580
competition yeah as you can see like in

00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:07,669
in the in the area where we doing the

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,289
roadshow it is still mostly concentrated

00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:11,450
in Jaffa Island we are looking ways on

00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:13,880
how we can do this in different other

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,590
major island in Indonesia and especially

00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,590
because not in all universes in

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,179
Indonesia is in the major city some of

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,070
them is also in suburb so we're

00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:23,720
expecting that those in the suburb can

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,470
also joins and they can map their own

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,470
area as well

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,710
thank you thank you for the talk

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:42,320
very interesting do you said that there

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:45,470
are some competitors who actually are so

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,360
so bad that they have like - 3000 or -

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,690
8000 or something

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,880
who's going to sort of clean that up I

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,290
mean apparently if it's so bad it needs

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,330
some cleaning up because there will be

00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:59,180
lots of that data will you then just

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:02,270
remove it entirely or will someone else

00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:04,700
look at it and repair it or what's going

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:07,460
to happen with that it's our own

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,770
internal team who doing the validation

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,200
so but if we found out that there are so

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,630
many errors we delete that so we also

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,910
initially also socialized that that if

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,740
you provide bad contribution then we

00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:23,960
need we may need to delete that as well

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:27,410
their contributions for you hello and

00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:30,560
how many of the participants of the

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:33,980
contest continue mapping afterwards so

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,770
what is the intention we haven't really

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,020
checked on that one but some of them

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,880
keep on mapping and like we involved

00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:44,180
them in several of our activities as

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,340
well like the first time they say that

00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,290
because they're a final-year student so

00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,300
they asked our assistant in giving

00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:52,010
training on OS m so now they already

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,020
passed the pattern and they already

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,630
register facial register map use mapper

00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:59,120
a chapter the first one in indonesia and

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,850
then for the virtual mada university

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,260
they also helped us in another mapathon

00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,440
with work foot program

00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,360
I think that's next month so yeah I dare

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,900
keep on engage and involved in the

00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,900
mapping itself

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,940
okay so what's as far as I understood

00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:18,650
one of the things that should be

00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,930
improved if you are going to repeat if

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:27,260
the initiative is to reduce the number

00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:31,400
of say of mistakes and the question is

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:33,830
do you think that this part can be

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,810
improved and know by improving the

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,960
training before you know starting the

00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:41,420
competition or did you think to any

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,470
specific action to reduce this the issue

00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,100
yeah so far what we planned before we

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,230
have this

00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,760
van is that we provide them not only

00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,760
with the guidelines that they can read

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,559
but we also provide on several videos in

00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,480
our YouTube channel so that they can

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,820
learn and watch it directly but although

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,350
we already provide that mechanism we do

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,390
not we do not provide training because

00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,620
it will be unfair if for one University

00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,390
we give them training but for other

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,710
University we didn't give them training

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,890
so we want to give them the level

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:12,020
playing area I mean by by self learning

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,750
it is hopefully that they can understand

00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:18,429
about the quality that is expected from

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,429
the edits in osm so yeah

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,409
so if there are no other questions we

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,409
