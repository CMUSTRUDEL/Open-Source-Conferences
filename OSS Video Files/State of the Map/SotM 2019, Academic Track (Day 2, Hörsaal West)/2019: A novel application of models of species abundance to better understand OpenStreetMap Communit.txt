Title: 2019: A novel application of models of species abundance to better understand OpenStreetMap Communit
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Academic Track (Day 2, Hörsaal West)
Description: 
	The OpenStreetMap (OSM) community is a global community crossing cultures, languages, and geographical boundaries. Researchers have been working to develop automated approaches to understanding the composition of this community through their contributions to the OSM database. In this talk we propose a new and novel application of theories and models of species abundance from ecological science to understand contributor community structure and distributions in OSM.

**Motivation: **
Community is a word that evokes different images for different people. Socially, we as humans require interaction with other people and society is built around people coming together into social groups we call ‘community’.  Communities identify different groups and very often the bond within these communities in a set of shared goals and the division of sharing of labour and skills among other resources. Indeed some scholars believe that the feeling of contributing positively to our own communities is one of the most fundamental feelings of satisfaction in life (Proctor, 2013).  In all of these ways the now millions of contributors to OSM form the OSM Community. Attempts to understand how the OSM community works have appeared in the academic literature. Amongst the research community there is a curiosity and fascination about the OSM community given: the global extent of OSM crossing cultures, geographical boundaries and languages; the altruistic nature of its members; and its obvious success as a primarily Internet-based community different to almost every non-crowdsourced community we know from our everyday lives. 

**State of the Art: ** In this talk we shall argue that the model of community required for OSM is more nuanced that many of the current quantitative approaches. Neis et al (2013) amongst others have used concepts of junior, senior, local, external mappers which does capture the distribution of contributors to OSM well. OSM has been shown to loosely adhere to the 90-9-1 rule of Neilsen (2012) which highlights that about 90% of the members of community-based projects are usually only consuming the collaboratively collected information, while 9% occasionally contributes to the project and only 1% demonstrate a very active pattern of contribution of activity.  As Begin (2018; PhD Thesis) argues 'characterizing Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) data requires understanding contributors’ behaviour and many typologies of contributors are proposed in an attempt to link VGI contributors with the nature of the data they provide'.  In Begin et al (2018) the authors identifies the different phases of contributor life cycle from a temporal perspective as a contributor's lifespan is a 'university metric'. In a more computationally complex approach Truong et al (2018) develop a multigraph approach with data mining to characterise individuals and identify behavioural groups. The implementation of a multiplex network based on an OSM data sample and an initial analysis make it possible to identify useful behaviours.
 
 
**Methodology**: We consider a very novel approach to community identification and understanding by borrowing concepts and methodologies from theories and models of species abundance to the individual contributors of the OSM community. This is a novel approach in VGI but a decades old and mature branch of Ecological Science. As Hughes (1986) points out "It is a common observation that in samples from animal and plant communities most of the individuals belong to a small number of abundant species, whereas most of the species are represented by a small number of individuals". In OSM we see that most individual contributors make a small number of edits. However, from the global OSM community, a small number of species (groupings) are represented by a small number of contributors. For example contributors who have contributed thousands of GPS traces or thousands of building objects. 

We use the OSM Planet History data for a number of selected regions to consider the contribution history of those OSM community members who have contributed in those regions. All software is developed in Python. We then develop and apply the Community Level Modesl (CLMs) from Maguire et al (2016) and others. We define different types of OSM community member species. Species characteristics are based on contribution history and patterns and can be easily changed. For example, we may create a species which are differentiated by the number of OSM Relations they have created/edited. We could decide on three species groups: 0 - 10 relations, 10 - 100 relations or greater than 100. More sophisticated species can be developed. CLMs allow the creation of a species co-occurrence matrix to environmental variables (such as quantity of edits, types of tagging used, etc) which allows

so the final presentation is my own so

00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,440
this will be

00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:21,520
so I need to apply the same standards to

00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:24,590
myself as I did to everyone else Hey so

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm winning the award probably for the

00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:31,279
longest title at the conference

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,829
that's what academics do big titles may

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,350
not necessarily mean big findings but

00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:39,829
this is something that I've been working

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:42,410
on for quite a while on my own actually

00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,430
I've tried to get some students involved

00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,469
and they're not interested at the moment

00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,290
so if there's people interested in

00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:52,160
collaborating I'd be happy to here yeah

00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:55,340
I've always been interested in osm in

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,620
the idea of the community and what is it

00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,290
that makes this community very special

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,020
and is there some computer science ways

00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,100
that we can look at the community and if

00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,890
we look at this from a dictionary

00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,540
definition point of view we can see the

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,560
oxford english dictionary has lots of

00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,149
different definitions of community and

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,159
it's what we really understand from

00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:20,210
community a body of people share in some

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,610
culture culture or ethnic identity maybe

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,710
in today's world it's an online facility

00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,930
where users may be not called people but

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:31,610
users can share information or data or

00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,680
topics etc but then linking into my talk

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,720
today a community can also be a group of

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,960
animals or plants in the same place that

00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,790
are sharing the conditions of the

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,700
environment that there they are living

00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,439
in and this is what some of the OSM

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,369
community looked like from yesterday so

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,170
a fantastic wide-angle photograph from

00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,450
yesterday afternoon so when I say some

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,729
of this is obviously not all of the OSM

00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,680
community there and there's lots of

00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:01,130
people around the world who are not here

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,140
today and learning about our global

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,689
community and local communities is

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,959
actually very important in osm so you

00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:11,900
may be aware of a current survey that's

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,970
happening or it's just happened that is

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,610
asking some questions of the global and

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,760
local communities in OpenStreetMap and

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,890
they use soup and I think wrote a very

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,230
nice

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:27,370
summary of some of the responses that

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:30,850
the the survey gamed and I just picked

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:33,940
out visually some places where the word

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,920
community is emphasized that the

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,700
communities can vary from isolated

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,950
mappers who do not really necessarily

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,440
connect with other mappers to places

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,170
where it is fully organized mapping

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,690
presences there's also a scope where

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,150
people consider community varies from

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,490
cities to region from countries to

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,020
places but the crucial thing is that a

00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,660
community can do a lot more work

00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,890
together than it can apart so it means

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,080
that there should be an effort to

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,209
connect up and support communities but

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,160
that is a major challenge and what I'm

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,260
trying to look at today is to seeing how

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,650
connected or how similar different

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,030
communities are and just yesterday in

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,690
one of the Lightning talks but also

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:19,120
during the week on on the OSM channels

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,920
osm teams for example is an idea to try

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,340
and bring people together to work under

00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,410
an umbrella of a team as being a

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,350
community who will work on a problem

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:34,000
work on some some mapping area etc and

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:35,739
work as a as a mini community and for

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
those of you are not aware and sometimes

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,820
academics are not aware of the amount of

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,690
communication and amount of community

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,900
that's in osm so for example there are

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:50,410
many platforms channels and forums that

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,989
allow interaction on a community basis

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:56,110
so I've just screenshot at the example

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,720
for Germany from the website community -

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,580
OS m dot B and we can see here we've

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,730
mailing lists we have telegram we have

00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:06,190
Twitter we have different types of

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,410
mailing list we have IRC channels etc

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,640
etc so there's lots of different ways so

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,670
you can see trying to capture a

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,860
community is not just an easy situation

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,140
of finding a data set that represents

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:22,360
the community it's it's quite a wide and

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:27,010
varied problem so from the outside of

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,900
our sin what does osm look like and from

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,490
the outside if you're not really

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,280
familiar with the project you might take

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,550
the Noah same as a global massively

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,530
large crowd of map

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,690
who work continuously together to build

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,750
an open database of the world and these

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:45,230
mappers interact via forums mapping

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:48,910
parties etc but in reality from the

00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:51,950
inside or sam is a complex multi-layered

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,650
dispersed crowd of mappers it's

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:57,230
certainly a massive crowd there's a

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,000
large number of those that do a small

00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,280
number of those excuse me there's a

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,920
large amount of the work many people

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,320
work on their own and interaction does

00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,560
happen a pacific events and as we see

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,810
from some talks later mapping is caused

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,880
by certain events and mapping is

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,370
performed by different manners so

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,170
depending whether you're the inside or

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,290
outside the tent the view can be a

00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:24,110
little bit different now I'm sorry for

00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,090
this text heavy slide but an academic

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,130
research has looked at characteristics

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,880
of the mapper community for many many

00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:34,160
years and so the key results that that

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,290
keep trickling down through through

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,570
papers over the years is that a small

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,660
number of people do a large amount of

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,910
the work a very small proportion of

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,530
mappers or sorry very large keep

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,050
switching large and small today a large

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,850
proportion of mappers only perform a

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,370
small number of edits then possibly

00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,710
leave other things like some mappers

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,470
work on a global scale they edit things

00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,870
all over the world where others tend to

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:03,470
be very locally based and only work in

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:06,740
their own locality humanitarian issues

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:09,230
Drive mapping and has contributed hugely

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,230
to awesome over the last couple of years

00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:14,120
and if we look at OSF on a lifecycle

00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,970
type of basis we begin to see patterns

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,070
for example a difference between day

00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,670
versus night difference between weekends

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:26,060
and workdays Pacific event-driven

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:27,830
mapping so just a few slides to just

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,950
summarize the existing research into

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,320
community structure some research done

00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:36,680
here in Heidelberg for example the OSM

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:39,500
community has a vocal minority which

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,420
contributed over 95% of the data but a

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,000
silent majority so there's a

00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:47,950
contribution in equality here more

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,900
recently a paper looked at this

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,360
life cycle and I think this diagram

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,940
summer summarizes it quite nicely where

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,320
we find that people become visitors or

00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,410
explorers in OSM

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:04,120
they adopt and engage and then some

00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:07,240
people then detach or move away from the

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,950
project for one reason or another so if

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,930
you can get your hands in this paper a

00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:15,610
very very detailed analysis of the

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,970
community in or SEM in a lifecycle

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:21,850
manner something I did myself back six

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,730
years ago now was was applying graph

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,980
theoretic approaches to looking at our

00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,380
mapper is actually editing the work of

00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,840
other mappers and we tried to calculate

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:35,500
metrics like betweenness and centrality

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,260
etc to see what would happen when we

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,940
looked at places like Berlin which have

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,800
if we look at the numbers here this is

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,080
the ranking of the mappers who are doing

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,910
the most work and how much work are they

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,040
editing from other people in their

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:51,280
community so if we consider the city of

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,980
Berlin as being a community moving on

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,080
from that steel and others then looked

00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,040
at that work of ours and came up with

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,630
the idea of this idea of interlocking so

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,180
that mappers actually become interlocked

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,370
with each other and I edit your work you

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,500
edits person sees work and then person

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,900
see and it's me and we find that we have

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,530
a kind of an interlocking chain there

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,530
and that allowed a more quantitative

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,480
look at the depth that people will will

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,940
edit so edit each other and the breadth

00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,580
of how many they would edit each other

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,850
and then finally very recent work by

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:31,270
Guillaume Turia in in Paris and his

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:33,520
student again these are just anonymous

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:37,210
IDs but looking at multi-layered

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:41,890
networks and multiplex networks that try

00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:44,560
to see if editors or mappers act as

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,750
moderators in an online sense of their

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,610
other local community so what you might

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,280
find in some communities is that one

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,070
particular mapper is it the communities

00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,190
very contributor centric whereas in

00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:00,769
others no particular mapper is dominant

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:03,930
or is is moderating what is happening

00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:05,459
so essentially how are we looking at

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,519
community structure in our Sam I

00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:10,589
supposed to summarize the literature

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,779
very very briefly and not very very

00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:16,940
strongly there's a focus on quantity and

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:18,810
volume of contributions co-editing

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,910
distinguishing contributors from either

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,490
showing how different contributors are

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,680
and it's still difficult to compare one

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,290
map in community to another we still

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,930
haven't really decided on how we're

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,329
going to do that and mostly many papers

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,449
end up actually saying how complete a

00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:39,389
particular city is and drawing some

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:42,329
inferences that that's a reflection of

00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:46,410
the community so I had this idea a few

00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:48,389
years ago talking to a biology a friend

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,839
of mine who we go running at lunchtime

00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:54,240
and he talks about ecosystems and

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,970
communities and I'll explain this

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,949
diagram in a moment but we have at the

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,899
bottom of an ecological system and

00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:03,209
individual individuals live in

00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,850
populations the population then lives

00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:09,810
within a community who are part of a

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:13,260
larger ecosystem and I didn't steal this

00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:17,880
work from Jerry who I could be here he

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:21,060
is so Jerry very cleverly in a blog post

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,130
about 18 months ago likens

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,649
the way osm data is collected to how

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,750
species accumulate now I'm not an

00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:29,880
ecologist but I think if you can the

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,310
link is there and I'd have a read of

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,130
this but looking at how some species are

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:38,089
more easy to spot than others so appear

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:41,790
some move away and this is how data

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,470
happens to change in osm some things are

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,230
there one there some things are not

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:50,300
there the next but there's a couple of

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:52,709
seminal papers coming out of ecological

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,010
studies that look at diversity and

00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:58,610
similarity amongst ecosystems

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,500
particularly aquatic ecosystems

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:04,319
Washington is one of them and Hughes is

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,760
another and they have stood the test of

00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:09,350
time they're back in the mid eighties

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,670
and one of the quotes there is that

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,290
there is a way to look at community

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,310
structure based on two things on

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,220
diversity in the

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,899
and similarity in this is so one thing

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,360
we could do is combine the data on how

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,610
abundant a species into a single number

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,649
or we could look at how similar two

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:30,269
samples actually are so that leads us to

00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:35,220
the diagram we've seen a few minutes ago

00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:38,249
and if we apply this to or Sam the

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,980
individual mapper then is excuse me the

00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:44,639
individual a group of mappers then is

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:47,009
that population that group of mappers

00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,920
who might be a town or a community or a

00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:51,930
local group or an NGO etc build into a

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,300
community which might be global it might

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,730
be OS em at a country level and they fit

00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,699
into the ecosystem where OS m is sitting

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,100
amongst lots of other crowd-sourced

00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:04,170
initiatives etc so abundance then would

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,920
be defined as abundance of a particular

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:10,379
mapper types and then the similarity is

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,079
how similar to samples of mappers from

00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:16,350
different communities or ecosystems

00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:19,220
actually are so one of the most famous

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:25,949
ways of looking at communities is

00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:30,000
Pascal's idea of gold senior plus senior

00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:32,879
etc which was published around 2012 with

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,889
edits but we it's now probably better to

00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,139
look at change sets as a way of grouping

00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:40,290
together work so we just look at at

00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:42,029
Heidelberg I extracted the history data

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,889
for Heidelberg using that relation there

00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:48,000
on the top left so we see there's

00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:51,000
there's one person responsible for 2000

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,129
plus change sets which is an incredible

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,699
amount of work in in Heidelberg there's

00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:59,610
eight senior 63 sorry it's in your plus

00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:03,029
and sixty-three etc so we have a lot of

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:05,370
cases where we have the dominant species

00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:08,429
here is the newly registered so the

00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,860
person who just commits one change set

00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:13,679
there may only be one edit in there but

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,470
it's a single change set so just for a

00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:20,069
bit of variety and a small file size

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:24,499
just looked at Luxembourg then so a

00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:28,519
contra sized community six goals then

00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:31,009
and again we see that the lower number

00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:31,819
of change sets are the dominant species

00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:36,169
there

00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:39,679
and finally Nottingham is a place I like

00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:42,439
doing analysis on because it's very much

00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,899
a community driven

00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:46,219
I haven't taken in most of the

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:47,929
university area again I've just

00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:50,479
extracted from the relation for

00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:53,719
Nottingham city but we're seeing a

00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:56,349
similar pattern so so is it easy to

00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:58,789
compare those numbers and say that

00:13:56,349 --> 00:14:00,619
Nottingham is the same as Heidelberg or

00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:03,739
there's a difference between the two

00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:05,539
well it's not so easy so if we look at

00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:08,059
the papers I showed you a few minutes

00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:12,559
ago some of the most famous indicators

00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:14,419
and indices and don't worry these aren't

00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,509
actually that difficult they're just

00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:19,399
really summations of different values

00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:22,549
there's say one of the famous ones is

00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,679
called Simpsons D with maglevs D then

00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:25,879
for diversity

00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,489
Shannon's index is the one you'll know

00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:30,259
from information theory if you have a

00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:32,389
computer science background you'll have

00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:35,269
heard of it Herbert's PI and then

00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:38,419
McIntosh it's ecological distance now

00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:40,519
it's a bit too much to read them all but

00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:43,189
essentially they all are on a reasonably

00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,599
simple scale for example Simpson is that

00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:47,509
if you get a score of zero the

00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:49,339
populations infinitely diverse and a

00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:50,809
score of 1 means there's no diversity so

00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:53,329
that means the species are all exactly

00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:56,089
the same the individuals are all exactly

00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:59,089
the same there and Shannon's index then

00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:00,889
has a maximum of the log of the number

00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:04,189
of species so we can at least see

00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:07,039
whether the level is an interesting one

00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:09,049
it's herbert's pi is that if you are an

00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,279
individual in the community basically

00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:12,709
what are the chances of your in

00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:16,189
interacting when every other individual

00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:19,039
in the community so obviously bigger

00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:20,779
communities it may not be as possible so

00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,389
some backgrounds and assumptions before

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,849
I show you the results and we use the

00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:28,159
OSM history from geo fabric who I'm

00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:30,859
always indebted to for making history

00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:33,949
extraction easy for me and we just look

00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:34,810
at the OSM user IDs we don't import the

00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:37,540
user

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:39,160
so I can't point out Pacific people at

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,350
the moment I just considered the editing

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,360
and creation of nodes where's relations

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,040
and tides I haven't looked at if people

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,380
are doing stuff with geometry so I'll

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,670
move on to that hopefully and we assume

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,329
that all Sam communities in different

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:55,630
regions would share similar community

00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:58,959
characteristics now I'm sorry I'm really

00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:02,769
bad at drawing nice visualizations so

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,180
I'm good at at these type of tables just

00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:06,370
want to draw something out that there's

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:10,000
not a really very clear picture here of

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:12,300
how similar any of these these

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,430
communities are this is the number of

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,110
contributors in distinct contributors

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,560
this is the number of groups from

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:23,529
pascal's groupings so we can see that

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,959
there's reasonable diversity within

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:29,139
within all of them if we look at Shannon

00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:31,750
for example the maximum meaning that all

00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:33,699
species would be equally common is a

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,410
little bit given that it's a log scale

00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:37,329
it's a little bit away from what we

00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,220
would would say that all this all

00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,170
spaceships are like each other because

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,300
we know they're not most of the groups

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:46,180
they are contributing a small number of

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,040
change sets and then that Macintosh for

00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,800
example that all individuals are

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,660
different if it's one that's I take a

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,630
good score there is showing that there

00:16:52,660 --> 00:17:00,670
are differences between the individuals

00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:03,220
if if we if we actually create some

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:06,520
quantiles on this so just split them up

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:09,660
reasonably roughly into a 12 quantile so

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,929
11 species groups we see these numbers

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:18,730
changing again I supposed to want to

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:20,799
know really is that they this has caused

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,689
a little bit of a problem saying that

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,880
there's less diversity then when we have

00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:26,470
this number of groups because the team

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,360
quote by just splitting it up into

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,080
quantized in sorted order it's probably

00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:34,299
not the cleverest

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:37,929
way to do it there the last result is

00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:40,570
something that I really really enjoy is

00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:43,240
looking at specific mapping activities

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,250
so I just think there's something

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,230
wonderful about mapping postboxes and

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,800
benches because most people walk by them

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,200
and never

00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:55,690
about them in nottingham city there's

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,970
790 of those 52 mappers involved and

00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,120
possibly one high-volume mapper over

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:05,530
there who has edited or done something

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:08,410
wish at least on 426 occasions

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:10,960
heidelberg again scales up this number

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,520
of post boxes and benches and Luxembourg

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,140
so what I'm saying here is now let's

00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,080
forget everything else and let's just

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:21,460
assume that the only thing there is post

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:23,500
boxes and benches and now we find that

00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,170
the individuals million species are

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,120
starting to become reasonably similar so

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,860
I have no nice visualization here to

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,410
point this out but if you look at these

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:35,220
numbers hard enough when the

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:38,530
presentation is online it's a little bit

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,150
clearer so what I'm hoping to do is to

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,160
expand this a little bit and be more

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,410
rigorous in how I pick out the groups

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,160
but I was happy to see that smaller

00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:51,010
Pacific community groups then become

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,250
more common if we look at something very

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,170
pacific so future work because this is

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,030
really only starting I want to do some

00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,530
more rigorous comparison of communities

00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,870
from different areas of just picked out

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,220
tree at the moment to try and think

00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:06,130
about different ways to create the

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,160
groups analyze maybe over different

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,660
regions over timescales

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,280
I'd be very interested in looking at

00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,440
species develop using a qualitative

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,870
approach so ask people how they map and

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,810
then try and reflect that in the groups

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,640
that we create a if I was mathematically

00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,470
brave enough I would look at something

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:28,540
more complex like the hill numbers which

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:32,290
are a more complex framework for species

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:35,710
abundance but I need to improve my

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:37,390
probability analysis a bit eventually

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,790
this is going onto github it's a very

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:44,140
simple workflow awesome convert just

00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:46,900
takes the Geo fabric data files PI ozium

00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:50,490
I'm indebted to and in this was in two

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:54,880
postures so it's a very simple flow of

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,860
data just a free plug before I go way I

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,160
am on a different scale we have a

00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,059
workshop in Zurich next month on legal

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,769
ethical and

00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:04,570
privacy factors in crowd source

00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:06,190
information it's free registration I

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,830
know that doesn't mean a lot in Zurich

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:12,909
when it's quite expensive to go there

00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:15,490
but we're still have registration opens

00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:17,559
it's still available just Google for

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,950
less than twenty twenty nineteen and

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,740
you'll find us and just a tank the

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,539
academic from the academic training tank

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,370
tank the organizers for facilitating

00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:29,200
this and of course OpenStreetMap for

00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,919
being the inspiration for this research

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,919
thank you

00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:48,240
so I think we can take a question or two

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:49,559
before coffee Patricia so it's so

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,350
fascinating I think there's so many

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:53,669
applications for I you know how you can

00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,130
understand the different communities and

00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,840
how they interact I'm sensitive to the

00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,669
problem that you're finding in how you

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,230
define those communities in your future

00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:03,150
research have you thought about how you

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:08,039
would address the modifiable arrow unit

00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:08,340
problem and like gerrymandering yes do

00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,860
that

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,080
every every minute I do this I think

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:16,620
about this and I will warn my student

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,390
stand about about that Pacific and this

00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,559
is where I think maybe something like

00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:24,090
the postbox benches might able to not

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,610
really resolve it but looking at

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:28,500
something Pacific that we could cordon

00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,570
off maybe even something from an

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,020
ecological point of view so if we if we

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,250
look at a certain species of plant and

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,750
we know it doesn't grow somewhere else

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,539
well then at least we have we have

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,909
bounded the area but yeah that's what

00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:45,240
I'm juggling with to try and find I do

00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:48,390
feel uncomfortable about using a city as

00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,799
a community then I feel equally

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,270
uncomfortable about drilling down too

00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,039
far because I know that if you just go

00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,950
down to a block level or an admin level

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,429
that doesn't work either so it's trying

00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:01,470
to come up with with the right region is

00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:05,280
something that I've struggled with so

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:10,799
I'd be happy to hear suggestions on how

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:13,710
we could do that Jerry Jerry Clough SK

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,080
55 I just like to follow on directly

00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,429
from that because there's a specific

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,360
problem about using the Nottingham

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:23,520
bounding box as representing the city

00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:27,000
for very long and complicated historical

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,830
reasons the region the administrative

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,380
area is much smaller than the actual

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,240
practical area of the city and actually

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,730
two of the gold star map has happened to

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,360
live just within half a kilometre

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:41,840
outside and it's probably not an

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,909
accurate reflection of our actual

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,040
community and but but that's a very

00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:48,659
specific problem with Nottingham yeah if

00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,789
you look at my shop data you can

00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:53,460
see that that there where I took all

00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:57,119
European cities over 200,000 and look

00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,739
but yes history of mapping of shops yeah

00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,159
and then of course the university is

00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:04,470
outside of that polygon that I've showed

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,940
there as well is it the universities in

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:10,859
there but this enormous student

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:14,489
community just don't so yes yes question

00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:17,720
up the very back there will go for the

00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:17,720
gentleman at the back

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:35,760
okay yeah um - two remarks one things

00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:39,090
about species I personally think it's

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,760
not well a good term for Metroid because

00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:43,560
we're we are people and kind of well

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,710
basically you could go over senior

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,990
mapper or a gold standard mapper just

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,520
buy time right people might be in for

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,280
just two short heaven where there's no

00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,340
no chance do you already become become

00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,380
senior so I think rather something well

00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,420
that's just live a phrasing but I also

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,880
think it has to do with analysis why do

00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,620
I think it would be fine to control for

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,110
the time since somebody's is

00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,790
contributing when you could go for the

00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:11,190
edits over time or something like that

00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:14,280
and then when the different level also

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:17,970
comparing communities comparing cities I

00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,470
think you also need to control for basic

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,450
for confounding factors between the

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:25,230
different cities kind of haven't mapped

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:27,300
in an equal amount right otherwise you

00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,730
might compare them differently so people

00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,430
go for the map things first when

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,780
postboxes might be a variant if other

00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,640
things are already mapped so if you

00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,530
start a mapping everything else's map

00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,710
you go for post boxes so therefore this

00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:43,980
comparison I think he would need to to

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,720
consider also the factor of a cities

00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,810
kind of how how they differ do not

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,550
compare apples and oranges that's a

00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,050
great point and something I mentioned in

00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,750
the future work was to look at this

00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:57,330
other time scale and I because that

00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,100
would help filter out problems that if a

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,980
senior or a gold mapper did leave the

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,530
area five years ago that they are not

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,450
part of the analysis now but yeah I'm

00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:08,610
aware of the phrasing the the species

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:13,800
saying I think we just need to look for

00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:16,140
the right words there and but but I get

00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:20,040
your I absolutely agree then with with

00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:22,800
those definition issues about about the

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,850
region size and certainly about the

00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:29,010
timescales that may be to look at

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:32,040
mapping parties or Pacific events that

00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,630
would cause additional mapping and then

00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,690
I should said then the type of objects

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:39,300
as well what has been mapped and what's

00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,830
there before during and after the events

00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,060
that were looking at so thank you for

00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,430
that

00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,720
okay I'll have to take this lady here

00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:50,460
was first and then you're in the last

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,460
yeah and then we would stop for coffee

00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,830
hi very interesting I'm curious if

00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,260
you've looked at our thought of looking

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:04,080
at the communities and whether they're

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,690
mapping locally or if they're mapping

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,020
remote locations and if there's some

00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:13,450
something some similarities in those two

00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:16,390
groups what they do yeah so at the

00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:20,080
moment we are just as I said we're we

00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:22,840
just look at what is edited and created

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,520
within that bounding polygon essentially

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,120
but that would be an extension then to

00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:30,520
see that if you are editing within there

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,890
are you editing other places and and to

00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,990
control or factor that in so that would

00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:40,480
be an extended part of the analysis yes

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:42,520
thank you for your doctor thank you this

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,860
is a bit tangential but related do you

00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,600
had a people in 2015 about observing an

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,130
osm mapping part is kind of an

00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,500
ethnography so what are your latest

00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:53,980
thoughts about that kind of method to

00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,080
approach this you had a bit of an

00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:59,140
ethnographic work of a mapping party in

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,850
2015 and in a paper in 2050 yes so what

00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,100
I really place thoughts about that that

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,720
kind of path in studying the structure

00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,130
of a community kind of an ethnographic

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,990
yeah so the question is about looking at

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,400
mapping parties and structures so the

00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,530
mapping parties have been involved in

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:20,710
have have all been a learning process

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:23,470
because we add a mapping party you

00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:27,220
realize the value of experienced mappers

00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:30,580
within your local community because it's

00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,950
in a mapping party let's call them a

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,800
gold or a senior senior mappers can

00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:38,230
really help inspire the new people that

00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,420
are entering the community but also give

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,800
you that local information that that

00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,350
will explain some things that people

00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:47,130
might might find confusing maybe about

00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:49,750
boundary information about particular

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:53,260
local and local information that may be

00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:55,149
confusing to a person not not there so I

00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,580
haven't done any work recently on

00:27:55,149 --> 00:28:00,639
and party have been involved in some but

00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:03,129
again the the crucial take-home question

00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:05,679
is that if you are doing a mapping party

00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:07,839
it's it's in your best interest to have

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,940
some experienced people there who can

00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,369
because they can help with all parts of

00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,929
the process and actually the rising tide

00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:17,349
carries everybody there and so that

00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:19,299
actually inspires the new people to to

00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:20,889
work together but it needs to be goal

00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:22,839
driven the mapping party some of the

00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:26,200
papers have read recently if there's not

00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:27,849
a a more long term goal it's a short

00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,619
term goal some people can lose interest

00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:34,929
and just never appear again in OSM okay

00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:36,940
so I will thank you for the response to

00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:38,409
my talk I will take you also for

00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,690
response to all of the talks in this

00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:42,999
session it's been a great start to the

00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:46,419
academic track today so we'll have more

00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:48,599
at 11:30 so thanks again and see you

00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:48,599
later

00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,520
