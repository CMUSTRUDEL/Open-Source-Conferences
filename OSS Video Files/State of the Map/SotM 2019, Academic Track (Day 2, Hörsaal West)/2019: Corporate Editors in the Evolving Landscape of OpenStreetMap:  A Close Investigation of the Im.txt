Description: 
	More than 17 million edits globally have been made by paid contributors in the last five years. We look at the long history of corporate involvement in OSM and then dig into the data to quantify the impact this latest evolution of corporate involvement is having on the map and explore the interactions between paid and volunteer mappers.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is both a map and the active community of over a million mappers that create and maintain it. Participation in OSM has largely been studied in terms of motivation and the resulting data quality. Today, the community is comprised by many different interest groups including craft/hobby mappers, humanitarian mappers, professional mappers, and more. The last few years have seen a dramatic growth in a specific group of mappers: corporate editors. These are mappers hired by corporations and edit the map as part of their employment. In November 2018, the OSM Foundation published the _organized editing guidelines_ that outline a number of steps all groups engaged in organized editing activities (including corporate data teams), should take to promote transparency, openness, and engagement with other mappers—especially local community. This work identifies ten corporations that are complying with these guidelines and explores their mapping activities. We found these corporations have cumulatively edited over 17M objects globally in the last five years, of which 9M were edited in 2018 [1].

First, we traced the  history of corporate involvement in OSM to show that while this growing phenomena of corporate editing is new, it represents just the latest stage in a long history of corporations both contributing to and benefitting from OpenStreetMap. Next, we used historical quarterly-snapshot OSM-QA-Tiles to quantify where the ten corporations are active on the map and what types of edits they are performing. We find these edits are global in geographical scope, yet vary per corporation in location and edit type: Corporations heavily impact road networks, yet non-corporate mappers maintain the majority of all edits by mapping more buildings and points-of-interest [1]. To date, this research has quantified and contextualized the growing phenomena of corporate editing in OSM and identified the need for more in-depth analysis to more descriptively explain the impact to the map and volunteer mappers in these regions where corporate-editors are active. 

To further explore these impacts, we need to dig deeper into the editing record to describe the evolution of the map. For this, we are building upon open-source OSM data-processing tools to construct new vector tiles with with full OSM editing histories [4]. These new historical analysis tiles allow us to efficiently explore the evolution of the map in these regions. This allows us to better contextualize and visualize the interactions between corporate editors and volunteer mappers at scale. Previous research has shown that the road network typically gets mapped first and the map builds up from there [2]. To this extent, we will explore the notion of _map seeding_ whereby paid editors create the first version of the road network, seeding the map for others to maintain and grow. Supporting such an idea is the concept of _densification_ of the map, where some mappers prefer to edit where there is existing—though incomplete or sparse—map data, instead of a beginning with a blank section of map [3]. The concept of such editing patterns highlights the nuances in effectively measuring the impact of paid editing on the map. In other words, this question is more complicated than “are corporate editors taking over?”

The first part of the research presented here was recently published [1]. The deeper exploration of the data to identify and explain the impact to the map and local communities is current, ongoing research. At State of the Map, I will briefly summarize the completed work to better set the context, and then present the results of our ongoing investigation on the impact to the map and community.

okay so the next presentation is from

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,310
Janet's is

00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,619
you can see out it's not there okay not

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,300
the full title but so it's about you

00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:26,119
could see that also in your note in the

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,210
book booklet is about corporate editors

00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,270
in the evolving landscape of osm a close

00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:38,379
investigation of the impact to the map

00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:41,180
and community so please Janice okay

00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:42,170
alright thank you all for coming today

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,030
I'm gonna share with you some of my

00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,660
latest research involving corporate

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,370
editing and OpenStreetMap so what is

00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,860
corporate editing I'm specifically

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,930
talking about data teams these are teams

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,260
of employees that edit the map as part

00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,610
of their paid profession broadly

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,590
speaking this is a form of what the

00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,840
community is calling organized editing

00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,430
this is an all-encompassing label to

00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,840
describe groups of contributors who are

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,950
editing with a common goal or purpose

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,990
what's new about corporate editing is

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,320
the editing itself this is not the first

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,610
form of corporate involvement in OSM

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,229
rather this is a new stage in the

00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:22,310
evolution of the relationship between

00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:24,200
corporations and osm and ultimately

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,850
incorporating can be a contentious topic

00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,649
in the community some people are very

00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,630
suspicious of corporate intent and data

00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:31,280
use the mailing list can get quite

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:35,330
heated when it comes to discussions

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,069
involving corporations so my research

00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,840
all started with this map I made this

00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:41,450
last October showing where data teams

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,220
were editing and the quantity and global

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:47,869
scale these edits prompted this new line

00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,910
of research so this led to this paper

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,039
this past spring that I wrote with my

00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,300
co-authors deep does her car who was at

00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:55,610
the National University of Singapore at

00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,319
the time and Laci Palin at the

00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,789
University of Colorado Boulder the

00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,619
papers titled corporate editors in the

00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:02,479
evolving landscape of OpenStreetMap and

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,880
as published last May in the Journal of

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,160
geo information this papers set the

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,239
groundwork for my current research

00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,860
therefore I will present the methods and

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,530
results from this paper to set the stage

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,760
for my current research agenda it's open

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,890
access so if you'd like to read it in

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,280
full just search for the title and paper

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,140
should come up so what we set out to do

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,120
is quantify and explore these activities

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,219
as objectively as possible from the

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,469
beginning we read up on years of history

00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,760
in the wiki mailing list and blogs to

00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:30,290
get a better idea of the his

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,090
of corporate involvement and then looked

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,560
into the database itself to quantify the

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,870
activity we found no ascent has a long

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,599
and complex history especially involving

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,400
corporations without years of some

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,780
amount of corporate involvement I think

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,670
our son would look very different today

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,560
certainly less complete from many parts

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,360
of the world and it's for these reasons

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,159
that we consider corporate editing just

00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,049
this latest stage in the evolution of

00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,819
corporate involvement not the beginning

00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,230
of corporate involvement I just think

00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:01,790
this is a really important contextual

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,989
detail so last November the Foundation

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,450
released the organized editing

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,950
guidelines and one requirement in these

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,720
guidelines is that organized editing

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,409
teams maintain a list of user names

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,299
associated with their activities this

00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:16,159
time last year each of these ten

00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:18,379
companies or maintaining lists of user

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,310
names for their data teams so these

00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:27,379
became the ten companies of our study so

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,730
here's an example list and you can see

00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:31,040
this page is well monitored and updated

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,780
this list has been edited over over 100

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,760
times to keep the data team usernames

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,620
current to quantify the activity we use

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,169
quarterly historical osmq a tile

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,730
snapshots these are vector tiles for the

00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:46,160
entire planet that include a snapshot of

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,919
the map as it existed at the end of each

00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,599
quarter since 2006 for example here's a

00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,870
comparison of the snapshots from London

00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,609
in 2007 to London today quarterly

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,440
snapshots provide a computationally

00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:58,970
efficient way to include the history of

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,400
the map when analyzing at the global

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,379
scale for example if a corporate editor

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,049
added an object to the map in January

00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:08,120
2018 which was subsequently edited later

00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:10,040
in the year by an encore / editor we're

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,459
still able to capture that initial

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,530
corporate edit osm create tiles are

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:19,430
optimized for tile based analysis with

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,039
tools such as tile reduce so for each

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,139
quarter we run this job over the planet

00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,849
we break the planet up into zoom level

00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:29,780
12 tiles containing all the object

00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:31,220
metadata then we simply count the number

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,780
of corporate edits on each tile by

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,539
comparing the user names against the

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,940
curated list of data team members which

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,800
I'll reduce in a decent-size machine we

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,340
can aggregate and sum all these edits

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,740
for the current

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,810
planet in about ten minutes we do this

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,330
for every quarter since 2006 which means

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,180
running the same job 48 times against

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:55,190
each of the different tile sets and this

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:56,810
is what we find here we see where these

00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:01,820
10 corporations have been contributing

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:04,130
to the map since 2014 we can break it

00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,380
out by company you can see that TeleNav

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:09,169
is pretty North American focused cart

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,690
Apple map box dev seed have global

00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,639
coverage grab is focused in Southeast

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,130
Asia and Facebook in Thailand

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,419
these shouldn't surprise us Microsoft

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,790
and uber have major presence in

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,100
Australia and New Zealand and Amazon

00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:27,430
logistics is primarily in the u.s. in

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:29,990
the UK and here it is by the numbers

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,030
ultimately at the end of 2018 there are

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,789
nearly 17 million edits from almost

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,080
1,000 corporate editors you can find

00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:40,340
this table in the paper if you'd like to

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,340
explore it in more depth if we break it

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,020
down by edit type we find this most

00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,550
notable is this increase in total

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,840
activity in 2018 from the previous years

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:55,610
specifically corporate teams are editing

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,050
roads and adding new buildings next we

00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,729
looked at what types of objects data

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,289
teams are editing in relation to non

00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,320
corporate editors in the areas where

00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:04,910
teams are active so that is the percent

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,610
of the total number of edits that were

00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:10,160
performed by a data team on those tiles

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:15,229
where a team was active and then this is

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,639
per year globally averaged by company so

00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:18,110
most companies have a growing interest

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,490
in editing roads in the areas where

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,200
they're active becoming more and more

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,460
responsible for the total percentages of

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,930
roads being edited resumed in here on

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,389
two examples we can interpret these a

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,280
little bit further so first we notice

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:35,210
that TeleNav primarily focuses on roads

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,099
this makes sense in 2015 TeleNav was

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,470
responsible for a little over 25 percent

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:41,270
of the total edits on average in areas

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,740
where they were active in the years

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,550
since that number has climbed to just

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:49,460
over 50% on the right we see that in

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,960
2016 cart was responsible for over 50%

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,360
of all the edits in the area

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,430
where they were active not just roads

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,120
but this included amenities and POS and

00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:03,410
then in 2017 2018 that editing focus has

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,970
shifted to the road network Microsoft

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,440
shows a consistently growing trend in

00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,870
the amount of Road features that are

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,680
editing growing from none - about 75

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,930
percent in 2015 to 2018 and companies

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,370
like grabbed new to the scene are having

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,740
a major impact on the road networks

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,270
responsible for nearly 75% of all the

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,620
road edits in the areas where they're

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:26,990
active on average and so this is the

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,940
complement to the previous figures so

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,490
this says for areas where corporate

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,680
teams are active on average the non

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,380
corporate editors are now responsible

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,870
for less than 25% of the total road

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:42,650
editing activity which is down from

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,360
closer to 70% in 2017 so this implies

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,430
then where data teams are active on

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,580
average they're now responsible for more

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,199
than 70% of the road editing non

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,120
corporate editors however are still

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,030
responsible for the majority of all

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,659
edits about 70% especially edits to

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,220
buildings Pio eyes amenities

00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,720
I think this trend is definitely

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:09,139
continuing I don't have the numbers yet

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:11,990
for 2019 if we look at the number of

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:14,599
edits from the single team each day we

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,330
see this fun pattern emerge here you're

00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:19,550
looking at a five-day workweek each of

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,050
these groups represents five days of

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,570
editing activity punctuated by two days

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,840
off this is confirmed by seeing 52 of

00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,740
these recurring patterns in a given year

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,449
initially I thought this was a telltale

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,740
sign of kind of paid corporate editing

00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:33,650
where editors are only active on

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,229
weekdays when they're at work however we

00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,990
do actually see this or similar patterns

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:40,880
among thousands of other mappers most

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,500
active contributors do have some pattern

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,579
to their editing people aren't just

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,779
randomly editing osm so initially I

00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:50,089
thought this could be a towel that would

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,770
identify the undisclosed teams but

00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:55,610
that's not possible from the temporal

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:57,529
signature alone so let's take a step

00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,120
back well we were able to quantify how

00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:00,800
much corporate editing is happening and

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,700
where I really haven't answered any

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,130
questions about the impact on the map

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,960
other than the sheer numbers the impact

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,150
is not what was measured we need to dig

00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,590
deeper into the full history and context

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,680
of the map to explore these types of

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,840
questions so here are three specific

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,510
interactions that I think we may find if

00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,580
we do this I want to investigate this

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,820
idea of map seeding

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,130
I'm calling this an extension of what's

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,530
been coined as map gardening discussed

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,750
another work in this case paid editors

00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,690
are making might be making some of the

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,340
first edits in an area kind of seeding

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,710
the map and then others are filling in

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:42,600
and maintaining the map after it's kind

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:44,550
of been jump-started or seeded this the

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,320
last mile where corporate editors are

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,630
coming through and connecting the gaps

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,980
fixing holes bringing the map really

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,980
over the thresholds in terms of

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,650
completeness and then third just

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,120
consistent continuous validation Quality

00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,180
Assurance work I think that these are

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,380
all patterns that I expect to find by

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,940
digging into the map a little bit

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,470
further so how to do this we need the

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,390
complete editing history of the map to

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,180
see exactly when objects were edited and

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,760
by whom we need to know which user names

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,470
I associated with data teams these lists

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,260
are constantly growing and changing and

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,630
maintaining them in a machine-readable

00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:24,030
manner is very time-consuming so this is

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,060
another area for improvement and kind of

00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:29,130
cooperation among everyone and then we

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,470
need to as always build new tools that

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:37,020
can help us search these data for these

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:39,330
patterns so let's dive in here grab and

00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,050
Singapore this shows the interaction

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:45,470
between grab the green and red dots and

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,000
Nan grab editors the pink lines you see

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,470
by the way each of those red dots is a

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,760
restriction unless they turn

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:55,860
restrictions here what we see here is

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,390
that grab is very active in Singapore

00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,370
doing more than is filling in the map

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,790
but also extensively editing existing

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,500
features if we look at the temporal

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,050
profile of this activity we find that

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,240
grab is consistently active in Singapore

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,400
this type of editing has been described

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,410
as maintenance editing or map gardening

00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,749
where these editors are consistently

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,040
engaged with the map in the

00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:19,949
there's also a few these non-corporate

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:24,239
spikes in 2017 and I'm curious about if

00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:27,480
anyone has more ideas on that next

00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:29,040
Thailand this is a heat map of edits

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,089
from the Facebook team in Thailand since

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,589
mid 2017 this is very similar to the the

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,379
video summary that Facebook and I tio

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:38,819
world produced which makes me happy

00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:40,230
because that means that my data looks

00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:42,480
how it should

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,429
I think what's particularly fun about

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,249
this is to see how organized this effort

00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:51,329
is clearly mapping with the tasking

00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:52,589
manager in this coordinated fashion so

00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:53,759
if we're going closer we see a different

00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:55,470
type of interaction than we saw in

00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,069
Singapore different company different

00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,899
data use different geography Facebook

00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:02,549
edits are here in green non Facebook

00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,249
edits in pink there's a clear division

00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:07,319
of labor here between the left and right

00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:09,239
Facebook editors are here by filling in

00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:11,100
the map between the existing mapped

00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:13,610
areas when if you've seen the work with

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,610
the rapid eye

00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,579
very similar here Facebook is working to

00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,839
expand outwards from this previously map

00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:28,410
City and here's the temporal profile for

00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,939
all the edits in eastern Thailand first

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,399
notice that basically all of the editing

00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:34,529
in late 2017 and much jazzing 18 was

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,739
from Facebook but then we see these blue

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:38,549
spikes especially in later 2018

00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:40,110
investigating these edits directly

00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:43,079
suggest that they're part of a major

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,489
building mapping effort which if this is

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,589
happening after the road network is

00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:48,329
filled in then there's is this case to

00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:50,639
be made for this concept of map seeding

00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:51,779
or Facebook added the roads and other

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:59,069
people are coming in and doing the

00:12:51,779 --> 00:13:00,660
buildings cart editing in Jamaica here's

00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:06,929
the overall we see a lot of green and

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:08,790
pink and tangled together and then if we

00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:11,040
go earlier we see a lot of non corporate

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,949
editing activity in Kingston since 2015

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,749
as we begin to see green come in it's

00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:20,939
kind of all over and then towards the

00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:22,860
end we see much more coverage and here's

00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:24,299
that temporal profile there was a decent

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,189
amount of mapping activity over the

00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:26,640
years and then cart was consistently

00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:29,040
active

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,080
2018 editing small pieces here and there

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,210
with one big massive editing of the road

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,800
network towards the end again this is

00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,940
probably classified as map gardening or

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,250
maintenance mapping as there

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,050
sporadically active doing small edits

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,120
over time and then come in with one

00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:45,660
larger push at the end perhaps an effort

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:50,490
of completion or validation this is

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:52,680
Apple in Nigeria non-corporate editors

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,020
have a major footprint and then Apple

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,340
comes in its kind of smaller chunks at

00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,420
first followed by small maintenance

00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:03,320
editing while the rest of the community

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,320
continues to map

00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,960
so this is perhaps another case of

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:22,440
maintenance and validation in general

00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:26,370
and we also do see a little bit of

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,080
corporate editing early on only 2014

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:32,640
which that would have been the nap box

00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:35,340
data team at that time this is an

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,680
animation of Amazon logistics in Dallas

00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,590
Texas we see a lot of smaller edits over

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,380
time this is how Amazon looks in many US

00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,510
cities this appears to be a form of kind

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,210
of massive validation and quality

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,820
improvement / fixing as Amazon is

00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:53,250
incorporating feedback from their

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,980
delivery network this team's activity

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:59,910
has been growing recently as the as the

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,320
graph in the top there really shows so I

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,300
think this is how a lot of people feel

00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,580
about corporate editing big question

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,160
mark here and also it's this kind of us

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,450
versus them mentality and unsure what

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,630
this interaction could look like

00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:15,420
I think perhaps a more accurate

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,770
depiction of the complexity of the

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,380
larger Yoast community would be

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,150
something like this right many different

00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,340
groups each coming with their own

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:27,810
mapping motivations and dependent value

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,100
systems data use goals further I hate

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,870
breaking it down like this because

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,760
membership with any of these subgroups

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,500
is really not exclusive Nappers are

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,230
consistently moving between these groups

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,700
so anyways I just think this is one

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,230
large representation of the OSM

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,410
community that helps put all these

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,640
questions about editing interactions

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,590
into perhaps a different a different

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,640
context which is really important

00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:54,510
because we're growing at an incredible

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:56,340
rate number of active users each day is

00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,530
increasing at a rate higher than the

00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,000
number of edits each day so we have a

00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,410
different kind of editing signature

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,290
among the entire community we have more

00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,790
editors doing less individual work but

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:10,890
we have more community as more people

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:12,540
involved I just want to put this up

00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:14,880
there to kind of give a little state of

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,220
the state of the map density chart here

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,010
this is looking at object density

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:23,450
essentially the number of nap objects

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:27,120
counted on each zoom level 12 map tile

00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,730
at first glance we say look there is not

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,189
object

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,049
everywhere but in reality this is kind

00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,889
of a diverging color scheme here from

00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:39,119
purple to yellow with this log scale

00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:42,519
where where the map is yellow and green

00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:46,209
is fairly complete if you want to use

00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:49,179
that metric however where the map is

00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:53,619
kind of purple in blue we have like zero

00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:56,169
to 100 objects per zoom level 12 tile

00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:58,480
about the area of a small city so this

00:16:56,169 --> 00:17:01,660
is telling us it's a lot like Pascal

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,609
nice is the map of unmapped places where

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,389
we're seeing that we know something is

00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:11,069
there but we have like 10 objects for a

00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:16,779
gigantic area so it's not mapped yet so

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:18,309
there's still a lot to map okay so this

00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:20,139
is ongoing research that started with

00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:22,689
the identification and quantification of

00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:24,699
corporate editing in osm and leads us to

00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:26,230
a complicated landscape for corporate

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,440
editing is having a major impact on the

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,610
map in many different ways these impacts

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,049
need to be investigated at the

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,580
individual edit level to see the

00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:35,500
interaction with the editors around them

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,570
and blanket statements about corporate

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,980
editing in one place does not always

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,860
apply to editing patterns and other

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,809
places so if you'd like to read the

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,370
paper and fold that introduce this it's

00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:49,000
open access and you can find it at that

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:51,850
address and thank you very much and

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,360
thank you to my co-authors deep toaster

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:58,330
car and Leisha Palin as well as Mikkel

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,830
Zhu ball and Jean all who helped me put

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,120
all the data teams together and do this

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,120
work so thank you

00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,310
thank you very much Jenny I think this

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,660
exciting thank you for the presentation

00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:22,310
we have more time for questions so if

00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,380
you have any question we have one mark

00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,670
there the other mark is here you can

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:32,840
just raise your hand and then we'll come

00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:34,490
back we'll come to you with Mike first

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,190
of all thank you for an amazing

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:41,420
presentation so Nicola from Microsoft so

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:44,570
just to be clear yes we're doing a lot

00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:47,810
of Road editing and primarily very

00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:50,000
complex road properties such as turn

00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:52,700
restrictions polyvalent turn

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,590
restrictions destination signs in

00:18:52,700 --> 00:19:00,980
Australia and I'm thinking how is it

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:03,380
that we can get the community to to

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,840
inspire them and to teach them how to do

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,870
these complex editing tasks because in

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:13,460
Australia we saw that people simply

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:15,740
created very complex road junctions but

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:20,360
never bothered to put the destinations

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,890
on them we wish we can first of all

00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,400
we're very proud of the work we're doing

00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:28,220
in Australia we even though we're based

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,560
in Serbia and us we're proud of doing

00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,770
the work in Australia but how do we

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,060
teach the community to do this

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,800
that's a great question I'm I'm probably

00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,480
not the best person to to answer that

00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,790
but I think just saying that in this

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,150
room is probably the best way to start

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:46,370
the conversation around that that's

00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,890
that's fantastic that you guys are doing

00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,320
that work I think and I think these are

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,450
some of the nuance patterns that we can

00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,250
start to tease out in the data to

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,070
identify where as is happening over this

00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,270
needs to be happening and start to kind

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,670
of use these tools use these

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:04,070
identifications to further drive that

00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:06,500
conversation and hopefully just be

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:11,500
getting more people involved a little

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,500
bit a cop-out answer but yeah

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:20,110
if I remember correctly the corporate

00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,390
edits often had a lot of new features

00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,940
and they also was especially divided

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:29,230
between the the rest of the community

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:31,690
and corporate members so I assume there

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,850
also wasn't any FL effect that the new

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,420
features that the corporate members

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:39,850
state map was continued and enriched in

00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,980
detail by the rest of the community so

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,980
they stayed on the same level after that

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:58,410
so let's see mostly they're staying on

00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:00,430
the same level I think that's it depends

00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,870
that's kind of a hard blanket statement

00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,480
to make it kind of depends on the type

00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:10,240
of feature and where it's happening but

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:13,150
a lot of these these numbers the those

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,710
animations I showed each of those that

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,270
those animations with the corporate

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,940
editing in green we're showing the

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,380
latest version of the map and so if

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,990
those were showing up that means that

00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,430
that was the most recent edit to those

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,340
objects that hadn't been subsequently

00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,230
edited so a lot of that is a lot of

00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,450
those edits or not are not being

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,620
overwritten or updated by by the

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,660
community but this is certainly

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,880
something that I want to explore now in

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,730
more depth as if you go back to like

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,910
early or 2017 and and now we have all

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:45,220
2019 to look at as well as this data

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:48,400
that's being created as being maintained

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,860
then by by different people or by a

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,110
local community etc this is certainly I

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,730
think an area to to explore and get that

00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,650
question right and it's just really hard

00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,320
to ask so that's kind of exactly what

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,250
I'm trying to dig into thank you very

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:08,090
much

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:10,789
about five minutes more yeah thank you

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:13,820
in the grouping of the the participants

00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:17,200
you had one group which said government

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:20,690
editors with a question mark did you see

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:27,679
those kind of hints in the data that

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:30,830
they might be there I didn't have a way

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,850
currently to to quantify that I was only

00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:36,440
like comparing that against the

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:38,740
corporate editing team list yeah I was I

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,820
really just kind of threw through that

00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,620
graphic together to just show the

00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,929
complexity of the community and the many

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,970
communities within the community and so

00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:48,380
I think that yeah we can definitely try

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,700
to break it down and find editing

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,220
patterns but they're gonna be different

00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,380
among each of these communities but that

00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,330
is certainly I think something to look

00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,950
at beyond this is if we're gonna be

00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,210
classifying you know these types of

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,039
edits and what's happening with like

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,809
corporate editors to also be looking at

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:09,250
all the different other types of edits

00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:12,350
that's happening in there so yeah and

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,480
you have differentiated between maps

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:18,980
sheeting and map gardening it's about

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:21,919
new features and edit on the existing

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:26,330
features have you looked at also an

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:29,210
honor tagging so or are they just just

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:31,039
they are focusing on the geometry but

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,590
are they enriching also the tagging

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,240
system or not yeah so that's something

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,799
that I'm that I'm trying to dig into I

00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,780
think that's that's super important

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,370
that's just a really hard question to

00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,940
ask at scale

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,830
but we can do that now we haven't been

00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,870
able to do that for long but what we do

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:50,090
have infrastructure now in place to do

00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,549
that so I think these are questions that

00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,659
we can now only begin to start answering

00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:56,740
as we've kind of been developing these

00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:59,690
infrastructures in parallel to do that

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,640
do generally I think there is a lot of

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,159
enriching that's happening in tags of

00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,570
just like things I've observed and so

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,880
yeah that's something I definitely want

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,909
to definitely look into further gonna

00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:15,450
collaborate on that that'd be fun

00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:20,340
you are there more questions please one

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:23,009
question there please go ahead hello

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,919
I was just wondering how was the paper

00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:28,879
generally received what kind of feedback

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,879
did you get from us

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,950
[Music]

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:52,170
that yeah that's maybe not there that's

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,170
not helpful that's not helpful to anyone

00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,350
I don't know how it's been necessarily

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,510
received like in academic communities

00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:04,000
yet I haven't heard much like back from

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:07,690
that I have I definitely have heard from

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,670
a lot of the corporate people that like

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:13,990
I think these are valuable tools to be

00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:15,250
using and exploring and I yeah I think

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,930
it's I think it was surprising and

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,030
there's some surprising aspects to it in

00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,860
terms of the quantity especially but I

00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,140
think that I mean more than anything I

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,530
think these are valuable metrics for

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,790
everyone and I mean I've been

00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,220
collaborating to put this together like

00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:32,560
collaborating with with data teams to do

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,660
this work so that's something that's on

00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,250
the corporate side I think the community

00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,530
I haven't heard a ton that got like

00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:41,230
tweeted out and stuff people have talked

00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:43,900
about it but I guess I haven't really

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,480
been curious to definitely would love to

00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:52,210
hear would love to hear more what people

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:58,600
think yeah excellent we have okay we

00:25:52,210 --> 00:26:00,940
have one minute please go ahead I think

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,470
one interesting aspect which which I

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,350
haven't seen elaborate that much but

00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,330
maybe you can comment is whether the

00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:09,280
added contributions of corporate members

00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,980
actually add to the overall volume or

00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,020
they take away by pushing away existing

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,650
members did you look at it from that

00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:23,760
perspective as well that's it that's a

00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:23,760
tough question take away from existing

00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,900
sure sure sure and I think and and

00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:34,280
that's where we need to really drill

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,720
into it because there's those arguments

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,980
are made on both sides of that some

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,270
people would see that and say hey

00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,680
someone came in they mapped all the

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,260
roads already there's no roads for me

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,520
left to map however there's other

00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,770
research out there that shows that

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,450
that's intimidating for users to come

00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,630
across these areas that don't have that

00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,190
data yet and that many mappers when they

00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,290
come into the map I want to be doing

00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,340
densification so they want to be working

00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,570
in areas where somewhere already has

00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,240
worked and they want to fill that

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:02,120
network in and people are more likely to

00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,760
engage with that some people so I think

00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,780
this is where it gets really complicated

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,310
so I don't think it's I don't think you

00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,140
can say one way or the other on that and

00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,790
because research kind of especially

00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,770
showing densification and and not as

00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,780
much showing the other the other way but

00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,890
definitely could think about that as it

00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,290
could be having an effect but that's

00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,790
hard it's kind of hard to quantify but

00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:24,350
definitely I think important to keep in

00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:28,130
mind going forward okay thank you

00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:35,570
oh okay all right one more one more

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:36,830
question then there's it hi this is such

00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,710
a I work at development seed

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,270
thanks Jennings one question so I know

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,760
you've been working on putting together

00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:46,220
all this data or many years do you have

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,380
any asks or suggestions in terms of how

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:52,450
companies may organize their editing

00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:55,190
better so you can get this data faster

00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:57,380
yeah if only someone would put together

00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,820
something or you could organize like

00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:02,180
groups of editors together into like a

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:05,180
team that would be very pretty cool now

00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,770
I think there's a lot of I think there's

00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:10,460
a lot a lot that can be done to like

00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:12,290
make that easier to get to maintain keep

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,610
these lists up-to-date of not just

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,650
corporate editing but all editing all

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:20,180
organized editing and so I think that

00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:23,780
like work like osm team's is huge to be

00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:24,980
able to to kind of look at this I think

00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,870
that's probably the best way best way

00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,010
forward is finding ways to like we're no

00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,780
longer it's no longer just one big

00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,700
community of many individual mappers

00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,650
like this is assemble as a community of

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,450
many many communities and so ways that

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,510
we can have better logical groupings in

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,850
there to do these types of analysis and

00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:42,370
break it down is super is super

00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,160
important to kind of accurately get out

00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,640
the story of how the map is evolving

00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,260
okay brilliant

00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,910
um yeah it seems to me that your

00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,290
presentation has generated a lot of

00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,290
