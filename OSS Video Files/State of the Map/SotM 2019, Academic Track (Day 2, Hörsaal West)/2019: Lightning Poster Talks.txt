Description: 
	Workforce Development and YouthMappers: Understanding perceptions of students in humanitarian mapping.

Patricia Solís and Sushil Rajagopalan

The study tried to understand how and to what extent particular extracurricular (informal) activities through YouthMappers could impact workforce preparation and perceptions among students globally engaged in humanitarian mapping.


Contextualizing OpenStreetMap in Mapping Favelas in Brazil

Everton Bortolini and Silvana Philippi

Favelas in Brazil are spaces with unique characteristics and need to be mapped. Can OpenStreetMap be an alternative tool for this?



How Knowing the Purpose of Mapping Changes the Map and the Mappers Themselves

Patricia Solís

YouthMappers engages university students in humanitarian mapping which provides a potentially valuable learning experience beyond creating the open map. It may also pique new mappers’ interest, satisfaction, and confidence in spatial technologies as well as interest in the people and places that are served by humanitarian mapping projects. This presentation shares findings of a recently published study assessing how contextual information about the purpose of the humanitarian mapping task affects mapping and mappers themselves.

they have five minutes they'll get a

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,430
warning for me at two minutes one minute

00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:19,080
and then

00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:21,990
zero minutes so we are ready to go with

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,060
Patricia solace who's going to talk

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,400
about how how annoying the purpose of

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,080
mapping impacts the map and the mappers

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,090
themselves so you five minutes Patricia

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,540
okay how many of you are based at a

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,870
university how many of you are students

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,010
a couple of them how many of you have

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,680
youth mappers chapters at your

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:50,550
universities okay so I would like to

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,890
invite you to establish or have your

00:00:50,550 --> 00:01:00,210
student groups affiliate with the youth

00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:03,329
mappers network this is 160 universities

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,890
in 42 countries where students lead

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:11,009
their own chapters and groups to form

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:13,320
research to contribute to OpenStreetMap

00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:15,840
and we support them through a number of

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:21,060
different programming with fellowships

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,490
with leadership programs recognition and

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,470
all sorts of things we funded by US

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,229
Agency for International Development and

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,500
we have a strong emphasis on countries

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,960
that USAID serves in the south the first

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,580
talk this that I want to talk to you

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,200
about is how knowing the purpose of

00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,930
mapping impacts the maps and the mappers

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,510
themselves we actually say that we don't

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,900
just build the maps we build mappers and

00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:49,200
that's really where we start there and

00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,439
what is it that the mapping process how

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,220
is the impact on the students that we

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,960
serve they all do some kind of mapping

00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,329
with a humanitarian purpose and

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,680
humanitarian context so wanted to really

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,450
get at that what is that contribution of

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,220
performing the mapping in this way on

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:13,200
the students and how can we tease out

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:16,470
that the fact that they are mapping for

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,269
humanitarian purpose and and their

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,709
experience with building the map and

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:22,230
what they are learning so here's the

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:24,390
original research question and the

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,340
methodology was that this was

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,340
Texas Tech University when I was faculty

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,930
there I had students who were in a

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,150
psychology class they had zero

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,840
experience with mapping they were brand

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,390
new beginner mappers and I divided them

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,440
into two separate groups made sure that

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,360
they were representative of the

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,600
University in terms of ethnicity and

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,120
gender and only one of those groups was

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,260
provided information about the context

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,600
about the location about the

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,600
humanitarian purpose of the task and

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,320
then the control group only learned the

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,850
technical parts about how to map and so

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,830
again the informed group learned about

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,570
the humanitarian context as well as

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,300
youth mappers and we had a project on

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,950
food security that we were mapping in

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:15,390
northern Ghana through one of our other

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:18,269
chapters so quickly.i I measured a

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,370
number of different things what some of

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,810
them were based in the category of sort

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,310
of performance metrics how did they

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,470
actually do what was the productivity

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,050
how good were their edits how many

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,410
errors what types of errors that they

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,970
have and then afterwards you know doing

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,350
surveys both before and after to

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,140
understand their awareness the

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,269
satisfaction motivation and some

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,370
measures of empathy they all measured

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,650
for 30 minutes only and I'll just

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,660
briefly breeze through the results but I

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,090
can show this to you if you come to the

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,890
poster session later so in terms of

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,620
performance measured we learned that

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,630
informed mappers made similar number but

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,489
more types of error than those who were

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,170
uninformed but they reported greater

00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,940
satisfaction and they believed they

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,560
mapped more edits and they thought that

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,260
their work was done better although it

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,230
really was not so conclusion beware of

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,250
the do good effect beginner humanitarian

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,049
offers might believe that they're doing

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,600
well just because they are doing good

00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,579
for the world so we put that into our

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,229
training now to make sure that they

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,950
understand it they might make more kinds

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:22,430
of mistakes but build on them right in

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,000
terms of sort of a general effective

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,530
perspective there's a number of

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,640
statistically significant results where

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,190
you can see with all these stars on

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,110
they're basically uninformed mappers

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,610
grew less positive about technology in

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,169
general they kind of got grumpy after

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,120
doing

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,099
these new technologies that the informed

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,349
mappers were significant more likely to

00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:43,219
say that technology benefits society as

00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:45,199
a whole so this might be one way that we

00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:47,960
can successfully introduce Science and

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,610
Technology by giving it this purpose and

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,699
connecting it to that humanitarian

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:57,770
purpose to new students finally there

00:04:52,699 --> 00:05:01,129
was a ton of a ton of results on empathy

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:03,050
and workforce readiness and the we

00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,300
learned that the informed mappers wants

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,949
to change the world they were wanted to

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,080
be global citizens and give back and

00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:12,710
they were more interested in how other

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,360
people feel so and with this question to

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,849
you could humanitarian mapping become a

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:21,099
place to start to teach empathy thank

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:21,099
you Thank You Patricia next talk is

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,430
contextualizing osm in mapping favelas

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:35,150
in brazil so Cynthia is going to present

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:38,479
so you have the floor so that it okay so

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:42,169
my name is Simona I am I am preaching

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:46,099
for south of Brazil and I'm present here

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:48,979
I started that I was going on with my

00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:53,270
then master students ever talk and now

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:56,870
he is doing a PhD and the introduction

00:05:53,270 --> 00:06:00,349
it's about favelas it's a place is 6% of

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:04,189
Brazilian population lives up to 20% in

00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:05,870
some areas like your Janeiro and there

00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:09,169
are places that are there are a lot of

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,499
informality and social vulnerability and

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:15,830
they're very difficult to map from

00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:18,259
outside or from abroad and so I think

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,379
that we need to engage your local

00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:23,839
population to map these areas both they

00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:26,210
need the the geographic information

00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,899
their legs because most for the

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,550
government they are invisible places and

00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:33,680
still they have a high demand different

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,080
geographic information to improve

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,169
housing and sanitation and a lot of

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,659
services this population needs and we

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:43,249
started in working with this NGO it's

00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:47,089
called the tattoo if you're

00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:50,119
in Latin America building houses using a

00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:53,719
students of university students mainly

00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:57,769
as volunteers and the site if that excel

00:06:53,719 --> 00:07:00,079
map over there it was from people that

00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:02,959
live in the community that they are

00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,809
trying to make maps who use in Excel and

00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,639
when I said that I saw that I say we

00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:11,569
need to do something we have the tools

00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:14,119
to to work with them so the methodology

00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:17,899
of the study it was in the six areas

00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:21,139
with 15,000 residents that the NGO

00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:23,959
orchid and using virtual questionnaires

00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:30,019
and the observation over 200 volunteers

00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:34,939
in these areas he was an actor network

00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:37,369
see rich who observe and using the NGOs

00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:40,879
volunteers as mediators with the

00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:44,509
citizens to make them the mappers and

00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:47,389
this was the final result as we need to

00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,549
train the mediators in cartography you

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:53,149
need to train both citizens and

00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:56,089
mediators with OpenStreetMap tools we

00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:59,569
found that almost half of people use

00:07:56,089 --> 00:08:03,349
access internet by smartphones so we are

00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:06,439
looking at tools to map using smartphone

00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:09,379
not like a traditional computer lab that

00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:12,110
is not easily reachable inside the

00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:15,979
community you have to take people out so

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:19,089
and one main thing it's the motivation

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:23,299
to map it's linked with other activities

00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:25,789
so when we are doing a project for a

00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:27,829
housing for example people are more

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:31,999
motivated to map to that

00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:34,089
then let's go map you're the place where

00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:40,909
you live just because they then

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:44,449
OpenStreetMap you be updated and we have

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:46,790
some issues of your privacy and even

00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:48,699
with tags in OpenStreetMap because the

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,370
conceptual model maybe is not that

00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:54,850
suited for places like that this is one

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:59,590
place before and after the

00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:03,600
in OpenStreetMap and now we are

00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:06,490
currently working with physics because

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,650
it's a lot of effort but if we can

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,680
create a disinformation with locust we

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:14,200
are capacitate them in like a computer

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,490
in school as well and it's good for the

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,580
mediators and but somehow you can put a

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,850
magnifying glasses in a population that

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:28,330
I put that that image over there because

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:31,000
sometimes you can expose it they are

00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,970
already nobility people to the

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,970
government or some asylum environment so

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,770
the Atticus is a big part of it so if

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,230
you'd like to exchange some experience

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,840
we share our ideas and for our group who

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:46,480
have a lot of researchers in developing

00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:54,700
countries that are working opposite map

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:57,370
so presumptuous however I'm standing in

00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,380
for with youth mappers we give our

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,850
students opportunities to do research as

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,430
well but so she'll was not able to

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,110
resolve as a visa situation in time so

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,960
this is on behalf of him and our other

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,990
co-author students about workforce

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,760
development I mentioned that yes we not

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,640
only build maps we build mappers and

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,220
their students are very interested in

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,990
their future careers as you can imagine

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,420
so we have conducted a study this this

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,130
year to evaluate the impact of that

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,650
participation on their workforce

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,690
preparation and this was our global

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,520
network of 160 University in 42

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,850
countries who had the opportunity to

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,860
take this survey and it was open for a

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,410
few months earlier this year the

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,050
analysis included t-test one-way ANOVA

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:44,170
to test for significance demographic

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,270
variables with their particular answers

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,580
to those survey questions and then we

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,470
have a group from the United States

00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,850
Ghana Uganda and Bangladesh are helping

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,400
with that interpretation so that we make

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,480
sure that we get that right

00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:01,060
understanding the results right

00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,830
so in all 223 answers were validated I

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,630
just go very quickly over some of the

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,780
results I'm happy to talk about it later

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,790
but we've what we found was that there

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,980
the longer that the youth mappers were

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,930
participating in our project there were

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,150
statistically significant differences in

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,310
acquisition of or in the use of new

00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,440
tools the acquisition of new skills and

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,840
their own self-reported proficiency in

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,760
using those sorts of things the group

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,260
that we were grouping between people who

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,360
had only participated for less than a

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,160
year between one in two years and then

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,440
two years and above and and on across

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,900
all of those things including geospatial

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,610
competencies they increased as well we

00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,490
learned that the participation in youth

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,980
mappers gave direct opportunities such

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:47,140
as attending conferences getting

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,670
internships and job offers which was

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,980
really really wonderful this was the

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,200
same not statistically significantly

00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,150
different between the female and male

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,720
mappers so they were getting these

00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,550
opportunities equally across genders we

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,590
asked a lot of questions about and these

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,810
are all self-reported about some of the

00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,650
soft job skills as we're as well as

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,580
those hard geospatial competencies and

00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,470
you know they reported learning

00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,720
statistically significant learning

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,480
across both some of the major ones were

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,430
team work sort of preparation for a

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,140
global workforce creative thinking

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,360
critical thinking and civil civic

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,570
engagement were the most often mentioned

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,280
soft job skills and in terms of the the

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,970
geospatial competencies I might just

00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:34,890
point out that through the participation

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:37,930
in this project in their projects they

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:40,450
recognized more visibly the need for

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,560
mobile end-user applications that was

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,030
one of the things that they most often

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,600
that they were not getting in their

00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,700
classwork

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,260
same thing with ethics and ethical

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,180
issues I think that's a really good one

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,190
that getting out in the field but they

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,870
really gained

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,820
finally another set there's a lot more

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:59,800
results but another set of results had

00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:03,520
to deal with who were participating we

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,320
learned that they directly attribute

00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,940
their experiences and being better

00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,320
prepared for their professional careers

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,140
but there was statistically

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,330
significantly higher rates of agreement

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,520
with that form our youth mappers who

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:17,200
were from countries in the south and for

00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,870
our female mappers and this indicates to

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,510
us that having a program that they have

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,920
students

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,170
ship and their own chapter lead

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,170
environment actually was a unique

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,730
opportunity which goes beyond their

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,970
regular curriculum and being able to

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,150
prepare for these kinds of careers so

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,020
just a few takeaway conclusions for you

00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,650
again we really believe in the

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,930
humanitarian mapping as a preparation

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:44,000
not only as a good citizen but also for

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,420
very practical solutions of workforce

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,210
and you know we did see this model and

00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,590
this design of having some statistically

00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,830
significant results for our female

00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,780
mappers we understand that multi-year

00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,970
engagement and staging through the youth

00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,400
mappers process throughout their student

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,790
career is really helping gain more

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,470
access to more tools more skills more

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,570
proficiency and it's a real opportunity

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,010
for students in the global South who may

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,590
not have these same kinds of

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,570
opportunities than any other platform so

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:17,010
thank you thanks to USAID and our other

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:20,840
sponsors

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:22,900
[Applause]
