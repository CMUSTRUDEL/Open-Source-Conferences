Title: 2019: Development after Displacement: Using OSM data to measure SDG indicators at informal settlemen
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Academic Track (Day 2, Hörsaal West)
Description: 
	There are 250 million refugees and IDPs in informal settlements that are routinely excluded from population and settlement datasets as well as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) assessments. Here, we share results from ongoing research to map and assess SDG indicators at global informal settlements using OSM data and satellite imagery. We present a new OSM-driven schema for monitoring SDG progress that counters the exclusion of informal settlements from other assessments.

In 2015, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets to be met as part of its 2030 Agenda. One hundred and ninety three countries declared their commitment to “leave no one behind” in the shared pursuit of SDGs, yet 250 million people around the globe are estimated to be missing from SDGs progress assessments. This presentation focuses on one category of the “Missing Millions”: refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) living in informal settlements in over 60 countries. In part due to the lack of reliable information on the locations of informal settlements, refugee and IDP populations are systematically excluded from national censuses, representative surveys, global settlement and population data sets, and settlement-level SDG progress assessments. If implementation and monitoring of SDG goals are to be truly inclusive of these highly vulnerable populations, a globally systematic, accurate, and open database of informal settlement locations is required. 
In order to locate and characterize informal settlements across the globe, we have used multi-sensor satellite (i.e. Landsat, Sentinel-2, and Planet Dove) imagery, machine learning pattern recognition, and crowd-sourced data collection through visual interpretation of high resolution satellite imagery. With informal settlements identified and using Uganda as a relatively data-rich case study, we developed a spatially discrete and temporally informed settlement-level schema for monitoring SDG initiatives and evaluating progress since 2015. To do so, we examined the distribution of OSM tags relevant for SDG goal indicators, built a database of unique OSM flags for specific SDG indicators, identified relevant OSM features within and nearby informal settlements in Uganda, measured when each feature was first added to the OSM database, and assessed the variability in SDGs progress across a global sample of informal settlements. The presence of SDG-relevant OSM features at some informal settlements may reflect past humanitarian or development mapping, while other informal settlements with less attention in OSM may lack any SDG-relevant OSM features. Since we also sought to assess SDG indicators purely through satellite image analysis, we measured the agreement and complementarity of various remotely sensed measurements of SDG indicators and OSM features. Amenities or public services represented in OSM data such as the designation of a building as a school or health center, and sites of portable drinking water have been essential to formalizing the relationship between satellite-derived estimates of SDG proxy indicators and SDG-relevant features in OSM since these features are not readily identified with satellite imagery and thus are complementary to satellite image-derived indicators. Finally, with an eye on scaling up our assessment to the global-level, we evaluated the relevance of the Uganda-based SDG schema for other geographic regions and specific informal settlements.
The results of this research highlight the value of fusing place-specific OSM data with spatially expansive satellite imagery for assessing progress toward specific SDGs. Further, the analytical framework developed for this project may inform future OSM volunteer campaigns to map and evaluate settlement attributes of vulnerable populations or help guide development practitioners and programming. Many challenges associated with the considerable variability in OSM tags within and between informal settlements remain for developing a settlement-level schema for assessing SDG progress using OSM data. Further, the absence of SDG-relevant OSM features across so many informal settlements highlights the need for a rigorous assessment of potential bias in settlement-level OSM data availability. Future work thus includes a cross-validation between remote sensing and OSM-derived SDG indicators at informal settlements as well as field-based assessment of the settlement schema. Results from this effort will inform how on-the-ground contributors and global end users of OSM data can adopt the proposed settlement SDG schema to better align data collection for SDGs assessment.

State University Research hello there

00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:25,070
which would talk to us about how we can

00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:28,369
use USM to estimate or evaluate

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,990
sustainable development goals so please

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:33,950
sit down and I'll give the flow to

00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:37,699
Hannah hi can everybody hear me okay

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:39,820
okay great um yeah my name is Hannah

00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:43,360
Friedrich I'm a graduate research

00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:46,460
assistant at Oregon State University and

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,070
along with my colleagues and co-authors

00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,920
for this talk Annabelle showed us David

00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,780
rattle and jaemin Bandhan hook in

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,280
collaboration with hot and development

00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,980
seed are working on a project called

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,250
missing millions which uses satellite

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,870
imagery time series analysis with

00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,410
machine learning and crowdsource

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:09,800
based methods to characterize informal

00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:11,710
settlements globally and predict as of

00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,960
yet to be mapped informal settlements

00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:17,900
around the world and as part of the

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,049
missing millions project we're using osm

00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,310
data to conduct a assessment of

00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:26,840
sustainable development goals at

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:28,520
informal settlements so the title the

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,400
talk is development after displacement

00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,570
he was seeing osm data to measure STG

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,400
indicators at informal settlements um so

00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,150
for those of you who aren't aware I'm

00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,990
sure as most of you know of the 2030 UN

00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:48,140
sustainable development goals which were

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,759
kind of first collated in 2015 are

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,110
critical for monitoring development

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,130
progress and making policy

00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:57,560
recommendations leading up to 2030 so a

00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:00,770
total there's a total of 17 goals which

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,450
range from decreasing food insecurity

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,810
increasing accessibility to health care

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:08,709
and education equalizing gender

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,540
opportunities as well as extending to

00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:15,110
making conscious efforts for ecosystem

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:18,110
and conservation these 17 goals have a

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,570
myriad of indicators and total of 169

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,959
targets which are kind of been laid out

00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,860
to meet those indicators and 139

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,780
countries have declared their

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:33,030
in 2015 to leave no one behind and

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:36,450
oftentimes that is a really loaded

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,460
statement and the people that are most

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,890
likely to be left behind in these SDG

00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,740
goals are people who have been forcibly

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,690
displaced from their homes so this

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,830
includes refugees internally displaced

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:52,500
people or IDPs and asylum seekers and of

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,150
this population there's over 70 million

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,120
people that fall into these categories

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,820
so they're often displaced due to armed

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,490
conflict events gender-based violence

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,830
persecution human rights violations and

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:07,560
not only are they seeking safety and

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,060
security elsewhere from their homes but

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,460
they're also seeking basic services like

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:16,260
food health care immediate needs and

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:20,790
opportunities in education and potential

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,160
jobs so of the 70 million people that

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,880
are forcibly displaced refugees account

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,550
for 20 about 20 million or close to 30%

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,920
of that and over two-thirds of that

00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,140
group are considered to be protracted

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,860
refugees so these are people who are

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,120
leaving their home and going somewhere

00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,370
with the opportunity to return to their

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,410
host country is really limited and so

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,170
oftentimes they'll be in a refugee

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,489
settlement for at least five years the

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,560
average current statistic is that a

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,260
refugee will be in a settlement for 17

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,650
years on average so this is something

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,000
that's intergenerational and kind of

00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,700
speaks to the importance of

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,400
understanding how we can use SDGs

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,780
to monitor development at these

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,680
locations where these populations are

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:11,459
and how we can respond to gaps and

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,830
challenges at those locations so since

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,709
2010 the global forcibly displaced

00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:19,590
population has increased fourfold which

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:22,500
is a really staggering statistic when

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,330
you think break it down to the number of

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,720
people that are newly displaced per day

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,930
so in 2010 that was ten people and in

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:36,050
2018 it's almost 40 so there's kind of

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:38,580
again underlines the urgency and kind of

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:42,199
addressing new methods of how we can do

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:45,360
the assessments for these populations

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:48,240
and if we look at a map of the refugee

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,000
populations globally um we see that the

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,400
majority of refugees are in sub-saharan

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,819
Africa or Eastern Africa or the MENA

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,560
regions so if we look at the top hosting

00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:04,860
refugee countries those are turkey

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:08,219
Pakistan and Uganda so not only is there

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,199
a lack of spatial data on locations of

00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:13,500
informal settlements which is reliable

00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,659
and open but we know that refugees and

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,750
IDPs have been systematically excluded

00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:20,099
from national census censuses

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,409
representative and household surveys and

00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,930
global settlement and population data

00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:27,060
sets and this is the information that is

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,960
usually used to kind of track and

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,940
monitor SDGs at a national level so

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,009
there's been notable progress on using

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,409
satellite-based methods or earth

00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:40,340
observation for looking at STG

00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:44,219
indicators but many of the services and

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:48,210
amenities like clinics schools wash

00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:51,990
points you can't track with satellite

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:54,240
imagery there's also a lot of bias and

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,940
lack of standardization and SDG

00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,419
monitoring at different scales so we

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,800
have top-down approaches at the national

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:04,650
and regional levels that don't always

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,409
correspond different countries there's

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:11,009
also locally derived biases that exist

00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:13,440
so one County for example may have a

00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,479
certain method of conducting household

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,210
surveys which is not conducting the same

00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:21,240
manner in different part of the country

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,339
so all this is kind of speaks to the

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,650
lack of measured ICG indicators and

00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,479
informal settlements can have huge

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:31,580
ramifications for refugee response

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:36,659
efforts and future settlement planning

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:38,669
so osm this is where OSEM comes in osm

00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:41,069
faces a lot of challenges but also

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:46,949
presents a lot of opportunities in SGG

00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:48,300
reporting and tracking so walo some data

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:52,319
excel at capturing the site-specific

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,779
features have nominally global coverage

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,339
their use in evaluating STG indicators

00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:58,159
has remained limited it has remained

00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,589
limited and this is mostly due to

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:04,039
inconsistencies and tagging schemes

00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:07,529
variabilities and how we sign tags and

00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:12,110
kind of lack of communication between

00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:16,110
data models and reporting scg targets

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,999
but as osm kind of as a call to this

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,279
presents an opportunity for creating

00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:22,169
more standardized data models for scg

00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,649
mapping across different geographic

00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,580
regional and spatial scales and really

00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:28,860
the driving

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,949
I think opportunity with OSM is the

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,469
field based platform that OSM brings to

00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:37,379
the table much of that is due to the

00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:40,020
efforts of hot um so it really offers a

00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,879
unique perspective on getting at this

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:47,819
really site specific details that

00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:51,240
satellite imagery does not provide so

00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:52,680
our team at missing millions has kind of

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,939
proposed to do this systematic

00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:00,479
assessment of OSM with osm data informal

00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:03,569
settlements so we've created a scg data

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,139
model kind of aligned with how osm data

00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:09,330
models are created based on all possible

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,389
key value pairs that are included at

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:15,979
refugee settlements in uganda and for

00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:19,050
each tag assigned that to each goal

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:21,869
based on crowd based indicators and what

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,080
we know about what each goal is trying

00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:27,089
to address and with that kind of data

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,149
schema we performed an exploratory

00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:32,279
spatial analysis of all osm nodes within

00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:35,219
UNHCR refugee settlement boundaries in

00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:38,610
Uganda to understand the temporal and

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:41,250
spatial distribution of nodes at refugee

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,229
settlements the sources of each node so

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,680
who's creating these nodes who's adding

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:49,759
them to osm as well as a comparison of

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,819
the counts of these nodes compared to

00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:56,130
UNHCR settlement vac sheets and this is

00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:58,290
kind of means of validation and also

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,009
kind of illuminating some of the gaps in

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,009
both datasets

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,040
so this is a map of Pioneer refugee

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,890
settlement in northern Uganda which has

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,010
just kind of a sampling of the possible

00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:16,020
notes that could exist in OS M so we

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,090
have water points market centers

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,270
educational facilities health facilities

00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:25,050
financial services and this kind of I

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:29,030
think speaks to what OS M offers that

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,030
you can't get it with satellite imagery

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:36,810
so this is a screenshot of the OSM data

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,550
model that we've put together so for

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:43,980
each s e-g goal there's kind of the

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:46,620
remote sensing base indicators so for

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,960
poverty we have world pop which is a

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,060
population global population data set

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,590
there's different datasets from CSUN

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,980
which is a group at columbia which uses

00:09:52,590 --> 00:10:01,770
a lot of remote sensing base derived

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:03,720
data sets for socio-economic goals and

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:08,400
then the related OS m tags that we've

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,440
attributed to each goal so if we

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,730
specifically look at the inclusive

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,990
education goal number four we see that

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,580
there are cities and infrastructure

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,280
mapping there's population data sets

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,200
that we can get out with remote sensing

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,300
as a crowd based indicator we can look

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,750
at school locations school size number

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,080
of teachers number of bathrooms and then

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,210
the related osm tags in this case for

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,030
the amenity key we have school

00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,380
kindergarten college child care

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,880
university along with that there's a

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,350
whole other suite of different data

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,660
points that get pulled in with that node

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,700
and for clean water and sanitation we

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,490
kind of have a huge breadth here related

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,610
to the amenity types from toilets to

00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:56,250
wastewater anything wash related that we

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,440
can kind of group into that clean water

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:02,060
and sanitation category we've tried to

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,060
be as inclusive as possible with that

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:11,030
so um in the case of Uganda there's a

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,880
lot of data available largely in part to

00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,470
hot Uganda um so we've kind of decided

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,800
to focus a lot of our preliminary

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,140
attention on how we can roll out this

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,720
STD assessment with the refugee

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,580
settlements in Uganda and this is a map

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,650
showing a refugee settlement

00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:32,810
distribution in Uganda so if we look at

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,960
the temporal distribution in note

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:38,680
frequency in Uganda which is when nodes

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,630
were added to OS M so not exactly

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,820
indicates when that node or when that

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,860
service actually was established on the

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,980
landscape when somebody uploaded it to

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:53,170
OS m we see that most of these nodes are

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:55,940
being uploaded in May of 2018 which

00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:59,390
probably speaks to some campaign that

00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,040
was happening at that time in Uganda but

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:05,230
we know that the majority of settlements

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:09,170
were opened before 2018 so in 2016 2017

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:12,320
2015 so this kind of highlights the lag

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:16,100
that can result with OS m data in scg

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,620
monitoring but we'll kind of circle back

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,660
to this at the end to mention another

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,660
field that could be potentially useful

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:31,130
and this is the source of tie or the m

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,200
the sources that each node can have and

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,820
this is just the raw data so I haven't

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,300
cleaned up or grouped any of these

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:41,030
together but we see that for the nodes

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,670
that exist at refugee settlements most

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:46,390
of them are on a Trudeau or don't have

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:49,160
an attribute um so these are probably

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:53,750
nodes that have been added from remote

00:12:49,160 --> 00:13:00,170
mappers but we also see hot Uganda UNHCR

00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:03,350
MSF youth mappers Ingrid who not sure if

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,150
she's here probably not but um this is

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,160
showing the distance of the nodes from

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,620
the settlement boundary and the

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,110
frequency of them so kind of the main

00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,339
takeaway with this graph is that the

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,220
majority of the nodes are unnatural

00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:19,490
baited there's a variety of sources that

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,410
are creating notes and that the spatial

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,440
distribution of these nodes from the

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:29,030
sediment boundary may kind of illuminate

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:32,170
coverage of nodes so we see with the

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:34,190
UNHCR our site with the hot Uganda

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,380
sources that a lot of the nodes are

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,370
spanning anywhere from like really close

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:42,170
to the border into the settlement itself

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,630
whereas a lot of the UNHCR points are

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:48,470
being tagged at places close to the

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:50,810
settlement boundary so without reading

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:59,120
too much into it that kind of could

00:13:50,810 --> 00:14:00,980
maybe suggest that UNHCR is only

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,810
sampling along the settlement boundary

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,050
itself and not doing a full complete

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:10,390
coverage spatial coverage of possible

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:12,440
nodes that could be added to the map so

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,780
in order to do kind of a side-by-side

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,350
comparison of

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:20,570
known osm nodes we decided to compare

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,240
that with UNHCR settlement fact sheets

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:25,760
and these fact sheets exist for every

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,520
refugee settlement in Uganda and are

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,750
recorded at least once either dating to

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:35,450
January of June 2018 so in addition to

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,980
kind of giving a rough estimation of

00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,200
demographic breakdowns at each

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,450
settlement and having these kind of

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,180
brief text blurbs on gaps and challenges

00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,520
at each settlement it also includes the

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,550
number of motorised bore holes hand

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,670
pumps latrines pre-primary in primary

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:55,720
schools as well as village health teams

00:14:51,670 --> 00:15:00,050
so not all of these data points

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:02,270
translate to OS m tags but we can pull

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,530
out the motorised boreholes hand pumps

00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,490
and latrines and do a side-by-side

00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:10,210
comparison of OS m coverage with UNHCR

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,210
coverage

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:17,780
so in the case of Padrino um this map is

00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:21,170
showing the OSM nodes for schools

00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:23,300
toilets and hand pumps and the table

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:27,050
shows the kind of side-by-side

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:29,840
comparison with UNHCR and OSM so the

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,750
schools was a one-to-one match um we

00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,950
look at toilets UNHCR reported three

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,680
thousand seven hundred and seventy seven

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,720
which are most likely private or

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,510
household toilets

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:44,030
whereas OS m which these notes were

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:46,700
sourced by reach reported twenty nine

00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:49,670
public toilets and if we look at hand

00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:54,020
pumps there was 44 by UNHCR and 34 by OS

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:55,430
M so for this kind of the biggest take

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,490
where I see is the difference in

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:02,210
reporting of private and public toilets

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:04,670
between units ER notice M if we look at

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,130
Navi collie refuse refugee settlement on

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:12,340
with OS M nodes that were sourced by hot

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:16,250
Uganda as opposed to reach we see things

00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:18,230
differences in schools on again same

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,140
kind of pattern with the private versus

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:26,780
public toilets and in the case of

00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:30,140
motorized boreholes slight difference so

00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:33,800
despite the differences between OS mah

00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,240
CR OS M provides a digital contextual

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,940
information that tells perhaps a more

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,080
complete story of s e-g tracking at

00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,820
these locations so school nodes have

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:47,360
information on attendance lighting

00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:50,270
operating hours staff counts what kind

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,970
of energy sources are available to these

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:55,520
sites and toilets include information on

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,370
accessibility lighting hand-washing this

00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,980
is kind of the more nuanced story that s

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,230
e-g tracking is trying to attain on

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:08,959
which we can't always get from these

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:10,610
site reports from UNHCR so in addition

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,740
to this kind of opportunity with OS m

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:17,330
there's also the start date field which

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,430
includes the date of operation of many

00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,540
of these features so we know when the

00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,050
schools were opened

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,199
when clinics were opened which provides

00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,959
a much more kind of nuance

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,700
temporal narrative of these features as

00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:34,889
opposed to just the time snap of when it

00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:36,210
was uploaded to no SM that being said we

00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:38,429
have to recognize the limitations in OU

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,710
some coverage and standardization is

00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:42,570
really important for improving current s

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,549
e-g marketing efforts with OU some data

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,110
so we know that there's a range of tags

00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:48,899
that can be attributed to each goal

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:52,139
there's also a range in sources scales

00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:53,880
how it's reported so Allah the answer to

00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:57,149
a lot of these inconsistencies and

00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,830
uncertainties is at least my takeaway is

00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:04,139
improve data models and documentation so

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:06,240
something to think about as we go back

00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:09,720
to our normal lives after the

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,309
conferences um and kind of wrap up here

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,440
there's a lot of room for growth an

00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:16,590
opportunity that we've kind of learned

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,269
from this preliminary assessment um the

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,860
main takeaways being that the settlement

00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:22,649
boundary data is really critical in

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:26,010
providing location data so even wearing

00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:29,789
knowing where to look for scg indicators

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:32,610
on secondly the field generated osm data

00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:37,500
is super critical for offering a more

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:38,399
contextual analysis of these SDGs so our

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,309
kind of goal is with the missing

00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:44,100
millions project is to align with and

00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:47,120
learn from the hot STG data model is

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,139
they have their own ongoing efforts to

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,870
create a data model that incorporates

00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:54,450
tags that can be attributed to each SDG

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,039
goal on and there's also this

00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,860
opportunity to conduct field work next

00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:03,029
year to validate some of these analyses

00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:09,260
that we've conducted so these are my

00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:09,260
references and thanks for attending

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,250
so taking Hana for an interesting talk

00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:28,299
about a very important topic there's

00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:30,250
enough time for questions okay over

00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:33,269
there

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,269
[Music]

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:48,250
I yeah thanks very much for a really

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:51,210
interesting presentation I got the

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,500
feeling we just kind of did it into the

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,970
shower surface or what's a very

00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,280
interesting topic

00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:02,470
you mentioned exploratory spatial data

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,730
analysis just broadly speaking maybe you

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,020
could tell us a little bit about that

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:10,660
what kind of methods you used for worked

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,700
yeah so we've something I'm really

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,260
interested in is the spatial

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,410
distribution of nodes within the

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:20,740
settlement itself so how close certain

00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:22,300
amenities are to the boundary because

00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,900
the boundary kind of operates as this

00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:28,660
informal exchange between refugees and

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,660
host communities by looking at the

00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,490
spatial distribution of certain features

00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:36,790
may illuminate kind of certain patterns

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:39,760
in the socio-economic conditions within

00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:43,600
the settlement so there's kind of been

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,400
this like exploratory data analysis

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,320
that's not really driven by certain

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,520
questions about that but just seeing

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,590
what patterns are revealed with that

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:56,520
just as an aside um I don't know if you

00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:59,020
I noticed the population is one of the

00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,920
Earth Observation data sets that you're

00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,800
aware of and you mentioned the

00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,830
population data set Facebook recently

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,559
released 30 meter gridded data globally

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:12,340
yeah is this the high-resolution yeah

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,830
yeah yeah we're yeah we are using that

00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:17,429
in some of our analysis okay thank you

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,429
yeah

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:29,290
more questions

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:33,250
okay so I'll ask you something I know

00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:36,640
from from Israel or or from the

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:41,260
Palestinian territories that mapping

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:46,000
such mapping informal areas could be

00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:49,930
very politically Laden and some

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,540
populations don't want to be mapped do

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:56,110
you know of any experiences in those

00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:58,780
areas or people don't have a stable

00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,420
ground to sitting and may fear that the

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,910
data would be used against them and yeah

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,130
this is like an internal conversation

00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:08,170
we've been having and like a question I

00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:11,710
think the missing minds project is

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:13,300
really grappling with is what are the

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,190
ethics of sharing this location

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,020
information on highly vulnerable

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:21,070
populations who maybe don't want their

00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:23,890
location known I'm so I don't have an

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:26,710
easy answer your simple answer to that

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:29,020
um we've kind of thrown around the idea

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:32,040
of maybe using fieldwork as a means to

00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:35,190
gain permission from people just like

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:38,650
tell them what we're doing and see me if

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,750
they want to if their location they want

00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:44,640
to be included in the final data set

00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:49,270
that gets shared with people I'm but

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,790
yeah it's really complex I think kind of

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,190
like the initial goal is to share the

00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,650
data set with like a very small group of

00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,210
like humanitarian or people who are on

00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,980
the ground who could provide services to

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,980
these population as opposed to just

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:07,090
putting it out and open like on osm off

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:09,930
the bat um but yeah there's a lot to

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,930
think about with that question

00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,819
[Music]

00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:23,690
so as a follow-up to that question I'm

00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,850
from Canada and we went have gone

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,470
through the whole process of

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,230
reconciliation with indigenous

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:33,170
population and they have treaty rights

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:36,950
so very interesting to see how to

00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:39,260
overlay this in downtown Toronto treaty

00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:43,160
rights and get them to debate you know

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:45,470
what what we do here and rather than

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,960
just looking at the SDGs at a global

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:51,290
level and then like your point here is

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,630
it Rheda has no contextual component at

00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,370
that local level the other thing is the

00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:59,030
University of Waterloo is looking at how

00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,740
to use AI to search through the local

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:03,200
municipal documents like your fact sheet

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,480
for example and then feed that into a

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,840
community well-being indicator so it's

00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,060
it's a live process rather than you know

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,530
scraping websites or waiting two years

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:20,180
down the road until you analyze a

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:21,350
document from a government so there's a

00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:25,780
question of like how can I have like

00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,780
more real time monitoring assessments or

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:40,510
[Music]

00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:42,730
yeah um I mean I think the the model of

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,520
including people on the ground and data

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:59,620
generation is like the first step in

00:24:45,520 --> 00:25:02,470
that um I'd like the comparison part of

00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:08,950
it yeah we're just looking at the the

00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:11,530
fact sheet counts on which you know the

00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:14,440
validity of which I can't really speak

00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:18,430
to you but um I think there's definitely

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:22,270
a lot of limitations in giving a whole

00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:24,940
settlement kind of snapshot in a two

00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:29,440
page PDF but I don't know if that

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:32,110
answers your question but yeah next last

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,390
quest quick question please hey Hannah I

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:38,140
was just curious about the the ground

00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:42,120
truthing part of it as far as what will

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:44,680
be the goal of that is it to see the

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,130
validity of one data set over the other

00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:50,860
or to update with the time because a

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:53,230
year in these settlements is often has

00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,600
significant amount of change so are you

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:58,840
looking at the validity of the ground

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,440
work from 2018 to now or the comparison

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:05,140
of UNHCR data sets to Hots data sets for

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,520
example yeah I think that's something

00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,770
that's still kind of up in the air in

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,270
terms of what the main goal is with the

00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:15,250
fieldwork part of missing millions um

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:17,890
I'd be really interested to do like go

00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:21,520
to sites that aren't included in osm or

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:23,830
haven't previously been mapped on the

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:30,070
ground so like going to IDP sites in

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:33,670
Uganda and seeing kind of what why there

00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:35,230
isn't data at those sites um what puts

00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,620
sets those sites

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,539
aside from

00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,630
the attention from refugee settlements

00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:47,720
um yeah I don't know in terms of a

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:49,580
validation it seems like there's a lot

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,390
of kind of rabbit holes to go down with

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,730
in terms of you know critiquing the

00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,049
temporalities of it but I think it's

00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,750
still kind of unknown what the goal what

00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,980
the fieldwork is okay thank you very

00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,279
much

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,590
yeah now you're let's our another round

00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:08,730
of applause

00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,730
