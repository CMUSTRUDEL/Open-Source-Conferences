Title: 2019: Bridging the Map? Exploring Interactions between the Academic and Mapping Communities in OpenS
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Academic Track (Day 2, Hörsaal West)
Description: 
	This talk presents an initial inquiry into the relations between the Academic and Mapping communities in OpenStreetMap, based on a review of recent publications, interviews of colleagues, and self-reflection of the authors. By this, we aim to understand how and when research-community interactions come to be, what is their nature, and how can these be improved and made more productive for both sides.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) can be conceptualized in a multitude of ways: it may be seen as a database, as a platform, as a concept, as a community (or collection of communities), as a social practice, etc. The academic research on OpenStreetMap adopts and utilizes these different conceptualizations, creating various forms of inquiry. For example, quality-related inquiries can be linked to the data/platform perspectives, contributor behaviors are analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively from a more behavioral perspective, and social understandings of OSM are utilized in inquiries into the institutional and community dimensions of the project. Indicative of a more general issue in the relations between geo-information and socio-cultural contexts, these readings of OSM do not represent absolute truths, but rather they emerge from the specific personal, professional, and socio-cultural backgrounds of OSM researchers (OSM-R). Furthermore, they hold the potential to create an effect on the world and specifically on OSM and its communities. However, the extent and nature of these relations in OSM-R, and specifically relations between research and the OSM community (OSM-C) have not received much academic attention yet. This is despite such interactions existing, e.g. when research outputs are presented to the community, when OSM contributors (OSMappers) become researchers themselves and vice versa, or on other occasions.
 Efforts to establish and strengthen the interaction between OSM-R and OSM-C have already resulted into significant outputs, e.g. the creation of a dedicated ‘OSM science’ mailing list and the stable inclusion of an Academic Track into the annual State of the Map conference. In this talk, we make a step further in the exploration of this issue, with the objective of not only better understanding these interactions but also formalizing an agenda for future OSM-R endeavors. Specifically, we look at the interactions between OSMappers and research communities, analyzing how the two affect each other, what are the implications of these interactions for both the researchers and the community, and how could these be changed to enhance relations and make them more productive ones. While this issue can be studied from the perspectives of both OSM-R and OSM-C, we focus on an initial exploration of the former.
 For this purpose, we employ two techniques. First, we review OSM-R publications from recent years (2016-2019) and, in addition to classifying them according to the researchers’ background discipline and the topic, consider what type of conceptualizations of OSM are employed there, and whether and how interactions with the OSM-C are considered explicitly. We use this analysis to make an initial assessment of the state of the issue in the field and identify how specific topics/backgrounds affect the ways in which OSM is conceptualized in research. Second, we collect detailed records of experiences of OSM-R/OSM-C interactions via the self-reflections of the authors and interviews with colleagues. While far from representative of the entire field, these allow a deeper observation of the causal processes that lead to the adoption of certain perspectives and to the development (or lack) of OSM-R/OSM-C interactions. In such a way, we gain insights into how researchers that are also mappers manage their different community roles and sets of objectives, when interactions (if any) happen, what their nature is, who initiates them, who dominates them, and why these came to be that way. Furthermore, these reflections allow speculation on how things could have been done differently, which opportunities were missed, and what possibilities exist. Thus, the combination of a view of current research status with an understanding of processes and forward-looking thinking allow us to point towards possible steps and procedures OSM-R could consider in order to create an impact on OSM-C and to enhance research via an understanding of OSM as a community.

so a handover now to Marco and year who

00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,280
will

00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,280
a joint presentation from all of

00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,570
good morning everyone welcome again to

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,090
the academic track at state of the map

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,220
so happy to see you here

00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,590
it's not always easy after a social

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,079
event so thanks again for coming so my

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,789
name is Marco Mangini and I'm speaking

00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,500
on behalf of the academic track

00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:36,559
Scientific Committee which is also

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,250
composed by iron greenberger Peter

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,170
Mooney and Godwin Yeboah and also

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:46,659
levente u1 who unfortunately could not

00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:50,510
be here but we send him our greetings so

00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:53,720
just before starting I would just like

00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,970
to to say that both last year in Milan

00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,030
and also this year or the past few weeks

00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:01,400
we got a lot of emails and people asking

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,290
whether the academic track talks are

00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,080
open to all conference participants of

00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,510
course the answer is yes and it's even

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,030
more than yes I mean you are all very

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,110
very welcome to stay here to listen to

00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,540
the academic track and please

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,250
participate in the track so ask

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,720
questions approach the speakers even

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,000
question what the speakers are saying

00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,939
because this is exactly the purpose of

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,939
the track and in this very spirit the

00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:28,280
first talk actually is given from us and

00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:29,929
it will be about an exploration of the

00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,759
interactions between the academic

00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:35,420
community and the academic research on

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,810
OSM and the whole community just before

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,820
diving into this just a brief

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,439
introduction of the academic track as

00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,810
you might know this is the second

00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,390
edition of the track after the first and

00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,749
very successful one we had in Milan last

00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,429
year this year you will see 20

00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:55,340
contributions we accept the 20 you will

00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:58,100
see 18 of them presented as oral talks

00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,770
we will have 13 regular talks like this

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,119
one and 5 lightning talks again

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,729
lightning talks will be in this room

00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,280
just after this session so please stay

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:11,270
here and we will have 6 posters later on

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,880
today in the poster session the sum is

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,620
not 20 is 24 because some of the posters

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,780
are also presented as lightning talks

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,730
ok so we are particularly happy of the

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,530
quality of the talks and posters but

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,500
also of the variety of them so if you

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,780
decide to stay here today

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,240
you will listen to talks coming from

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,900
authors working in different disciplines

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,630
and particularly we will also have a

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:43,450
tall given by a company just to show

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:45,550
that the width of research topics and

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,080
research disciplines involved in OSM and

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,700
also many many different topics so you

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,350
will listen to talks about the quality

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,580
of the data about the contribution

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:56,709
patterns but most important applications

00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,140
of voice and with outcomes results

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:02,320
relevant for the whole community this is

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,600
our schedule just some numbers to

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,250
compare the submissions and the accept

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,320
the submissions of last year and this

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,670
year you can see from the table on the

00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,560
right that the situation is overall

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,150
quite similar but I would like just to

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,290
draw your attention on a couple of

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:20,020
numbers first is 45% over there which is

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,000
the percentage of abstracts caused by

00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,300
people from more than one country which

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,400
is a lot because it means health almost

00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,010
all of the abstracts and also twelve

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,380
people are look at the bottom line

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,150
twelve people contributed and accepted

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,070
abstract both last year and this year

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,049
which tells us that the research

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,959
community is actually active its table

00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:42,850
is nature is very diverse geographically

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,190
speaking but also diverse in terms of

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,190
disciplines in terms of topics and still

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,989
developing currently how does the

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,330
integration with the OSM community

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,190
happen let's say officially through the

00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,100
academic track but also through these

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,630
osm science mailing lists not sure if

00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,390
you are all aware of this this is a

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,690
mailing list active since January 2017

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:06,190
and especially created and dedicated to

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,200
scientific applications and discussions

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,150
about OpenStreetMap of course it's open

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,160
to everyone but it's clear that

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,040
interactions also happen in many other

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,030
ways and channels mostly because many

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,739
osm scientists like me like us are also

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,350
or some upwards and contributors and

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:26,470
users so this is exactly the reason of

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,840
our talk so we will try to explore the

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,510
dimension of these interactions and the

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,040
effect that it has on both the

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,020
scientific and the no scientific

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,870
community and I will pass the microphone

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,289
to the aisle for the details of this

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,409
work

00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:44,469
Thanks Thank You Marco I'm very happy to

00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:48,879
see all of you and as Marco gave him a

00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:51,460
tapa action this is a bit of a study

00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:54,279
about science about how science in the

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,460
context of OpenStreetMap is carried so

00:04:54,279 --> 00:05:00,699
it is framed with our general

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,369
understanding of science that switched

00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:06,309
from the idea of having a very objective

00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:09,369
researcher which is non participant in

00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:12,759
to ideas that talk about researchers

00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:16,599
acting within paradigms within a set of

00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:19,539
values and that research evolves and

00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:22,449
science evolves for interactions and the

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:24,719
two studied that looking at labs but

00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:27,279
it's true for every type of science

00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:29,649
people researchers interact with each

00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:33,309
other interact with their subject of

00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:35,550
study and by that they may get affected

00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:37,479
or may adopt different

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:42,459
conceptualizations of their own object

00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:44,469
of study and OpenStreetMap is open to

00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:47,199
many different kinds of interactions

00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:51,159
like this conference like mapping like

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:54,789
just using the data and are what drives

00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:56,620
us in this research is the idea that the

00:05:54,789 --> 00:06:00,490
engagement with the OpenStreetMap

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,229
community probably affects the kind of

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,740
research that is being carried and

00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,029
that's what this talk is about so we're

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,839
first of all we're trying to understand

00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:13,649
what kind of engagements are there how

00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:16,930
they're related to the way researchers

00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:19,209
conceptualize the OpenStreetMap and how

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,399
they're those two things engagement in

00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:24,729
conceptualizations affect the actual

00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:27,009
research that happens and also when

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:30,219
trial will try to finish with maybe a

00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:32,319
more normative or not necessarily an

00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:35,860
academic contribution but thinking about

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:41,169
how can we bridge the map according to

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:43,659
the mode of of this conference how can

00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,449
what can we do to make our some research

00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:50,110
better integrated into the OSM community

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:51,650
and vice-versa so how did we do that

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,160
what's this

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,990
study is based on well mostly about a

00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,320
review of literature of publications

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:03,940
from the last four years basically 2016

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,080
to 2019 we used Google Scholar to find

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:11,740
publications with openness treatment or

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:15,919
OSM in their title that resulted in 181

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:18,530
publications this talk is based on 136

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,940
of those eight were removed because they

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:26,990
were not in English or not about our osm

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,880
about different osm and some of them

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,000
frankly we still haven't had the chance

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,540
to explore so 156 is still nice number

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,780
we also collected Auto reflections self

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:42,950
reflections like we wrote to ourselves

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:44,570
how did you come to study osm how do we

00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,180
think of us and what word our

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,310
interactions and we're also interviewed

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,220
some researchers that relate towards a

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,889
more user assignment in the research and

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,169
try to understand how do they understand

00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:59,539
OpenStreetMap and what's the history of

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:01,430
their interactions and how do they view

00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:03,350
the future of both research about

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,410
OpenStreetMap and open straighten

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:11,120
himself so this top would mainly focus

00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:14,150
on the first part the paper review with

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,120
some initial insights from the latter

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:20,150
one so the first question research

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,360
questions we had is how does open

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:27,740
research the research community engages

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,560
with OpenStreetMap and what we did was

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,380
read the papers basically look at things

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,080
like the abstract the conclusions the

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,169
method even the acknowledgments and try

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:43,610
to find any evidence of engagement with

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:47,870
the community and 60% of the papers had

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:50,390
shown no sign of engagement but the

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,400
other categories and I'll go briefly

00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,490
through them so we have acknowledgement

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,709
so basically just acknowledging the help

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,630
and the advice of people from the

00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:03,280
community that's the in terms of

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:05,340
engagement the most frequent one we have

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,200
occasional development so that's

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,760
like in the conclusion section someone

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,950
saying oh the results of this study

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,960
could be used to help the OpenStreetMap

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,360
community or help the data quality and

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,630
so on so that's the second most frequent

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,750
then we have actually studies of the

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:24,740
community indirect meaning studying the

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:30,720
traces of the community of mappers so

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:33,000
analyzing the history of the data we

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,840
also have which is becoming less and

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,550
less frequent as we go down the erect

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,700
study meaning actually engaging with

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:48,240
mappers and asking them about the

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:50,430
procedures and the categories that list

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,580
frequents our papers that were written

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:57,540
in an attempt to contribute to the

00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,450
community explicitly and so that's

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,920
contribution and meaningful development

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,280
so in contrast with occasional

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,680
development people actually talking

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,830
specific procedures for integrating the

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,460
results back into the community so it's

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:17,420
like in hindsight but still some kind of

00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,950
willingness and thought about engagement

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,580
the second thing we want to know is how

00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:26,990
does this engagement relates to the kind

00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,730
of views that the papers express about

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,130
openness treatment about the

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:35,540
conceptualizations so in this graph I

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:39,180
hope you can see the colors well enough

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:41,040
the figure the line the more papers that

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,350
were belonging to the same two

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,500
categories so the categories were used

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,100
for for conceptualizations first of all

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,140
o sm as a data source I think that's a

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,560
self explanatory data produced by

00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,540
contributors so that's saying osm is a

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,180
data source but there are people behind

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,640
it and kind of finishing with that so

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:06,030
it's still very data-centric

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,980
then we have contributors producing data

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,800
so that's already switching to more

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,600
weight on the mappers themselves a

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,400
collaborative project based on

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,120
contributors so talking more about the

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,510
project talking about community either a

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,570
unified one

00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,890
the entire body of mappers or a

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,130
community of community that's the

00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:29,440
diverse community and finally a social

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,140
product a set of procedures or practices

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,080
that create the data and create the

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:38,110
project and actually affect the mappers

00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,030
and what we can see here first of all

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,610
that the data centric view is the most

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,800
dominant and it's the one that is

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,840
related to the no engagement so we

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,900
already see a relation here people that

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:53,560
do not engage with the community or at

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:56,350
least don't show signs of engaging also

00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,810
the ones that tend to use OpenStreetMap

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:05,290
as a data source but when we go into

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:08,410
more direct contact or even indirect

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,510
object of study indirect object study

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,510
direct contribution we can see that the

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:16,660
weight the thickness of the line we can

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,880
of data centric views becomes thinner

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,440
and thinner and ideas like social

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:26,470
product like a diverse community becomes

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,180
more more gets more weight basically so

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,810
there are already evidence that

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:37,270
engagement leads to more complex notions

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:39,580
of the community and of the project but

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,530
what did people actually research so

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,400
that's a word cloud based on the titles

00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:47,500
after removing stop words and D

00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,440
capitalizing everything so we can see

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:55,180
that data is very centric and above it

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:57,460
quality using so using OpenStreetMap for

00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,440
so you can see the dominance of still

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,110
that idea of OpenStreetMap as a data

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:07,840
source we can see a lot about land users

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:12,580
so building urban land road up above

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:16,230
quality and that's that's also related

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:19,840
to many land use land cover

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:23,020
classification papers that look at the

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,010
data but evidence for thinking about the

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:29,080
mappers themselves are not as strongly

00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:32,350
evident here so you can see if you feel

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,660
quality land routing and then you have

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,000
like

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,630
communities and volunteered in small

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,890
smaller smaller print so you can see

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:44,870
that the notion of studying the

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:50,840
community is still not getting much

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:55,070
weight and we ask yourself how does that

00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:58,910
relate to the engagement levels and to

00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:01,760
the kind of conceptualizations and it's

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:08,810
clear to see that all application

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:11,780
meaning okay meaning meaning that using

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:15,080
osm for and data quality research the

00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:19,520
data centric kind of approaches are very

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,550
much related to the no engagement and to

00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,400
the data centric views but once you go

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:29,990
into more engagement and more looking

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:34,160
more more thinking more about the people

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:39,410
behind it the kind of approaches that we

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:42,830
use are are the kind of research that we

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:47,120
use are more looking into contributing

00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:49,690
the community and so on I'll have to

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:54,080
skip quickly through stuff so I

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:56,030
apologize so we started to think of

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,550
where can we enhance the engagement

00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:01,220
where can we see gaps so looking at the

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,500
author's disciplines according to their

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,200
affiliations in the paper we can see

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,300
that engagement is more evident in the

00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,210
more social fields mainly geography but

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,890
also social sciences with the exceptions

00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,780
of computer science and geo information

00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:18,740
which are basically more technical

00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:23,950
fields but so more diverse means of

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:26,690
engagement and of and of more diverse

00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:30,620
conceptualizations but when we turned to

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:32,300
look at the journals disciplines what we

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,490
can see and I'm sorry I'm not hanging

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:39,290
too much about the the graphs because

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:41,960
I'm short on time is that it seems that

00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:44,330
the journals the the publication outlets

00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,570
and for some kind of imaginary so

00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,840
computer science that was very diverse

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,220
more oriented towards the data and

00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,780
geography becomes more oriented towards

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:58,660
the social product I'll skip quickly

00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,250
through those and we also try to

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,250
understand the geographical relations

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:06,310
and we classified each paper according

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:10,270
to the overlap between the author's

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:12,730
origin and the study areas they used so

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:16,410
one means the use they study the same

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:24,190
area they live in zero that they studied

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:26,530
another area 0.66 means some of all

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,090
study areas had others coming from them

00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:34,060
but some others weren't from the study

00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:36,100
areas and 0.33 means that some study

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,340
areas had authors coming from them but

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:43,000
not all study areas so a bit away from

00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:47,140
home and what we can see that in the

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,660
perspective area at least well in both

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,120
cases either people studied close to

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,540
home or rate from home that's the most

00:16:52,120 --> 00:17:00,280
popular thing but the data centric view

00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:03,460
is much more dominant closer to home ok

00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:06,370
so it kind of give us the insight that

00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:09,730
people that think of areas that are away

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:13,720
from from from their home encounter more

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:20,110
stuff and develop a more complex idea

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:25,000
about OpenStreetMap so we try to get

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:28,590
into engagement via the interviews and

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,490
to establish some kind of causality and

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,770
through the interviews and personal

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,290
reflections and what we can see well

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,870
certainly engagement affects the

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,820
complexity when people talked about it

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,910
they acknowledged that and we could see

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,940
free tracks and osm academics someone

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,780
that's reading or that engaging with

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,450
OpenStreetMap but doesn't become a

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:54,100
mapper which shows kind of the more

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:56,260
basic understanding or academic that

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,810
becomes a a matter that has a developing

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,450
understanding and a mapper that becomes

00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:03,610
an academic

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:07,270
which is kind of logical but doesn't

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,590
have to be the first community that you

00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,540
contact with in OpenStreetMap

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,040
greatly affects how you interact with

00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:16,210
the community and you're really in

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:18,580
connects to share your research there's

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:21,130
the issue of how much being a mapper

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,140
affects me being a researcher and vice

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,710
versa and that's mostly seems to be

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:29,200
unconscious and well it seems that

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,470
people that are least engaged are the

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,049
ones that are more willing to discuss

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:41,169
the basic assumptions and and data

00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:43,150
structures or OpenStreetMap so we saw

00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:45,460
some meaningful relations I think we can

00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,020
say safely that the way we interact with

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,080
the community affects the way we do

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,059
research and maybe even that our

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,480
engagement affect our ability to look

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:58,390
beyond the laws and data structure where

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,400
can we improve that that was the last

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,500
question so we need to work outside our

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,480
comfort zone both in terms of stepping

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,540
outside our discipline and going away

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,700
not using our area going to areas that

00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,049
we don't understand we need to raise an

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,840
awareness to the complexity between

00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:16,240
technical fields and we need to increase

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,880
communication with the mapping community

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,580
and get their views on that which would

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,940
be a follow-up research and this is how

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:27,760
we're gonna yeah we briefly close this

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,380
presentation with the outcomes that we

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,350
have for this year's academic track in

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,240
addition to the talks and to the posters

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:37,540
first outcome is the proceedings you may

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,280
be aware that we collected all together

00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,830
the accepted abstract we plug them into

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,650
a single volume and we publish it's some

00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,720
days ago it's openly accessible to

00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,720
everyone and they're cc-by so from this

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,630
QR code or directly from the academic

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,070
track page on the conference website

00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:57,250
also I'm happy to announce that we will

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:59,169
have a special issue on high rank

00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,450
scientific journals still we need to

00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:02,919
decide the journal probably this

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,110
decision will be taken in a couple of

00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,850
weeks after the conference what is sure

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,549
is that the title will be OpenStreetMap

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,510
as a multidisciplinary nexus

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:13,000
perspectives practices and procedures

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,290
and it will be open to everyone

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,680
so not just to the authors who are

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:20,390
presenting their tones today in the very

00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,670
spirit of OSM we will have an

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,920
open-access special issue we are kind of

00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,440
negotiating now we join us the best

00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,590
possible conditions in terms of article

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,960
processing fees because if you are

00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,550
academic you know very well that

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:38,780
publishing under open access often means

00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:41,870
you have to pay so just as a final

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:44,300
invitation for all of you get registered

00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,640
to the OSM science mailing list help us

00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,920
to keep this mailing list active share

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,280
your doubts share your questions but

00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:55,070
also not just there but also in other in

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,890
other channels and in other lists of

00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,690
course because again we are academics

00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:02,450
but we are all part of one single

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,190
community and we all need each other so

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,590
finally I would like just to thank

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,870
people from the state of the map working

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,970
group especially Christine and the mica

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,630
but also people or people from either

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,610
Berg especially Martin that was really

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,790
really supporting together with the

00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:21,170
local the state of the map group they

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,630
were really really supporting the

00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,100
academic track and allow us to be here

00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,750
and to run this very successful track

00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:33,710
finally again thank you very much for

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:35,360
attending Thank You Marco we're just

00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,520
going to allow one question and that

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,980
will bring us to start the next session

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,320
at 9:30 and allow the room change so

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:50,270
first person to poster hand up that I

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:52,280
can see patricia out of the ten

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,830
interviews how many of those were women

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,480
of the ten qualitative interviews that

00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:00,310
you did with the the qualitative

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,310
perspectives how many of them were women

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:11,840
there's a bias there's a bias there were

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:15,740
let me think about it there were at

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,930
least two out of out of the ten at least

00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,060
two out of the ten

00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:26,380
I'm running the names right now in my

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:29,360
mind but I I don't remember exactly but

00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,610
at its a bias that reflects the bias

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,250
within the research community so yeah

00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:40,510
women researchers are harder to come by

00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:40,510
but if you want to contribute yeah

00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,920
okay if there's one quick question there

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,920
when the room is empty

00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:58,220
okay so I'll tank the speakers on behalf

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,220
of myself we have a question up there

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:08,370
Thanks um it looked like you were you

00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,110
were looking at specific phrases that

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,000
people used which made me wonder if it

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:15,390
if some of those phrases came from

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,620
citations and it also suggested when you

00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,750
looked at the journals that people are

00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,970
using similar language I wondered if you

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,710
can use that to identify whether people

00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,720
are all citing in a certain direction

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,190
and then you can choose people who may

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,020
be nodes that you could actually speak

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,370
with and say hey you're you're

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,240
influential in the community is that

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:35,220
something that you you've thought about

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:39,360
well no apparently thanks for the

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:42,000
suggestion I would I would suspect that

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,130
if you look back at reference networks a

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,280
citation networks it would lead firstly

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,190
to good job yeah and to some of the

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:53,790
people in the scientific community again

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:57,930
deciphering Scientific Committee yeah

00:23:53,790 --> 00:24:00,090
but I think it could it could be an

00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,560
interesting addition and that's

00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:06,630
something we can look at thank you for

00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:10,140
the submission so as a follow-up to that

00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:13,560
question governments are looking at

00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:17,250
alternative ways of leveraging data open

00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:20,550
data to support policy work a lot of

00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:25,580
that is in the direction of open open

00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:28,920
data open government and my question is

00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,850
have you considered any linkages through

00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:34,140
through the format of citizen science

00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,180
we're seeing some of that citizen

00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,090
science for example the Great Lakes

00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,800
basin the government put out a proposal

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:43,350
to look at ways of you leveraging

00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,550
citizen science to help them ground

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:48,740
truth the data that they're collecting

00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:52,270
and analyzing through a machine learning

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:55,570
well what thanks for the question

00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:58,450
so what what you're asking is basically

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:00,870
about another set of actors that are

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:04,450
related here and that's that's a

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:08,830
government or public agencies that that

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:12,130
try to use the data and have have an

00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:15,100
interest in the data and at the moment

00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:17,380
where there are certainly part of the

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,360
system or triangle or maybe even more

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:24,309
than that at the moment we're focusing

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,740
on on the research Avenue and the

00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:30,340
origins of that and actually that didn't

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:33,670
come up too much in the in the

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:37,270
interviews the words are mentioning of

00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:40,990
Industry of working for public

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,460
organizations or industry but we're not

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,040
considering that explicitly because

00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:48,970
we're trying to look at first of all at

00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:52,840
those two communities and as long as as

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:55,390
we don't see any very impactful

00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,740
connection about that it effects

00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,990
conceptualization that affects

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,250
engagement will stay there but that

00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,970
certainly is something that we need to

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,970
