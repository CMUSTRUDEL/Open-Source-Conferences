Description: 
	Gregory Marler and the OSMF Working Groups, State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/X005-Get_involved_in_the_OpenStreetMap_Foundation/

Do you want to help the OSM Foundation in a more active way than donating money, mapping or software development but you do not know which working group to join? This session gives you what you are looking for. After a short introduction talk by Gregory Marler, the session changes into a fair-like open space. One or two members of each working group are waiting at defined locations to answer your questions. It is the opportunity to get in touch with the working groups and their work. Donâ€™t miss it.

Due to the interactive nature of this session taking place around the auditorium, only the introduction talk was filmed.

	00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,890
so I think some people are still coming

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,800
down from the other groups because I was

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,330
up there and had to rush but while

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,000
you're waiting hopefully you all know

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,710
about the social event this evening in

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,500
old fashioned Milano currently there's a

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,890
map called OpenStreetMap talk that you

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,130
can use to get there there's also this

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:34,559
map that I edited from there the MT

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:38,100
metro line you can get Cadorna and it's

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,410
that low F there it's a part of a

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,460
building in a in a beautiful park and

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:52,620
they'll be drinks and food and

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:54,600
OpenStreetMap as OpenStreetMap as there

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,659
should be

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,659
[Music]

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:26,650
hey the people still coming down from

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:34,420
your group is he banned

00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:34,420
[Music]

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:49,509
right a thinker will just start then I

00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:51,899
thought this might be a bit busier so

00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:55,950
I'm going to talk about the

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,950
OpenStreetMap foundation

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,789
so the OpenStreetMap foundation

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:08,190
hopefully you've heard of it's an

00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:11,650
international not-for-profit

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,430
organization it doesn't control the

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,769
OpenStreetMap project but it supports it

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:22,569
and it does that in various ways

00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:24,970
it runs the law of the the servers that

00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:29,200
run things like OpenStreetMap - org and

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:30,850
a few other things it this is the

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,489
conference of the OpenStreetMap

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:38,590
foundation that you're at so you're at a

00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:42,549
foundation event but then I found this

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:45,609
on the website that says much of the

00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:48,250
Foundation's extensive work is done in

00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:51,549
the background yet is critical to

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,030
ongoing functioning and growth of the

00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:56,590
OpenStreetMap project so that

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,900
OpenStreetMap project is kind of beyond

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:04,359
the foundation it's many things that

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:06,609
OpenStreetMap is and so you can anyone

00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:12,280
can become a member of OpenStreetMap

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:15,880
foundation go to the the website and and

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,709
sign up talk to Dorothea who's been

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:29,260
Manning our foundation table outside and

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:31,540
say ok and yeah so become a member but

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,350
you don't just have to support it

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:39,880
through that membership which you know I

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:42,220
think it's only 5 pounds a year but

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,860
there are working groups and these are

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,800
kind of doing that extensive work to

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,850
support the pod

00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,830
in different ways and we've collected

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:55,250
information about the working groups

00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,590
anyone can join them although it's good

00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,660
to be a member of the foundation because

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,050
it's good to support that you do not

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,510
have to be a member of the foundation to

00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,660
contact a working group to ask them how

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,910
you can help you did not even have to be

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,660
a member to help them they I'm sure will

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:18,500
be very interested if you can help them

00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:21,530
and before this conference we asked each

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,500
of the groups kind of what are the tasks

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:29,060
of your your working group what is it

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:32,480
that you do we kind of asked what the

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,810
required skills although these are

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,430
skills that you may learn as you if you

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,770
join a working group and start

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,990
supporting them and helping them you

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:45,560
know how do we get skills we get them by

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,780
learning and doing and helping them and

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,290
we also ask the working groups

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,970
particularly what is the help needed a

00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:57,770
lot of them just want more people

00:04:52,970 --> 00:05:00,140
because these things take time but there

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,570
are some things where their group is is

00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:08,050
lacking maybe in specialist skills maybe

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:10,669
in just certain situations and if you've

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:14,540
yeah if you've got those skills you've

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:17,120
been added help if you don't think you

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,190
can help still find the working group

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,280
you're interested in or working groups

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:25,370
plural and talk to them and say can I

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,980
learn this or or you know can i still be

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:31,430
helpful because they'll be grateful for

00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,169
you asking those questions so I'm going

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,660
to go through the working groups and

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:38,690
explain them this session is going to be

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,760
a bit interactive so if people are still

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,960
watching on YouTube sorry you won't be

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,320
able to move around the room

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,210
and but you can contact these working

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,460
groups by going to the OpenStreetMap

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:55,550
foundation so we start with the

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:58,039
communications working group so they do

00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,760
love work representing OpenStreetMap on

00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,480
on

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,090
from communication mediums which there

00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,830
are many in our world now so there's the

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,050
OpenStreetMap twitter account

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,210
there's the Facebook group there's the

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,220
OpenStreetMap blog where they've written

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,220
a lot of things and and posted a lot of

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:19,010
things there's the foundation website

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,360
where they talk about OpenStreetMap they

00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:26,300
kind of do moderation on mailing lists

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,640
there's it varies what they're doing and

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,050
how much and I'm probably going to miss

00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,340
things because think sometimes they do

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,370
some work on the wiki and and things

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,020
like that if it's kind of talking about

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,360
OpenStreetMap or what open shoot Maps

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,600
doing it's probably either something the

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,670
communications working group does or

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:52,300
they could they could do so their skills

00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,080
there of course writing skills

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,300
translation because if you want to

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,690
communicate you want to communicate to

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,210
more people so if you can translate or

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:06,140
you know just writing in your native

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:10,280
language then that can help and skills

00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:12,710
would design and art skills are good too

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,990
you know it's not just writing isn't the

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,850
only form of communication visualizing

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,180
this so you might just have one of those

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:22,910
skills and they have a lot of single

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,740
tasks so you know it's just take a task

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,900
and you can do it and then you're done

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,510
and then pick another one they've got

00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,350
work that kind of needs more regular

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:34,490
ongoing people to keep momentum going

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,020
and I think generally they're just

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,390
looking for lots of help anyway so

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,790
whether you want to just do a bit at a

00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:45,430
time they'll have things for you or if

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:48,220
you can commit regular time each week

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,870
the state of the map committee of course

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:55,340
organizes this international event that

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:57,650
you're at and but we're also working a

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,040
lot more there's a lot of regional state

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,320
of the maps and the aren't run by the

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,720
foundation but we want to support them

00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,720
so that's kind of sharing our knowledge

00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,160
of how to plan and organize and run a

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,040
good

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,100
forint it's sometimes arranging dates so

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,600
that you know so that these regional

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,870
conferences don't clash with the

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,360
international one or or things like that

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:25,540
and there's lots of different tasks we

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,990
do love researching things like the

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,390
caterers what caterers are in Milan who

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,169
can produce print a booklet you know can

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:37,510
you get quotes we do love helping the

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:41,110
delegates in in various ways with their

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,780
queries and also as a lot of love our

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,910
time goes into kind of helping the

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,490
scholars with these are applications and

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,620
things like that I'm not sure I quite

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,470
listed everything there because I've

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:57,220
been busy organizing the conference the

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:59,350
workload is very seasoned also the last

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,100
few weeks it's got very busy and we

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,110
could have done one more help it's now

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,220
going to hopefully calm down for a bit

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,680
and I'll get some sleep

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,720
but in a few months we'll be planning

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,930
the 2019 conference so we'd love some

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,250
help with that we'll be announcing where

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,380
that is at the end of the year but

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:22,330
there's lots of work we can do remotely

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:26,890
for that on the planning and budgeting

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:31,510
and also they'll be accepting the talk

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:35,460
committee kind of we help with that say

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:38,740
there's the operations working group so

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:41,920
they wanted to make it quickly they you

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,080
don't have to be a system admin to be

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,490
part of this working group they kind of

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:52,300
focus a lot on on the planning of that

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:56,380
and say the the purchasing of servers

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,510
that run the different services and and

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:02,230
that kind of goes into their required

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:04,540
skills on they need to do love analyzing

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,330
and forecasting you know are we going to

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,910
need another server because our traffic

00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:13,930
is increasing more visits or or you know

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:17,800
the servers are getting older will they

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,990
need replacing and Linux or technical

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,960
knowledge is helpful if you understand

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,800
that but yeah it's not essential

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:30,550
like many of these working groups it's

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:33,130
it's kind of yeah if you've gone

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:36,580
interest in how servers run how they're

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:39,459
planned then you can kind of talk to

00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,570
these people so so I guess you know they

00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:43,209
probably need to love help with

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,279
administrative tasks and that kind of

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:48,250
just organizing their plans and also

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,020
their group and I think they're looking

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,709
for people to help we're drawing up the

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:55,600
budgets and kind of understanding how

00:10:53,709 --> 00:11:00,130
much they need to spend or how much they

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:03,160
can spend the membership working group

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,240
so they if you remember of the

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,310
foundation

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,220
you might contact the foundation with a

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:11,050
query particularly if your payment

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,450
hasn't gone through and and so could

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,120
think they get a lot of small messages

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,040
of oh this isn't quite right individual

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,100
things that they're helping answering

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,779
questions and supporting those members

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,020
so that hopefully will get more

00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:29,470
foundation members and it will will be

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:32,459
strong in in what it does in supporting

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:38,610
the project they have a regular meetings

00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:43,300
and they use a CRM custom customer

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,800
relationship manager thank you and so if

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,470
you've got experience with that it's a

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,860
bonus but as I say that that's a skill

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:53,860
you can learn by using that but having a

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,320
customer service mindset of you know

00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,890
helping people learn and being kind and

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,550
and yeah kind of polite to get back to

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:06,400
people so that the CRM they use is

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:09,130
called savvy CRM if you have technical

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:13,690
knowledge of that I think you will be an

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:16,630
extra bonus to them right now but if you

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:20,140
have the ability to be a computer and

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,880
respond frequently that would also be

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,620
helpful because it it would take

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,220
pressure off other people who have to be

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,899
the ones to respond nobody wants to be a

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,329
member and send a message and you had to

00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:36,570
wait till that one person deem the job

00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:36,570
is is next on line and and has some time

00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:44,010
the data working groups they work to

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:48,760
kind of resolve the disputes of of data

00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:51,730
and also detect and stop any kind of

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,800
data vandalism or issues so some of that

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:57,460
happens in the community without the

00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:01,030
data working group being involved but

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:04,420
they can kind of help resolve this the

00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:07,540
kind of disputes and and kind of work

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,690
with parties that may be a need needs to

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,940
make sure help but they also work on

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,430
setting the policy on what those rules

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:22,260
are to the community what should people

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:25,720
do to make a good OpenStreetMap database

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,550
so there's some probably obvious skills

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,530
if if you've done some mapping it's

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,530
that's good if you've got experience

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,270
because then you can you know what it's

00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:37,210
like to be editing the map and

00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:41,050
understanding that of course trying to

00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:43,420
stay neutral or impartial is good when

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,000
you're you know you that they need to

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:50,290
hear both sides or multiple sides of the

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,180
argument and it says constructed a I

00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,940
think that's constructive and a feedback

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,730
and help you know actually support

00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:00,280
people can can you encourage them to how

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,280
can they be good what is good about what

00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:06,610
they're doing and the help that that

00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,850
they would benefit from is from very

00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:14,310
geographic areas and I think that's down

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:17,050
to it helps to have local knowledge and

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:21,240
and people in the cultures where these

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,240
situations might happen

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,230
there's the engineering working group so

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,570
these are cutlasses kind of the

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,930
development and programming of some of

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:35,050
the systems in the foundation so they

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:37,180
they are possibly one of the ones of

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,720
managing some of the lists so there's

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:43,540
the the top 10 tasks which I believe now

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,810
has nine tasks as someone finally

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,820
completed one there's a google Summer of

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,790
Code which supports people in those

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,580
projects listed there and and these

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,870
required skills I put down rails

00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,060
programming I know there's other

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:01,120
languages that can be used depending on

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:04,540
what you're working on so if you do any

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,970
programming this is one that I think you

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,090
you maybe need a bit of that skill

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:13,570
already or or you need to to be ready to

00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:15,430
learn it on your own but to meet the

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:20,890
engineering working group and and talk

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:23,050
to them but these tasks are very much

00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:26,640
you can kind of see if you can help with

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:31,110
that you can can go ahead and do it and

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:35,170
and it's waiting for you the licensing

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:38,110
working group and so there that's me

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:41,410
that involves matters that relate to the

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:44,530
OpenStreetMap beta where it's being used

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:47,980
in other places if it's if it's abiding

00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:52,330
by the license but also third-party data

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:55,450
which is yeah I'm not I think that's a

00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:59,130
bit of both of is some of our data going

00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:01,170
into third-party illegally is

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,960
third-party data coming into

00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:08,140
OpenStreetMap against rules and that's

00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,520
our thing aside from the data they also

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:14,350
work with the trademarks such as the

00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,920
OpenStreetMap logo and the state of the

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:22,270
map logo are they being used under the

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,330
rules and the policies to represent the

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:29,140
awesome map that we have and other legal

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:32,790
policies around that that that kind of

00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:35,350
help in a world where that's important

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:38,950
so if you've got an interest in legal

00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:41,860
matters that's of course helpful also

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:44,530
detail orientated it can involve looking

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,690
at a lot of small print or figuring out

00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:51,040
small print and getting this written

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:55,510
well and so I think they hope help

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:58,300
needed is is varied say community

00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:00,970
members without self corporate or

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,620
international ties can help it doesn't

00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:06,870
exclude you from the working group but

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:10,410
it can help to to kind of have a

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:13,900
separate view and a conversation on this

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:16,990
but they particularly like a lot of

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:21,130
those I deal with in Europe and they'd

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:24,610
if anyone happens to or you know how is

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:27,100
a legal expert maybe you're a student in

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,720
law or or or something like that

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,240
you know if you've if you've got that

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,700
knowledge that would be a bonus because

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:42,760
I know that's particularly specialist

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:46,440
but yeah so another part of the

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:49,420
foundation is the board of directors and

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,730
so the board of directors kind of

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,310
actively support and further the

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,830
interests of the foundation they kind of

00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:59,860
oversee those working groups and it's

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:02,680
free the working groups the kind of a

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,240
lot of the work gets done but the the

00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,510
board of directors so they're

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,150
responsible for the foundation and

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:13,300
that's down to a legal kind of level as

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:17,290
well so so they've got to love admin and

00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:21,100
finance but also organizational planning

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:24,280
of that are the working groups meeting

00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,470
their tasks are do we have the right

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,650
working groups that we need to do what

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:32,320
the foundation wants to do but also this

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,360
this kind of admin of arranging their

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,700
board meetings making sure they at least

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,370
know what's happening and the finance

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,250
you know there's money from sponsors

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,590
there's money for this conference and

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,490
money for the servers and you've got to

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:50,820
plan that and understand account

00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,900
accounting and and kind of finance thing

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,380
so of course being on the board of

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,280
directors past experience of

00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,870
OpenStreetMap and OpenStreetMap

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,160
foundation is it's really helpful

00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:06,520
enables you to oversee the working

00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,580
groups and and I think all but one of

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,480
the the board are on at least one

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:16,310
working group

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,970
or that kinda links min so to be a board

00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:21,170
of the director you've you do that's the

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:25,550
one you do have to be a foundation

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:29,390
member for and you can run for elections

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:32,300
in December December rich they should

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:36,110
happen there's normally a few spaces

00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:40,970
each year and you'll be elected by the

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:43,970
other members say the Board of Directors

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:46,970
is the only one that these in fact

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,710
actually most of the board are at this

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,610
conference can you wave your hand if

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:55,430
you're on the Foundation board so we got

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,380
Kate have a ball and Frederick so you

00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,450
can find them at the conference and talk

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,640
to them but for this session I'm gonna

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,190
get you to talk to the working groups

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,600
because I think that's a great way to

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:09,920
start your involvement if you're not

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:13,340
already involved and you know but but

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,770
thank you to our directors we take up

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:20,060
this responsibility and and get involved

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:24,590
in the working groups so this is the

00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:26,990
interactive part now I've already asked

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,060
some people and hopefully they should

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,980
know hopefully they they know what

00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:34,070
working group they're involved to

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,530
actually be available here if you look

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:39,230
around the room I've put some signs up

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:42,770
and thankfully they kind of meet this

00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:45,400
slide so communications working group is

00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:49,610
going to be in this corner at the front

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,640
states of the map committee operations

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:54,230
working group is kind of to the back

00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,610
membership work no that's the data

00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:01,100
working group membership data working

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,870
group read the signs and the two on the

00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,360
right I thought it might get busy in

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:07,340
here so I've kind of put their signs

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,800
should be outside I didn't put them

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,650
marketed but you find engineering

00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,390
working group in by that door and the

00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:19,220
licensing working group outside that

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:21,770
door so stand on your feet find a

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:26,230
working group the kind of in chess you

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,230
and go and speak to those people

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,300
reduce time thank you

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:50,500
so also as you go to these groups you
