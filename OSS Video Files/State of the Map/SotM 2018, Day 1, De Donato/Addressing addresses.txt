We are all used to describe locations with words. The concept is universally known as addresses. You put them on postcards and letters and expect that you find the right places on the map when you put them in the search box on openstreetmap.org. For a computer this can be surprisingly challenging because addresses can take many shapes and forms in different regions of the world. This talk looks into different address formats in the real world, the different ways addresses can be tagged in OSM and how they can be efficiently processed.

so hello welcome everybody so I'm a

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,360
long-term ever since ten years and all

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,240
probably better known by some of you by

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,610
Ellen BIA and also a software developer

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,449
and I want to talk about addresses and

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,770
osm today if I say addresses you

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,390
probably think about this kind of

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,180
address or the one you put on a letter

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,099
to all of us remember this or for the

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,830
younger of you the one you put in the

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,910
Amazon feed so you get to stuff

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,079
delivered and actually if you look it up

00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,730
merriam-webster greets a few so an

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,670
address is a place where a person can be

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,800
communicated with but actually it's not

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,960
exactly what I want to talk about what I

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,750
want to talk about it's more location

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,600
descriptions so any textual description

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,879
that can tell you where a geographical

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,309
location is so to give you an example

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,020
recently I found a map Erin Byrne who

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,699
had started to do exactly this kind of

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,340
thing so this is in German but it

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,050
basically says this fountain is on the

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,290
west side of the building hopping good

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,580
in both matches 50 in Bern so this is

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,729
the kind of location description we are

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,159
talking about now you can argue if you

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,850
want to put this in osm but it's clear

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,430
that this kind of thing is useful so my

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,830
personal motivation on this I'm actually

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,409
the developer of the search engine that

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,680
is behind the search box on the awesome

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,150
main site no me not him and then you

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,490
need this textual description and two

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,530
phones so once you put it in so we have

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,750
to understand it but what's more

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,790
important today it is when you get your

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,040
results back you get this list of

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,380
results which is actually actually a

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,140
location description and people have

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,909
complaining about it that's there's too

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,500
much in it there's too little in it or

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,180
it's plain wrong and actually there

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,880
right so I wasn't wanted to look into

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,920
how to make this better and I'm going to

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,149
present today my findings about the

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,399
awesome data what we can use so first

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,750
thing generally what people say why

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,509
don't you just put my postal address

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,119
there and they kind of at a point it's

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,310
not as easy as it sounds as always but

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,379
as I have a point let's look into why

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,150
post address are actually so good about

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,819
this

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,470
so one of the things is postal address

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,930
have been invented before computers and

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,580
that means they're really for humans and

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,860
that's one what we want to have now here

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,349
if you have computers just give them

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:28,280
according coordinate don't translate it

00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:29,810
in three words that's stupid just we

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,549
wanted something humans can understand

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,769
and there's a couple of things which are

00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:35,599
important there the first is you should

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,060
use well a non point of reference so

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,560
people know what the city names are or

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,269
the street names are and if you don't

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,760
know them they're even science up there

00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:44,629
where you can look at them and confirm

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,900
that you're actually at the right

00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:51,109
location the second thing is there's

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,489
always a hierarchical structure so the

00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:55,010
standard address goes something like

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,870
this you have a country a city a street

00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,239
and house number and this is good

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,010
because depending on how well people

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,519
know the location they always can kind

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,650
of locate the object so in this case I

00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,209
don't know long beach but if this

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,040
address is presented to me I know where

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,890
California is which already helps that

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,340
no it's not an address in Germany so

00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:23,180
this is also what you want the other

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:25,010
thing is I know where postal addresses

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,250
exist they have a good coverage so you

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,359
have one generally for each building but

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,980
this is actually where the problem

00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:32,510
starts if you want to use postal

00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,609
addresses as a location description

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,400
because they're only there where there

00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:39,530
are people so you don't have addresses

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,560
say for a monument unless you in

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,819
Switzerland I think they have them there

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,669
you don't have them in uninhabited

00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,629
places for mountains or something and of

00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:50,840
course you have to live in a country

00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:54,440
where they have invented or come up with

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,449
a postal address system and that's

00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,780
actually not too many of them it's quite

00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:02,269
difficult to figure out how many exactly

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,690
so let's have a look at Horsham instead

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,790
and see what we have so if we start with

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:10,669
the postal addresses the tech you use

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,650
here are the address techs there are

00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:15,669
quite a lot of them we get to this in a

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,889
second but let's first of all look into

00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:20,780
what's the coverages at the moment so

00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,940
what I did is I looked at

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,790
all the objects in osm which had some

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,680
kind of address tag and looked what how

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,500
many addresses they are per inhabitant

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,240
in each country and that's what I came

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,100
up with so what you can see is the

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,080
winner in this category is the

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,390
Netherlands which actually have an

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,170
address for less than two people so I

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:44,090
don't know what they're doing and other

00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,250
days other than this you see there are a

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,410
few imports where coverage costs might

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:52,520
well if you go to the south of the earth

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:55,760
coverage gets less and less so yes

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,380
that's a good place to start with but we

00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,200
suddenly will need something else and

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,620
address texts to actually generate our

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,900
location description so if you look a

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,850
little bit more into the address text so

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:12,200
as you can see there about 84 million

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,730
address objects in total and if you

00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,320
start from the lowest level of Allah

00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,040
dress that would of course be the house

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,920
number and actually 80 million of these

00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,680
objects have a house number and there is

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,360
no other tag which describes anything

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,560
else on this on the lowest level let's

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,610
say there is a little bit of a dress

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,340
house name most notably in Great Britain

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:37,040
in the rural areas but apart from this

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:40,070
there's not much else so I guess a house

00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,990
numbers a really good base to have I've

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,000
added a couple of other things here I

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,100
was constructing conscription numbers

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,690
and street numbers so the Austrians will

00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,540
probably know this but they generally

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,400
are added in addition I'm not going to

00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,760
say anything about interpolations that's

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,920
the next talk for you and there's also

00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,020
some attempts at flats and units which

00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,150
apparently are part of some postal

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,730
addresses in some countries but there's

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,490
not that much coverage there so address

00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,440
house numbers good next question is what

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,290
does the address house number refer to

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,600
and there you find two Tech's at the

00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,720
moment so at row Street that's your

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,700
average sized street address which

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,130
apparently most of the country says you

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,520
have 70 million and a couple of years

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:29,300
ago people started to use address place

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,250
which is for villages for example which

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,750
don't really name the house numbers

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,180
after

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,720
sing the streets but say we have one

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:40,480
size fits all for the UN entire village

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,120
so for those we have 7.4 million and

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,860
again looking into the database I

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,620
couldn't find much other things so it

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:52,150
seems that these two addressing systems

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,770
are enough to cover all usages in the

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,300
world maybe they aren't because people

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,600
who don't fit in there just haven't met

00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,970
it I don't know one thing I found when

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,930
actually looking into the wiki is this

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,940
Japan has its own addressing system it's

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,950
it's really it has really nice pictures

00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,410
so it is a block based system where I

00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:14,380
gave off from block to quarter in your

00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,940
city to city and so on and fortunately

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,070
it's all in Japanese so it's really hard

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,080
to implement so if you have your own

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,240
addressing system in your country please

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,280
and send it to English so other people

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,440
can use it if you then go for app if you

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,540
have to tweet now it actually gets

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,240
really messing with the address text so

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,669
you see here this is a little bit scaled

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,030
with the number of texture we have you

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:42,910
find city quite a lot also country which

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,010
is only marginally of use but if hard

00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,470
from this there are lots of texts in use

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,240
and it's not really clear what the

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,229
hierarchy here is and this is a problem

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,090
if you want to have a location

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:56,290
description you want to sort your

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:58,930
address text and we don't have any form

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:02,229
in our individual anywhere which says

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,270
what the hierarchy should be okay so

00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:06,669
what else do we do if the address texts

00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:10,060
are not enough next thing to like look

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:11,650
at our administrative boundaries so they

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,600
are nice because they have this admin

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,790
level tag which actually has a number

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,260
from 1 to 11 so you have your higher

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:23,350
higher here but the question is what's

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,729
the coverage again I've made a little

00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:31,870
map so country coverage is totally fine

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:34,479
so this is the map for levels 3 2 4 3 &

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,250
4 as are up to 4 so this should roughly

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,260
be state level and you see coverage is

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,539
really nice so this is something you can

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,789
totally use up to level 4 just use this

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,930
and be done with it if you go further

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,899
down until

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:49,240
six which should be county-level about

00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:51,610
it gets a little bit more patchy but

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,190
it's actually not too bad so Africa is

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:58,180
missing and the uninhabited areas of

00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:01,060
Australia and Canada but it's still

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,790
quite good if you go further down to

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:07,089
city level it really now it gets to show

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,890
that the most Europe is complete

00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:12,040
otherwise it looks a little bit worse

00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:15,310
and if you go further down to 11 which

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,950
is suburb level then yeah there's mostly

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:20,830
nothing and actually if you zoom even in

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,860
into Europe this is interesting because

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,899
you see it's not uniform for the for the

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,820
countries so you can't even say oh for

00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,860
this country I have level 1 to 6 and

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:34,180
they mean this and this apparently there

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:36,790
is still some discrepancy what you see

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,070
in Germany here especially is there is a

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:42,220
difference between how rural areas work

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:44,140
and urban areas and this is actually

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,400
something we haven't really covered in

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:54,850
our in our tagging but it's important to

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:57,400
know so also administrative areas are

00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,790
not always nice to work with I give you

00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,470
two examples one is the u.s. so city

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,560
boundaries in the US are always fun to

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:08,260
look at so they are basically completely

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,570
pull the poles and of course after this

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,880
little hole there and in a city you

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,339
still want to say that things within

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,620
this hole and wryly us and you don't

00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:19,959
want to say oh that's outside and just

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,839
the canteen so I have no idea what here

00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,000
administration is doing there but this

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,720
is this is one of the problem and it

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,310
gets even worse in rural us where you

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,589
generally have a little town which

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:35,470
really has the admin main administrative

00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:36,970
boundaries for the town and the postal

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,040
cities so everything that belongs to the

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,380
town and in terms of postal address is

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,770
much much larger and we haven't met any

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:48,459
of this another example is actually

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:50,170
Germany which you would think works

00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:52,839
better but it has these interesting

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:57,040
things all these yellow dots you see

00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,990
here so-called city counties if it's

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,910
so basically because it's a bigger city

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,070
we don't have County and then city

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,590
levels but we just lead one out and we

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,630
just left the county and for Berlin and

00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,280
Hamburg it's even worse all your state

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,790
level and that's all you get that's also

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,280
your city boundary and this is

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:18,820
problematic because you really need to

00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,740
know what each admin level corresponds

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,540
to we get to this in a second because we

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,190
have these things at the address text

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,380
where you say address county address

00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,570
city and so on and if you want to

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,940
actually make a correspondence with this

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,380
then you're on trouble if admin levels

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,380
means something different in the same

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:39,520
country okay so this is the

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:42,430
administrative levels then oh yeah I've

00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,010
got one thing which is the mappers the

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,170
other problem of admin Levites is they

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,570
have added a lot of admin boundaries now

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,000
just to give you two examples France has

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,620
added another level to distinguish

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,840
between France mainland and France

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,760
overseas which might be interesting to

00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,850
shown your location description but

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,710
maybe not and another example in Germany

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,080
there is a level for so called state

00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,760
district border which I I'm from Germany

00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,060
but still only learned about that this

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,950
exists because I looked in OSM so you

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,490
really would never ever show this it

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,950
just confuses people okay so this was

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,080
the administrative boundaries if you

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,830
don't have them the next thing you have

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,420
to resort to a place notes and place not

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:29,790
so difficult because of course there it

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:32,080
gets a bit squishy you what plays note

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,820
location actually belongs to you

00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,030
basically have to go to okay if it's the

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:40,000
closest one then I take it so place not

00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:43,360
actually not nice if you can make a map

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,120
an area for your place if you look at

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,920
here I look like Vicky what exists

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,530
because again in the database it's not

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,450
very clear so as I already said country

00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,800
state region we can forget about this

00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,990
because we have the admin boundaries

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,870
which are perfect well almost

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:01,390
so question is what to do with the

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,520
county plays notes if you look at the

00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:06,130
distribution there are some countries

00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,319
I'm actually quite extensive

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,209
but if you now just gray out all the

00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:13,209
countries where we have realized okay we

00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:15,180
have admin boundaries there already so

00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:19,029
there's a couple that are left over

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:22,540
notice Lee I think new GUI Nia this is

00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:24,100
in Pakistan so you really want to

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,410
probably include this for countries

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,410
which don't have the admin boundaries

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,720
and this is still quite clear where to

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,389
put it and then we get to the other

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,870
place values and there we have the same

00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:39,310
and that I already mentioned with

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:42,069
address text so there's a lot of

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,050
different values it's in the Miki

00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:47,730
already distinguishing a little bit

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:53,410
between urban places and rural places

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:55,540
but not really that well and the problem

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,360
is that people are using the hierarchies

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,970
here in a very different ways so if you

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,709
take place Hamlet which is probably one

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,600
of the most notorious one this may be

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:07,810
its own incorporated place which you

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,850
want to show or it may be just a part of

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,250
a village because to village has just

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,500
fuse together and then you really don't

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,769
know what to do with it another example

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,569
is if you have this big city so you have

00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:21,819
a lot of boroughs which are mapped as

00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:23,560
place nodes but there is the inner city

00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,300
which is not mapped as a borrow because

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,199
it's a city itself there's only the

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:31,149
place city and one doesn't know that

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,339
this actually is at the same level or

00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:35,589
should be or not really is because it's

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:38,829
the city is the whole thing but at the

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:42,329
same time it's a borough and we don't

00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:44,769
really have any classification for this

00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:48,660
so that's the current state of the

00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:51,970
database so what do we do with this data

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,529
so here's my proposal for an algorithm

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,500
but you want to do if you want to have

00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:59,290
your location data so first of all look

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,449
at the address Tex look what there are

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,980
sort them appropriately and then check

00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:04,899
if for the country you are in

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,449
you have everything you want if you have

00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:09,009
that's fine you're done if you haven't

00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:12,449
then look at the administrative

00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:15,160
boundaries again sorting by admin level

00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:17,870
move remove the ones which nobody knows

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,050
about the other ones you should

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:24,080
also again classified by countries the

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:26,210
superb and so on and then again you have

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,920
a list which you may or may not use if

00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,230
you if everything is in there then

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,410
you're done again if this still doesn't

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:36,650
work you still you have to look at the

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,120
place notes where again you have to

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,620
remove everything you already it's

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,610
already covered with your admin

00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:45,589
boundaries and then sort somehow do many

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,520
ones and just use the closest on your

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:52,460
find and hopefully you get a nice

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:55,330
address out of this so and as I said

00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,529
this is the theory in practice

00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,230
everything that's right here is still a

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:02,089
problem so I don't know how to sort

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,860
address Tex I don't know what he

00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:06,710
expected parts in an address for a

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,620
country actually are we don't know what

00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:12,740
the well-known are less known levels for

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:15,950
admin levels are for each country or

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,860
what type they have and finally we don't

00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:21,940
know how to solve the notes so you as a

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,620
mapper there's two things you can do

00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,410
first first of all for taking the

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,940
addresses if you want to do this so

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:31,700
here's my recommendation first always

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:34,670
add something like house number or house

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:37,490
name if this is your the case in your

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,320
area always at the address Street or at

00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,980
a place tag please don't that both that

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,600
doesn't make sense

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,740
either your house number belongs to a

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,180
street or it doesn't and then if you

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,510
want to hit the rest of the address

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:53,330
please do so but be aware that this is

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:56,480
not a Nissen tech so please only add the

00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:58,790
address techs which are really part of

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,420
your postal address that makes it any

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:04,400
easier to process the address and if all

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,650
these artists X are just compared

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,260
explained don't fit then please invent

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:13,579
new ones but don't forget to document it

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:15,500
in a wiki so somebody can find it and if

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,720
you want to go further than this then

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,230
I'd really appreciate some help in

00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:24,860
making sense of the different text I

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:27,770
just presented so the most important

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,530
thing is we somehow need a relationship

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:33,200
between admin levels place nodes

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,020
address Tech's need to put them in a

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,010
hierarchy and need to say which ones are

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:42,230
important or not so it would be really

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,230
really nice if you have some system

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,880
which works all over the world of course

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,250
there have been some attempt for example

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,270
for into place notes to add an admin

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,220
letter there which might not be bad but

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,840
looking at the data I suspect that we

00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,850
can do this only per country because the

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,580
countries are just too different in

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:04,420
their characteristics but even having

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,710
this per country would be a nice start

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:09,110
so to give you an example when looking

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,930
at this Japanese example I gave before I

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,940
also found this little spreadsheet here

00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:16,220
where they had done exactly what I was

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,470
looking for so it's a little bit small I

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,660
expositor eyes but what they did is

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,730
actually say ok these are the levels we

00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,560
have in our country use this for the

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,290
admin level use this for the place and

00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,970
use this for the address and they do

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:34,610
this actually for all three addressing

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:36,590
system they have been in Japan so I'm

00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,270
not sure yet hard to do this but we

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,310
should get to a system where we have

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,710
this for every country and this would

00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:46,250
really make it easier for data consumers

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:48,410
like Nomi natum to really make sense of

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:53,270
the data and to improve the search

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:54,800
results you see in nominative so that's

00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:59,480
that's it for me

00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:02,120
so please if you just said oh but we in

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,940
our country already have this all sorted

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,190
out come to me talk to me and tell me

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,990
about it or also if you come from a

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,610
country where you have an addressing

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,680
system which nobody knows about and

00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,170
which doesn't fit in any level I'd like

00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:19,270
to hear about this too and see where we

00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,270
can get from there thank you

00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:32,880
so thank you for this interesting

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:35,540
presentation at their questions yes sir

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,250
hello it is nominal team supports

00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:40,020
machine-readable rules and how one

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:44,580
country has its addresses and how

00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:46,590
another has it doesn't yet but the plan

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,300
is to have something like this the

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,580
question is how to do it so that's why

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,590
I'm now trying to collect what cases we

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:57,410
actually have so we can actually write a

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,410
rule system which works for everybody

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,420
yes

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:10,200
you haven't mentioned postal codes which

00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,750
are a key part of addresses in many

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,090
country yes

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,590
that's deliberately because it's not

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,140
really that important for the location

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,720
description I was talking about and also

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,820
they actually don't fit my criteria of

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,559
human readable addresses because they're

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,429
not really useful in for finding

00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:31,950
something so this is a bit of a separate

00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:34,980
problem especially as there we don't

00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:38,340
have areas at all as well but basically

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,860
those we have to nominate most of us

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,049
process them completely apart from

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,510
everything else and yeah if you're

00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:47,070
interested I can later tell you a little

00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:57,240
bit about what it's doing I'm trying to

00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:59,280
do other questions so do you think it

00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,530
would work actually without hierarchies

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,500
so could you build a search engine

00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:07,260
without the hierarchies but instead of

00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,150
just naming the the place types as they

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:14,909
are named in a particular country such

00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:19,409
as a parish or a suburb ruff do you

00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:21,659
think it's doable it depends what you

00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:24,360
want to do so for finding things yes

00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:26,400
totally that's that's enough but not for

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,460
presenting you the results you don't

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,940
want to have list there if that country

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:35,070
is this status isn't this it wouldn't be

00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,350
readable at all but then it's only about

00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,970
the address formatting right and this

00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:43,350
yeah this is then mostly about that was

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:46,620
format so if you tell me okay this is

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,720
the parts of our address then that's

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,780
fine I can process something like this

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,340
but only having this information you

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,240
still need but if you if you know the

00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,450
parts putting them in order is pretty

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,360
simple well

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:04,760
assuming that they are hierarchical

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,190
order it okay yes that's true and I

00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,370
think that's a huge challenge across

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:13,490
geographies sometimes the hierarchy just

00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:17,560
isn't there well hopefully per country

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:24,500
but I don't know yeah you have to see

00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:27,290
okay one more question sorry excuse me

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,300
yeah yeah yeah actually do you propose

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,490
any international standard for their

00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,230
addressing system I mean for because F D

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,540
country's people write their address in

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:39,580
own way like for you Europeans and the

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:42,920
u.s. countries so can you hear me

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,050
no sorry can you I mean do you propose

00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,390
any international address system so that

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,850
people can follow that in their own

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:52,010
country like sub some in some country

00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,980
people right house number street number

00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:57,830
and zip code and country in some country

00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,710
like people right some nearby location I

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,810
mean like some identification point so

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:05,240
do you propose some Milton I mean some

00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:10,490
in standard to we follow for the a

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:13,270
distant system I'm not proposing to have

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:16,100
one size fits all for the whole for Yolo

00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,750
actually what I would prefer is that you

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,540
and your country come up with a system

00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,580
which kind of fits into our current

00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:27,380
addressing shameful scheme for example

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:29,990
and then we try to incorporate it the

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,150
whole we do have a funny year I think

00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,970
you're referring to just saying

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,980
something like three houses behind the

00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:40,310
church or something thank you

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,440
yeah that's so this one we have to

00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:45,220
address full tank for this but actually

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,950
I found it it's not very useful because

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,990
you never know what it refers to so if

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,890
you look at the values currently which I

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,660
use fact was false

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,730
sometimes people put too whole address

00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,890
including the country in there sometimes

00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,080
you really have just this part so I

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,610
think we need new probably a new tag for

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,730
this but this is one of the things yeah

00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:08,780
I think one of the addresses system we

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,660
don't do it all at the moment but yeah

00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,900
come up

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:21,780
good check and this can be incorporated

00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:24,280
okay thank you other questions yes hi

00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,990
kind of follow-up to that previous

00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,450
question is there some kind of data

00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,310
about businesses that you have so I

00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:33,160
could say like next to McDonald's for

00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:35,550
example that you know it women really

00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,320
human-readable

00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:41,380
yes this actually this is a little bit

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,990
of a different approach he would do

00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,150
which I'm not trying to do which goes in

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:48,430
direction of landmarking so you want to

00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:51,480
find interesting places in your city and

00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:54,220
then use them as a point of reference

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,470
but we don't have anything at all in the

00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:59,110
in the database I think at the moment to

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,210
mark them questions if you could kind of

00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,130
find them by analyzing the data but I

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,590
have a little bit of doubt but I'd

00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,870
really love to look that somebody looks

00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:09,700
into this kind of landmarking because

00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:12,340
this would also be for routing just

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,130
perfect so go left after McDonald's then

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:18,190
right after the old factory which was

00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:24,630
gone down in 1964 and this this would be

00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:28,080
nice okay so thank you sir again and

00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,080
