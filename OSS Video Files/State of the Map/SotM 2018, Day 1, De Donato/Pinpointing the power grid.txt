Over 1.2 billion people around the world lack access to electricity, most of them in rural areas of Sub Saharan Africa and Asia. An accurate map of infrastructure is critical to expand access to these people. Yet, the electricity network is often under-mapped and the schematics that do exist are not publicly available, or lack geospatial accuracy.

In this talk, we'll describe our work with the World Bank to map the grid network in OpenStreetMap in an efficient and repeatable manner. We developed an approach using machine learning to identify areas likely to contain high-voltage towers and used this information to speed up human mappers more than 10-fold. We will highlight this strategy of augmenting human effort with machine learning and provide perspective on how this workflow might be applied to other challenges facing the mapping community.

hi everybody my name is Sasha and I live

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,809
in Bangalore India and I work for a

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,929
company called development seed I don't

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,030
feel as I've heard about Dovan seed

00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:16,770
we're a pretty small team we mostly work

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,740
on Earth Observation and satellite

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,230
imagery data these days and work with a

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,330
pretty wide range of group of people on

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,820
some of the projects that we think are

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,590
pretty exciting and I'll quickly run you

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,289
through so over the last couple of years

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,329
we've kind of focused a lot on

00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:37,079
processing analyzing satellite imagery

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,940
and Earth Observation data sets one of

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,469
our recent projects has been kind of

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,700
predicting hurricane a summation

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:48,480
hurricane strength estimation with NASA

00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:50,399
we've been looking at changes in

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,180
satellite imagery over time and how that

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,360
relates to OS m and how can cities how

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,770
can data in cities be better we work

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,039
with the humanitarian street map team

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,680
recently to look at map completeness and

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,659
those are some projects and if you come

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,909
find me later we can talk further but

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,720
today I want to talk to you about one of

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,150
our recent projects with with wall bank

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,009
looking at mapping power grids in three

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,000
countries so we were looking at Pakistan

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,080
Nigeria and Zambia so when I say power

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,479
grids we're talking about the

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,659
conventional power distribution network

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,909
so kind of looks like this very standard

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:34,049
pylons you will see when you're driving

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,020
outside your city the reason why it's

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,119
important to look at the power grid is

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,460
because I don't show like you've all

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,979
pretty read up about the sustainable

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,240
development goals and one of the most

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,950
important things that the World Bank

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,329
calls out in their state of electricity

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,460
access report is that access to

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,219
electricity kind of touches on many

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,560
other sustainable demand goals that has

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,869
impact on health education food security

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,479
poverty eradication gender equality and

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:09,119
things like that and most of the time

00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:11,450
when people when researchers do sort of

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,790
estimation of how fast

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,459
electricity demands can be met over the

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,769
over the course of many years over the

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:21,680
course of the estimated increase in

00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:25,400
population it's not looking that great

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,470
so for instance even by 2030 sub-saharan

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,660
Africa is not going to be able to meet

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,690
their electricity demands because of the

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,250
growth in population now the tricky

00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,170
situation here is that most of these

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,180
data sets about how the distribution

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,549
happens where are the existing areas

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,379
that have distribution our kind of look

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:45,069
kind of looks like this so it's either

00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:47,870
owned completely by private entities or

00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:50,209
you know have maps like this that are

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,540
stored in offices which never see the

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:55,730
light of the day and it's quite hard to

00:02:53,540 --> 00:03:00,079
do this kind of analysis so this is a

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:02,030
Zambia it's pretty intricate map of the

00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,500
distribution but it's really hard to

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,329
kind of run analysis on top of this

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,079
unless you do a lot of geo referencing

00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:11,780
and things OpenStreetMap does a

00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:12,920
reasonably good job of actually there

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,840
are some people who actually like

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,090
mapping these things so there are over

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,400
10 million nodes that are tagged as

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:24,650
pylons which is power equals power

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,600
so just like you know most of our work

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,660
we wanted to map this in OpenStreetMap

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:33,049
to do more geography based distribution

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,900
and research like that there is a

00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:39,500
problem so this is somewhere central

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:44,180
Pakistan there is a pylon in this image

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:50,430
and this is about zoom 13 so not so far

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:56,510
away but can anyone see right

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:58,980
it's somewhere over there but zoom in

00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:04,349
kind of can you see it's like this is

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:07,680
zoomed like 16 so these things are

00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:11,489
really hard to see and this is we're

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:17,130
talking about like Pakistan this is

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:18,660
mostly desert like desert desert and you

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,820
know there's not many other features

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,090
around this area and it's still very

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,860
hard to see these things some more

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,919
examples and these are further down so

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,990
this is like zoom 16 zoom 17 and it's

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,720
still kind of pretty hard to see and

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,190
some of these if you go into mapping

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,150
these features it could be very

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:42,210
time-consuming now let's kind of look at

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,830
the scale in the country so most of the

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,449
time if you want to map these kind of

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,330
high resolution features you would want

00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:51,270
to zoom your editor down to zoom 18 and

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:54,479
ID only lets you start mapping at zoom

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,190
16 for instance right so if you want to

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,690
map all of the power girl and Pakistan

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,530
you'll be kind of looking through over

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:05,780
50 million tiles for Nigeria about 40

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:13,349
million and for Zambia about 34 million

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:14,940
that's quite a bit of work so we've

00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:18,750
we've really been interested in sort of

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,820
looking at how we can help map faster

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,090
and OpenStreetMap and not to necessarily

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,909
replace the people at openstreetmap

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,320
or the mappers in OpenStreetMap and this

00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,940
would get I mean I know that this has

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,400
been a slightly political topic over the

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,500
last many months people have tried many

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,120
things with you know all gone through

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,250
processes of figuring out what best

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,320
practices are there but I think it's

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,539
still very well established that humans

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,669
do a better job in actual mapping in

00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:49,080
OpenStreetMap and machines at the moment

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:50,789
this could change but right now it's

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,240
still a better way to help people look

00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:53,580
at the map

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,960
and edit and make changes right and we

00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,840
have had instances where things have

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:03,960
been not so good we've talked about

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,660
artificial intelligence and we've talked

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,990
about how that could actually help

00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,360
OpenStreetMap and make people map faster

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,830
or we could fill up gaps in

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,560
OpenStreetMap much faster and things

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,310
like that and depends on what end of the

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,919
spectrum you are in terms of quality and

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:25,259
speed you could kind of disagree or

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,949
agree with me right so what we've been

00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,190
kind of advocating a lot is this concept

00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,780
called

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,270
intelligence augmentation which goes

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,669
very well and along with artificial

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,729
intelligence intelligence augmentation

00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:42,060
is essentially using machines to sort of

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:44,159
help human beings make decisions better

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,530
and not necessarily try to make machines

00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:48,300
compete with human beings and I'm not a

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,909
machine learning an engineer or don't

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,500
have any expertise in that space so you

00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:57,599
know you're welcome to debate so what we

00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,280
wanted to do so these features are

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,400
pretty hard to map they take a lot of

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,139
time they're also pretty you know you

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,940
could mess up the map a lot if you were

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:11,729
to let the machines map themselves so

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,820
what we wanted to do is to use machine

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:16,860
learning approach to find areas on the

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,229
map where there's a high probability of

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,449
these pylons that exist on solid venturi

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:23,849
and then we would identify them and then

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:27,770
let the human beings or the mappers look

00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:27,770
at and then trace them out

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,780
all right questions so far

00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:37,969
disagreements everybody with me okay

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:40,159
okay so we kind of started doing

00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:43,229
standard machine learning approach we

00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,340
went through thousands of images based

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,030
on the data that's already in

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,219
OpenStreetMap

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,490
looking at different parts of Pakistan

00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:53,250
and Nigeria and Zaire took out a lot of

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,530
training data set that kind of looks

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,279
like a lot of it looks like this right

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,330
just many map tiles many solid imagery

00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:06,849
tiles which has a pile

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:09,310
or more so we will this sort of model

00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:13,030
that's based on existing convolution

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:16,470
models monocle exception and so you can

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:20,909
see that little batch so first Pakistan

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:23,889
Zambia Nigeria and you can see like the

00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:25,960
the inset this image on the right kind

00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,550
of shows like what parts that we used as

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,500
the training dataset so you can see

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:34,899
those lines kind of connect the base

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:38,349
racial Network right we ran this model

00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:40,899
over many of those million tiles in all

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,240
these countries and we were able to come

00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,750
up with a set of tiles where there's a

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,579
potential there's a probability of

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,410
pylons that exist and this kind of

00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:52,680
brings down the amount of tiles that you

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:56,410
have to look at by human eyes

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,390
drastically so this is again central

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,570
Pakistan and I'm just browsing the map

00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:05,980
and you can see in the red squares

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:07,660
there's a pylon can you guys see that so

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,270
this was actually pretty interesting

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:15,510
except for there were a bunch problems

00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:18,310
so so this is kind of the prediction

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:21,670
across Pakistan so each black dot

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:25,480
represents one pylon or a tile with the

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:27,430
pylon now so you can see like on the the

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,470
the arrow on the left which is more kind

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,510
of Eastern you can see the lines kinda

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,270
show up really well right so it connects

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:38,170
the the dots connect the power grid but

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,270
more central more East more west more

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:43,839
Eastern you can see there's like a big

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,370
blob of like black dots that's mostly

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,360
because our training data sets weren't

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:51,699
exactly the best the same kind of

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,470
features the could be distributed across

00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:56,589
different terrain and could have

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,720
different signals based on what area

00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:02,019
you're looking at right and for us that

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,430
was like a big problem which meant that

00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,459
there were a lot of false positives like

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,190
this but it still got us to a good point

00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:11,670
where we could start mapping order

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:16,290
country so in the end we came up with

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:19,640
this data set of disk wires where we

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:22,200
think there are potentially Highlands

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,420
and then sort of like two of them into

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,390
task manager just like what we would do

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,620
when we wanted to do mapping so we

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,960
created a task manager job per country

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,270
added the prediction layer into task

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:41,130
managers we did we made very basic

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:43,950
modifications to task manager integrated

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,560
that sort of opened each of those tasks

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:50,640
in in Java and then went through each

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,440
tile and in the end which is kind of

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,910
like chase them out so this is

00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,400
essentially the tracing process where

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,340
where you're really kind of only looking

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,050
at the boxes where we think there is a

00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:08,370
pylon and then just sort of tracing them

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:10,140
out I think like the bigger point and I

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,120
don't want to get too technical into the

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,160
machine learning side or the chain

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,040
desserts and the diversity of the data

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,370
set which are all in itself kind of

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,440
separate talks and the point that I want

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,030
to kind of get across is that this was a

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,220
pretty good experiment where we were

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:31,470
able to do this kind of mapping in a

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,700
much much faster way and we did before

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,650
we started doing machine learning

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,220
approach we wanted to look at what we

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:41,130
benchmark this against and we were

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:45,660
actually quite amazed by this 33 times

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:50,250
per hour rate and I think I think we

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:52,680
were able to do to map large parts of

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,290
the electricity grid network in Pakistan

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:59,520
so this is about Stan in Nigeria and

00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:02,640
Zambia in sort of a very short period of

00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:06,030
time without having to you know get a

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:10,580
change of glasses or you know have to

00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:10,580
hire more people or not losing our minds

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,870
now think they're for us like there I

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,740
guess there are many lessons from this

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:24,400
and I think two of the big ones one is

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:27,250
that the diversity of the chain datasets

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,100
and that osm does a really good job and

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,920
or some has that amount of data set that

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,200
amount of data that you could actually

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,300
diversify how you would use your how you

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,270
would create your training deserts for

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,400
for machine learning algorithms and it's

00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,140
something that a lot of lot of people

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,360
and a lot of people in the OSM have been

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,340
advocating so you should definitely kind

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,670
of talk to them and figure out what kind

00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:55,960
best practices are and I guess like the

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,970
second big thing was we had to run this

00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:02,110
prediction over a many million tiles and

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:05,710
you know without kind of ending up with

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:07,450
like massive AWS bill so that was like

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,400
an interesting problem solved

00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,350
figuring out how to batch process these

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:18,340
tiles and from the infrastructure

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:21,250
standpoint yeah I'll stop here and sort

00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:26,950
of take questions or comments and

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:29,730
conversation if anybody's up for it yes

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,730
absolutely

00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:41,919
yeah totally great question so we had

00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:43,989
two people on the machine-learning side

00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,459
who were belaying the model looking at

00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,619
the changes looking at the

00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:51,039
infrastructure and we had a we have an

00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:52,409
eight people mapping team and it you

00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,419
know it just doesn't add up because

00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:57,069
these models exception is like a pretty

00:13:55,419 --> 00:14:00,189
popular machine learning approach it

00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:03,009
exists we needed the time that we needed

00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:05,939
to I think like between collecting

00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:08,559
training datasets training the model and

00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:10,209
preparing the prediction preparing the

00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,269
prediction was the most time consuming

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,909
for us because they needed to run over a

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,789
period of time on computers but it's

00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:20,409
still much faster than eight people

00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:25,079
spending months looking at each of these

00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:25,079
tiles and would be a lot more expensive

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:42,370
any other question sorry so you talked

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,160
about that you have a lot of false

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,680
positives in your data do you also know

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,920
about how many false negatives I'm there

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,030
yeah many powerless you made it mad miss

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:58,150
yeah so I wish I had I wish this uh

00:14:54,030 --> 00:15:01,650
maybe this Jeff still has some more so

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:06,370
there were false negatives especially in

00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:08,800
kind of where like some some sand dunes

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:13,320
got picked up because of the shadow that

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:16,240
looked like a pylon for instance they

00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,850
yeah and I think I think there were a

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,580
lot more false positives than their

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:24,430
negatives just because the way that

00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:28,830
Aryan kept changing and we just didn't

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,830
include such a diverse dataset

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:42,080
did you also make a distinction between

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:44,720
high voltage power lines and pylons and

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,750
lower voltage stuff because you could

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,510
obviously you can't see it from your

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:55,040
aerial images but maybe the where else

00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:57,380
is it was it verified with other day

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,330
that you had about these networks right

00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,250
so I think this is they started out as

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:04,010
becoming a high voltage power grid

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,470
mapping and then we also included

00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,510
substations and transformers in the end

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,790
so we could kind of figure out what's

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:13,100
high voltage in what's not so we did

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,720
that towards the end and not very

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,370
successful but you know it's really hard

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,650
to identify substations right so so the

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:25,430
data was finally included more or less

00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:27,020
totally and once you start mapping this

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,790
is where actually makes more interesting

00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,200
for people to map because then once you

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,110
start kind of drawing the grid together

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,270
you know that you know the terrain goes

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,220
you know how what you know what path it

00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,460
follows and all that it was pretty

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,460
exciting

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,539
[Music]

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,810
it seems at some point you come into

00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:53,400
conflict with the commercial providers

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,810
who are building these Power Networks

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,170
does anybody ever answer this because

00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:01,690
we're building a public version of what

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,280
somebody already made a drawing and a

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:07,720
map of for their business purposes

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,980
that's a pretty large OpenStreetMap

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,600
question I think I can imagine this

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,010
having many levels of conflict of

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,540
interests and potential liability but

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,040
these are actual things that you can see

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,700
and verify on the ground so I'm just

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:30,400
gonna use that or some card and be like

00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:32,830
it exists so wicked man are you one of

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:40,300
those people who we may have a potential

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:41,590
conflict with totally yeah is there a

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,420
point where somebody comes to you and

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,880
says you shouldn't be doing that that's

00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,370
our network or right now somebody else

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,950
comes to you and says we'll actually do

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,860
I've actually got a map in my pocket of

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,140
what we do last year you could do this

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,940
without all the work yeah I mean I guess

00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:02,320
that's true for many features and our

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:05,160
son that that gets math right and what

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,160
we can see we map

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,130
or questions

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:18,730
I think you're quite right I mean that

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:21,370
conflict exists all the time there used

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,670
to be a public domain data set or a

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:27,660
dataset put out for the public of all

00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:30,280
telecommunication masts in the UK and

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,490
one of the major telecommunication

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,830
companies pulled its data from that data

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,480
set and they said we are fed up with

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,640
contributing of two data set the main

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:44,820
purpose of which is to object to us

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:47,080
putting up telecommunication masts now

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,210
that's the point at which mapping

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,460
becomes political and I think that if

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:54,430
one starts with exactly the principle

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:57,190
you've suggested that if it's there and

00:18:54,430 --> 00:19:00,010
you can see it you can map it nobody can

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:03,550
stop you is absolutely the right point

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:05,590
to come from because even if the manager

00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:08,860
of the electrical Network says we will

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,210
feed you our data he moves on next

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,400
manager comes along and says you

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:15,730
shouldn't have done that we can take it

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:20,350
away so I think there's room for the two

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:22,390
but saving time through imports at times

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,670
when the data is available also fights

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,470
me as being a good idea but you need a

00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,130
plan B I think what you've described as

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,130
a good plan B

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,940
yeah I would like to hook in on this

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,080
question because I'm from the

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:54,630
Netherlands and in the Netherlands the

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:58,080
maintain the maintainer of the will

00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:02,490
railway network in the Netherlands royal

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:07,680
company who is actually largely stayed

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:11,760
out actually import it's part of their

00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:17,670
railway network including catenary masts

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:21,090
and they also were at least I know they

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:25,800
were contemplating adding power lines as

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:28,470
well so for the railway system and this

00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,530
is actually we had this kind of

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:34,500
interesting or conflicting situation

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,720
where the company at some points was

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,460
adding data with texts that we didn't

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,560
actually use like that in house M

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,840
because it just showed up because just

00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,510
make it power line and it shows up but

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,390
it's it's different kind of system and

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:54,660
catenary maths and not the normal pylons

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:59,070
that you see so it was a kind of

00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:01,530
conflicting and it but it was actually

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:06,390
the opposite of what you're suggesting

00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:07,890
that the calm that we as editors or osm

00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,050
editors are adding at the day that

00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:13,440
instead the company was importing the

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:15,510
data or adding data because they had a

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,880
strong interest in this it was actually

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:20,550
quite an interesting story because at

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,820
one point one one of those people

00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,110
actually wrote that they use it the Opus

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,940
treatment data is kind of basement

00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:31,110
because it was easier to access than

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:33,060
some of their own web services so yeah

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:36,630
so I think that also highlights a

00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:40,580
potential problem that government

00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:45,970
agencies made some points in the future

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:47,910
try to get kind of hold of part of the

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,980
because that's in their interest and

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,510
theirs so you can have the I actually

00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,220
just want to illustrate that you can

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,650
have the opposite situation where this

00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:01,060
where these these kind of organizations

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:04,740
actually try to well more or less

00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:08,350
dictate what how it should be in in om

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,630
whereas you want the power for that of

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:15,120
course still to be at the community

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:17,320
level and not by some state company so

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,730
it's just an illustration of what can

00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:30,900
happen it is this kind of conflict

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:30,900
situation thank you very much

00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,469
