Title: Interpreting Imagery for OpenStreetMap
Publication date: 2018-09-21
Playlist: SotM 2018, Day 1, De Donato
Description: 
	Chad Blevins, State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/T076-Interpreting_Imagery_for_OpenStreetMap/

At one point or another every mapper has seen something on imagery thatâ€™s hard to distinguish from another feature, or is outright hard to describe. Learning how your eyes and mind work together to interpret imagery is an art and something we can all practice. This session will walk through examples of how you can associate imagery characteristics such as Shape, Size, Shadow, Time, Texture, and Pattern to help mappers improve their mapping skills, and improve OpenStreetMap.

okay so we start now the first talk is

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,830
by Chad bravin's

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:14,299
I hope I'm pronouncing correctly from

00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:18,619
USAID the US Agency for International

00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:21,390
Development and this talk is about

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:31,700
interpreting imagery for OpenStreetMap

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:35,480
so thank you Chad can you hear me okay

00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,480
all right good morning everyone

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:43,350
hi so I'm here with on behalf of the

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,809
United States Agency for International

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:51,930
Development where I work on a team the

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,390
Geo Center which is a small team of

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,090
geographers within a very large agency

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:02,160
and we work to implement and use

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,400
Geographic data to help some of the

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,770
decisions that US aid has to make so

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,150
some of you may be aware but US aid has

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,150
a presence in about a hundred countries

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,630
globally so there's people working all

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,400
over the place all the time and as we

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,990
all know there is a lack of geographic

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,689
data and many of the countries and

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,810
places around the world we have a

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,049
network within US aid of about 80 GIS

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,570
specialists about and you know we always

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,310
hear this this repeated question from

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,110
them you know we need more localized

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,170
data we need data of the places where we

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,240
work and obviously OpenStreetMap is a

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,740
great solution to help provide some of

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,630
that information to them and getting

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,490
that the local context is extremely

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,369
important so one of the things that we

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,170
did a couple years ago under the

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,360
leadership of Patricia Solis was

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,610
launched a youth mappers program and the

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,700
youth mappers program is the Geo centers

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,780
solution to creating that really

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,369
detailed Geographic data that US aid

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,690
implementers and local governments can

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,760
use to help make those types of

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,580
decisions and this is really a two-part

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,860
program so

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,510
there's the remote mapping piece that a

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,580
lot of us are familiar with what we're

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,560
looking at satellite imagery and we're

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,450
tracing features from that imagery and

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,980
then you know there's also the field

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,340
data collection piece and we know this

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,590
is a two-part process and in many cases

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,420
it's really important to lay that that

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,730
groundwork and the base map create that

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,500
base map from imagery before you go out

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,120
into the field to do that field data

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,370
collection or else it's really hard to

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:46,750
orient yourself and figure out where you

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:48,430
are and what you're doing so some of you

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,850
may be familiar with this image right

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:54,400
here it's called the Blue Marble it was

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,590
taken by astronauts on their way to the

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,720
moon back in the 70s I think they kind

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,840
of looked out the back window of the

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,290
spacecraft and saw this full image of

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,730
the earth and took this picture it's one

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,540
of the most famous pictures of the earth

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,690
ever so a couple weeks ago I was playing

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,870
marbles with my five-year-old son Carter

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,610
and you know he has this big box of

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,019
marbles and he likes to play all kinds

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,600
of games throw them around the house

00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,980
make a big mess pick up the marbles and

00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,840
tell me what they look like it's like oh

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,489
dad this looks like Mars and this looks

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,440
like a cat's eye and this looks like an

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:30,730
orange and he picked up it's actually

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,310
this marble right here

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,350
and he said dad this marble looks like

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,420
the earth and when he said that this

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,250
image came to my mind I was like oh man

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,870
I've got to show Carter of this picture

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,700
and ask him what he thinks so the next

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,400
night after dinner I pulled this up on

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,670
my computer and I said Carter what is

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,519
this a picture of he's five years old

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,530
he's like dad that's the earth I said

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,880
okay you're right well how do you know

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,990
it's the earth and he put his hands down

00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:02,410
he's like dad trust me that's the earth

00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:05,200
I wasn't doubting him at all trusting a

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,840
five-year-old so I said well Carter what

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,700
is it about that image that makes you

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,260
know that it's the earth and he said

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,510
well you look dad you can see Braun

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,870
there's land you can see the green

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,810
forest you can see the blue ocean you

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,220
can see the white clouds in snow he says

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,190
look at the bottom you can even see

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,690
Antarctica and he pointed that out to me

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,540
I didn't really notice beforehand but

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,070
the coastline of Antarctica is actually

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,750
pretty phenomenal in this picture and

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,060
that's where penguins are from so he

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,610
loves he loves anything related day in

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:40,720
Arctica so that got me thinking and I

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,460
was like here's a five-year-old who's

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,890
telling me what he's seeing and

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,770
interpreting an image and so this is

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,030
something that he didn't learn in school

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,120
it's something that you're born with and

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:55,270
each of us is born with the ability to

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,200
use our eyes and our brains together to

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,040
help and our experiences on life to help

00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,860
understand what it is that we're

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,080
actually looking at and there's actually

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,150
a whole psychology behind this guesst

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,650
all psychology where the whole is

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,600
something other than the sum of its

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,760
parts and if you look closely at this

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,520
image here on the screen it might just

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,790
look like a bunch of black and white

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,200
blob but if you look closely you can see

00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,950
that in the middle of the scene there's

00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,740
a Dalmatian

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:27,790
that's bending over drinking out of a

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:31,420
bowl raise your hand if you see that all

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,310
right cool and that's something that you

00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,860
may not have seen when you first brought

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:39,160
this up but once I tell you that that

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:43,000
picture is there it's hard not to see it

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:46,600
and we know what that is because we're

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,370
humans and all of us know what a

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,690
Dalmatian is we've seen them in the

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,220
movies we've seen them in real life

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,130
we've seen them riding the fire truck

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,020
right and this is where humans in our

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,600
experience on earth have a distinct

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,580
advantage of interpreting imagery over

00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,570
some of the machine processes that are

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:06,070
out there using machines to support the

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,880
work that we're trying to do I think is

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,710
a fantastic effort

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,810
I'm excited about everything that's

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,270
going on in that field but at the end of

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,490
the day it does take the human touch to

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,120
actually create the map and validate

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,320
everything that we're looking at so the

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,970
next thing I want to do is just walk

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,500
through a couple examples here and we'll

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,050
go over some of the elements of remote

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:31,100
sensing that help you have a better

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,080
understanding of how your brain and body

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,540
work together and your experiences to

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,160
help determine what you're looking at

00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,410
and I think by doing that it'll help you

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,090
become a better photo interpreter or an

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,560
imagery interpreter and this is

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,210
something that you have to practice at

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,150
we're all born with this natural talent

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,860
but it's just like anything else playing

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,150
an instrument the more you practice it

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,340
the more you think about it the more

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,620
that you realize what you're actually

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,900
doing and focus in on those fine details

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,120
the better you're going to become so

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,060
this is a picture of a mountain in West

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,150
Darfur Sudan and just looking at this

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,610
right off the break it looks like a set

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,260
of lips right and it's it's called sort

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,690
of like the lips mountain or the desert

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,240
lips and what is it that makes it look

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,650
like human lips right this is a mountain

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,350
it's a natural feature well obviously

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,900
there's this shape it's just shaped like

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,430
a set of lips there's the color it has a

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,200
different tone to it than the

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,230
surrounding desert and everyone's lips

00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,760
have a different color than their face

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,710
there's the shadow and the height if you

00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,690
look in the middle of that image there's

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:37,100
a ridge line that goes across the middle

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:39,050
and it creates sort of separates the top

00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,660
lip from the bottom lip and there's that

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:45,740
texture there's a more of a the

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:49,790
surrounding area has a smoother texture

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,980
than the mountain itself looking in

00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,960
Katmandu Nepal this is another area

00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,350
that's extremely difficult to map one of

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,970
the first areas that I've mapped there's

00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,660
all the elements of remote sensing going

00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:04,220
on here extremely difficult place to map

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,990
I think it would give a computer a

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,610
really hard time to extract features

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,470
from here but if you look closely you'll

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,060
see the shadows of the roads you can't

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,070
see the roads themselves but you can see

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,350
the shadows some of the different colors

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,180
the shapes the patterns of the buildings

00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,430
the different heights of the rooftops

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,440
there's lots of features and things

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,170
going on on the

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,020
tops gardens and water tanks and water

00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:28,090
heaters and just knowing where you are

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,490
well this is Kathmandu and then

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,400
combining that with the local knowledge

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,099
that you have and if you've actually

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,930
been in Nepal and look down an alleyway

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,820
like this which is very common you'll

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,800
see why it's so difficult to extract

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,370
features and to actually see that road

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:48,820
there's all kinds of laundry lines and

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,350
clown flags and beams supporting the two

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,570
buildings in between so although there

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:58,000
is an actual alley there it's very

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:59,620
difficult to see from up above moving

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,720
just a little bit south and Khulna

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:06,010
Bangladesh this is an agriculture area

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,720
in the country and we all know that this

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,330
is an agriculture area just by looking

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,740
at it and why do we because of the shape

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:17,050
the size and the pattern of those

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:19,480
agriculture fields around in this image

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,880
there's also a if you look in the

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,770
northeastern portion of the scene

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,170
there's a river that kind of comes down

00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,060
it looks like it's not flowing a lot of

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,590
water at this time of the year how do we

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,870
know that well there's some green algae

00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,300
kind of sitting on the top if you look

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,760
about just left of where it says color

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,770
there's a distinct line there that's

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,330
blocking some of the algae flow so we

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,280
know that there's something that's

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,650
impeding the flow of water if it is in

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,930
fact flowing right there in that spot

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,130
and again knowing that this is in Khulna

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,080
bangladesh gives you a better

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,330
understanding of the types of crops they

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,460
grow and why some of these agriculture

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,820
fields have the scattered pattern look

00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,610
that they do because from a ground

00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:04,540
perspective you can see that they've

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:07,690
defied devised a way of conducting and

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,089
create of agriculture in this part of

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,370
the world that allows them to grow crops

00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:15,370
year-round when the country's underwater

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,530
flooded or when it's dry and you can see

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,210
this barrier here with a little drain

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:23,980
pipe that's allowing them to drain water

00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:26,770
from one field to another my hometown

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,420
here washington d.c the US aid office is

00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,300
right just out of sight of this image

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,400
but this is a classic example of height

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,120
and shadow with the National Monument

00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,040
you know use

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,570
some photogrammetric techniques you can

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,960
calculate the height of the National

00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,150
Monument it's 555 feet we also know from

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,040
this scene due to the color and the

00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:48,730
shape of the trees that it's fall

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,200
because the trees are changing color and

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,600
it's beginning to lose their leaves

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,700
there's also still if you look closely

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,110
quite a large number of tourists out

00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,540
there on the mall there's little black

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,210
dots can pick that up and the texture of

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,250
the green might be somewhat dry this

00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,279
time of year because some of the grasses

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:09,790
is turning brown and you'll see here on

00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,670
the left side there's the World War Two

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,960
memorial which is a pond of water and

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,360
you can clearly see that there's a

00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,250
fountain there that's shooting up water

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,500
around because that water is not a

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:24,940
consistent color blue but there's some

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:27,820
white disturbance indicating that yep in

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,070
fact that is a fountain shooting water

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:34,480
looking out on the mall with all the

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:38,170
tourists and that the trees this is one

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,970
of the more interesting scenes places as

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,910
miss dumped me as a photo interpreter

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,170
for years what we're actually looking at

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,959
well this is obviously center-pivot

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,000
irrigation it's in southern province in

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,670
Zambia you can tell by the color and the

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,490
shape and the size that you know there's

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,450
some crop being grown here if you knew

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,339
anything about center-pivot irrigation

00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,830
in this part of the world you'd be able

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:03,910
to somewhat guesstimate the size of

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:05,680
those circles just due to the the type

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,420
of equipment that they use is it 50

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,839
meters is it 100 meters you know what's

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,490
the common size of equipment looking

00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,839
down at the pond in the lower right it

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,480
almost looks like it's a frozen lake

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,810
well in fact it's not it's just like a

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,870
reflection of Sun making it look almost

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,580
frozen or like ice now but the most

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,950
interesting thing in this scene to me as

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,290
a photo interpreter are all these little

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,000
what looked to be bushes or trees that

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,390
are scattered about and if you look in

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,250
that middle circle just past where it

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,620
says shape on the top you can see that

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,940
the green area has is a little

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,370
discolored and there's some lightish

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,050
spots to that and what those are in fact

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,959
and this took me a long time to figure

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,950
out those are termite mounds and the

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,810
termites will grow

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,240
oh and they everyone's probably seen a

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:55,330
termite mound somewhere in the tropics

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,280
they grow very tall and skinny and when

00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,230
they reflect even the smallest shadow

00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,060
it makes them appear like bushes and

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,260
what the farmers have done here is

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,760
they've gone through and they've cleared

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,400
the termite mounds out in the center

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,080
area where it says shape and the

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,730
termites have made such an impact on the

00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,920
earth that you can still see some of the

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,440
discoloration going on even after those

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,060
mounds have been removed and this is a

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:22,510
picture of one of those mounds from a

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:25,840
perspective on earth and the last

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,640
example this is a really cool one it's

00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,500
just an awesome thing to look at from

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,420
imagery this is in the southern San

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:36,100
Francisco Bay and what these are are

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:39,070
salt evaporation ponds and it's a

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,960
project that where they're harvesting

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:44,350
salt from the bay and they create each

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,030
one of these ponds so there's the

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,870
patterns of the ponds there's a shape of

00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:52,060
the ponds and knowing anything about

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,500
salt evaporation and the microbes that

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,810
take place and that calls this

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,280
discoloration in the water you could be

00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,260
able to you could determine just by

00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,570
looking at this that hey these ponds

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,610
here that are red are closer to

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:07,000
harvesting the salt than the ones that

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:09,460
are green out here on the periphery and

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,680
I'm not a salt expert by any stretch of

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:18,280
the imagination but it's a it's a good

00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,690
example of using color in shape as an

00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,980
indicator and even looking up in the

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,120
upper right hand corner of the scene

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,490
here you can see that there's these

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,630
bigger buildings that are indicating an

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,130
industrial area of the city and then

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,930
just looking up in the very very tip

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,550
there's obviously more residential

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:38,610
because there's smaller buildings and

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:41,800
there's that pattern that you can see so

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:45,520
with that you know I just want to you

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,700
know really important sub people you and

00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,620
I in the mapping process and how

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,750
important it is to have that local

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,090
knowledge in that local context when

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:58,930
you're mapping one of the reasons that

00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:01,230
you know we at US aid launched the youth

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,410
mappers program was to get more

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,120
University students involved local

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,280
university students involved to give

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,110
that that perspective that they have of

00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,450
living in that country and knowing what

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,920
it is they're looking at what so with

00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,170
all the advancements that are taking

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,640
place light net right now with deep

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,800
learning and machine learning and I am

00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,600
gonna sit in those talks and listen

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,550
because it's a fascinating topic for me

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,980
at the end of the day it really comes

00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,780
down to the human touch and the

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,650
experiences that we have living on this

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,660
earth and and what it is that we decide

00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:37,500
to put on the map and how it should be

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:40,120
tagged so with that I'll open it up to

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:49,210
questions thank you

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:49,210
[Applause]

00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:00,700
hi thank you for the talk

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,350
and you know there's tons of amateurs in

00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,279
OpenStreetMap we have access to good

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:08,199
imagery we often have but we lack the

00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:11,320
training or many of us lack the training

00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:13,800
to actually deduce all the things that

00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,720
that you've just shown is there anything

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,370
like any kind of literature or good

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,860
websites or something that you can

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,310
recommend for the interested amateur to

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,310
sort of hone their their skills when it

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:32,320
comes to detecting facts from from

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:35,800
imagery yeah you know I I did some

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,410
searching around when I was creating

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,480
this presentation and there is some

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,870
stuff on the internet a lot of it is

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,670
academic based so there's presentations

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,880
from remote sensing courses that are

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:52,089
online that you can review nothing

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,420
really good that I saw you know Patricia

00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:56,920
as we kind of has asked me a couple

00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,290
times a Chad maybe you should put

00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,209
something like this together and create

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:04,270
a resource like a wiki or something on

00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:05,799
the on the OpenStreetMap wiki to give a

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,569
better explanation of what some of this

00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:09,339
is because I think you're right and you

00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,660
know working with these students and

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,630
going to map a Thon's all over the

00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,130
country or all over the world rather the

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,360
one question that you always get you

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,459
know students figure out the tools

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,709
really quick but they say hey you know

00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,720
what is this I'm looking at is that is

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,720
that a building is that a shadow is that

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,250
a wall is that a ditch and I think this

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,929
white thing out here in the courtyard is

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,840
a perfect example if you looked at it

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:33,820
that white thing from imagery you'd be

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,530
like what what is that white thing and

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,130
I'm standing right next to it looking at

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:41,710
it and I'm like what is that white thing

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:44,650
obviously it's art but I could fool you

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,660
if you're looking at it from space so

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,250
yeah I think that one of the next things

00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:53,549
I'll do is try and put some resources

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,549
together for the community Thanks

00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:07,660
okay if there are no more questions oh

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:09,910
that is a question sorry regarding what

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:13,570
you can do to better learn how to

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:16,750
interpret images one suggestion I would

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:18,610
add is what you also showed that compare

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,250
what you see in the images with your

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:23,710
real-world experience on the ground if

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,140
you look at images from areas where you

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,630
know how what this is you have a

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:32,049
percentage of sales that's a very good

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:35,169
training to interpret images because it

00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:37,720
lets you then later also called the

00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:44,110
interpret images from areas where you

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:45,850
don't have current experience that's

00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,289
true yes searching the internet just

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,600
through that area and trying to get some

00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:54,220
ground level in photos is it's really

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,350
helpful I chaired great talk yes it

00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,600
would be fantastic if you could put some

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,070
more stuff together but perhaps that

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,990
will be a really great youth mathis

00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:05,530
project so that they can actually put

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,970
some you know local context I think so

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,970
yeah thanks for the suggestion

00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:22,629
thanks for the presentation chat just

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,340
realized we had tracing guides which

00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:29,229
were examples of imagery and how they

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:35,109
translate the OpenStreetMap features and

00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:36,789
we have photos in the ID editor that

00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:39,669
show the same features from the ground

00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:43,179
but we don't have tracing guides inside

00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:46,029
OS m editors and so maybe put in more of

00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:48,849
that those imagery examples directly

00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:53,769
inside the editors might be a better a

00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:55,869
good idea that's not a bad idea and you

00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:57,820
know I have put together a bunch of

00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:01,359
tracing guides for specific projects

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,159
that I've created and you know you end

00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,139
up having to do that almost for every

00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:08,049
single project just because there's such

00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:10,419
a diversity of mapping areas in the

00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:12,369
world where if you're even on the inner

00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,409
city of Kathmandu where it's super duper

00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:15,849
dense or the outskirts right there's

00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:23,169
almost like a different technique that

00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:25,479
you need to apply that's it let's fill

00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:27,340
them and be contextual to the to the

00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:29,349
mapping if anyone has the technical

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:37,960
skills to do that come talk to me and

00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:39,759
I'll work with you okay so I think we

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,539
can thanks chat for his presentation

00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,539
thank you

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,380
