At one point or another every mapper has seen something on imagery thatâ€™s hard to distinguish from another feature, or is outright hard to describe. Learning how your eyes and mind work together to interpret imagery is an art and something we can all practice. This session will walk through examples of how you can associate imagery characteristics such as Shape, Size, Shadow, Time, Texture, and Pattern to help mappers improve their mapping skills, and improve OpenStreetMap.
