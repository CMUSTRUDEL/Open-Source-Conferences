https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/T079-Can_we_validate_every_change_on_OSM_

OpenStreetMap receives 30,000 changesets everyday. Bad edits vary from novice mapping mistakes to intentional vandalism. Through Mapbox, hundreds of millions of users now view the map. Data quality has become crucial; we cannot afford to have our products affected by bad changes. We will present how we have built bulletproof protection against the daily vandalism we see.

We will focus on what we have learned from our past approaches to catching vandalism. We will also discuss the creation of a new unit of change that scales better than both changesets and individual features. We have taken on the challenge of validating every edit to the map in the quickest time possible while only consuming upstream edits. In addition, we will explore how the community can join and benefit from our validation efforts.

We are entering into an exciting new age for OSM with an unprecedented number of users consuming it daily, and we are excited to help protect the data quality of OpenStreetMap.

William so I will now introduce Lukas

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:14,300
with the question can we validate every

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,300
change on OpenStreetMap

00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:27,099
ciao a tutti I'm Lucas Martinelli from

00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,490
epics and yeah we're going to talk

00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:38,260
whether we can validate every edit in OS

00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:40,750
10 and when I try to switch so mat box

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,090
exposes OpenStreetMap to hundreds of

00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,800
millions of users and because of that we

00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,170
get a lot of eyes on the map there are

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,930
lots of areas where we very rarely look

00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,449
at an open street map and our users see

00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,239
everything so nearly every edit you've

00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:57,850
ever made years back they see it and so

00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:59,949
that makes us kind of a good nervous

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,500
system for OpenStreetMap because we get

00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:04,720
signal early if something is wrong it

00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,659
also means that we can't risk to expose

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,240
like bad quality or vandalism on the map

00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:13,450
because whatever you edit one user in

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,850
our Maps is going to see it and last

00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:19,180
year one challenge we've seen coming up

00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,189
over and over again is vandalism or how

00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,009
we like to call it is harmful data

00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:26,579
because not every vandalism is like with

00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:29,350
malicious intent it can be a mistake and

00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:32,530
that's not an uncommon problem in fact

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,390
as online communities grow the amount of

00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,859
malicious actors usually grows as well

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,390
and one of our friends Vicki media

00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:45,179
actually tackled that problem years ago

00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:48,579
in 2011 it was believed that oh sorry

00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:51,700
is that better it was believed that over

00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:54,880
7% were vandalism of wikipedia edits

00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,140
back in 2011 and we're not me nearly

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,899
there in OpenStreetMap

00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,149
so we're really healthy right now but we

00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:03,189
need to tackle this now to get ahead of

00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:05,139
the problem and the map box we cannot

00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,149
have zero tolerance for vandalism

00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:09,369
because we don't want to expose that to

00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,350
a user and this tells the story of how

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:15,370
we tackle that and try to get that back

00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,490
into OpenStreetMap so what is vandalism

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:21,100
and we need to distinguish between poor

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:25,990
quality mapping or incorrect or ground

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:29,170
truth vs. harmful and this is an example

00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:31,390
where you see very blurry satellite

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,690
imagery so it's hard to judge whether

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,240
it's this likely ground truth could

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,980
P and to map box mapping standards

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,320
that's probably not mapped accurate

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,300
enough so if I would have time

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,410
personally I would go remap it but this

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,530
is not bad data

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,450
it's inconsistence itself with the map

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,780
it doesn't harm anyone it doesn't offend

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:54,450
anyone so for us this is not harmful

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,270
data this is this is okay I would like

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,130
to improve it but it's fine and then you

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:03,420
have this this will throw a user

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:05,910
completely off this is a highway and if

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,400
you user sees that the kind of lens an

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,810
aura of unreliability they lose trust in

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,280
a map oh that's that's not consistent so

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,050
users stop trust in the map which is one

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,630
of the problems we really want to avoid

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,340
and another example is someone

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,470
accidentally removes London from the map

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,900
that's in the same kind of category and

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:28,890
it's very easy to do so we have to

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,930
protect our users from that and I'm just

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,820
gonna walk you through some fun cases

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,670
because it's the most fun part of this

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,800
of things we see and on the left you

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,040
have someone who either traced the shape

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,520
really well or an SVG import I think

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,310
that's that's a wooden area there you

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:50,570
also have a big water body over Paris in

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,530
shape of a bird I think it's cute but

00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,140
want to prevent that and then you have

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,420
lots of people's lives in there that's

00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,330
not necessarily a map label so someone

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:04,800
here really needs help because their

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:08,340
smoke detector won't stop beeping and so

00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,739
yeah maybe we should have a system to

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,660
monitor this cries for help but in this

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,320
case all help we can offer is to change

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,000
that name and revert that change set

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,400
then you have some people try to

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,810
advertise on the map now because there's

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,630
hundreds of amount of users looking at

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:28,020
it someone here is a really good dentist

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:30,240
and I'm gonna consider that next time I

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,610
go but I still think the names should be

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,050
cheaper and then you also have big fans

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:40,410
of Cristiano Ronaldo where someone

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,729
renamed a national park there's also

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,660
some comedy in there

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,550
where

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,030
people renamed it backing a palace -

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,330
granny palace yeah

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,550
[Music]

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,990
also some statements I think that's fair

00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:01,930
it's still not accurate and Daniels have

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:04,080
this classic editing failure where we

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,520
call this the case of the mysterious

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,900
transcontinental blue line that started

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,920
showing up in our map it's actually a

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:14,890
waterway that spans the earth so we want

00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,620
to print these kind of cases or this the

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,830
yellow is a modified Road and this is

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,220
where someone you see the way snapped to

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,690
the wrong note over and over again and

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,610
this can go horribly wrong and for

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,680
navigation use cases or even the map

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,150
that will totally throw you off that's

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,390
harmful they tie introduced into the

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,390
system or someone removed the highway

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,730
tack not bad but it also means a

00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:43,270
deletion and kind of roads and so they

00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:46,000
caused the mass deletion accidentally or

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:50,640
I'll this one my favorite ones you see

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,640
an entire person's life in those edits

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,910
someone plays to lamp piano that's where

00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:03,100
it's neighbors neighbors house we have a

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,930
case for open dog and open cat map here

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,120
I've also seen users who map all of

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,750
their neighbors names or college

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,860
students mapping their dorms which is a

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:16,480
bit critical because you don't want to

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:21,360
expose people's names in the map what is

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,360
that that is a kindergarten

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:27,300
and that's the most controversial I go

00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,830
here in those slides there's also lots

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,529
of profanity edits that I won't show

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,569
here so to give you we've gone through a

00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:36,779
bunch of examples and I want to give you

00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:38,789
the numbers to this the most common one

00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:42,300
and this is per million changes is

00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:44,969
incorrect labels these are the ones such

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,330
as mrs. Minnie's house or my neighbor's

00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:51,059
loud piano that are not met labels more

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,429
like statements but if the next cone one

00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:56,459
is editing failures mostly direct notes

00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:58,789
it's fairly frequent we also have plain

00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:01,469
spam fantasy mapping on null island

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:05,279
people just creating random water bodies

00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:06,959
all over the place and then we have

00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,930
harmful deletions which is the case of

00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,399
deleting London or vast area of roads

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,830
that I'm not even talking about reverts

00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,159
here just someone deletes something

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,779
really important or important highway

00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:20,339
and there are much rarer cases but those

00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:22,319
are the most tragic ones which are

00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,809
obscene labels or profane labels that we

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,869
really don't want to expose to anyone

00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:30,990
because kids use maps millions of kids

00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:32,519
use them and it really throws us off and

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,800
it's a huge problem for corporations

00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,259
because it affects the reputation of

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,059
both the community and someone like Matt

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:42,389
box and then you also have graffitis

00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:43,949
those are the most fun but I think

00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:47,759
someone went really all the way out here

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:49,829
of tracing this this planet means

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,769
something like the last Chinese warning

00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:56,909
which means it's a warning when no

00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:58,649
action will ever happen as follow-up so

00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,959
we have this huge amount of daily

00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:03,439
changes and as if you make a map product

00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,369
you want to keep your product as

00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,809
up-to-date with OpenStreetMap as

00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:10,169
possible because you want to prevent

00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:11,759
data drift and that's challenging if you

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:15,419
have vandalism because you want to at

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,759
the same time protect from that and you

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,949
get around 2 million features touched

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,819
daily that could be modified deleted

00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:25,619
edit and if you see the too long to read

00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,329
summary of this is it's all buildings

00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:28,800
and roads in terms of volumes what

00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:30,719
happens globally it's really all

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,750
buildings and roads some rare land use

00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,580
land cover there are around 10,000 label

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,040
edits so name edit

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,900
and I'm excluding house numbers here we

00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:44,100
have around 30,000 change sets every day

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:48,570
it's under 1% what is vandalism which is

00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:51,330
really good and 2% would not meet the

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,450
minimum mapping requirements of of map

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,640
out so we would like to remap those but

00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:01,860
we we have no good way of doing that

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,480
right now and then we have 20,000 people

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,060
joining every month and making edit

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,670
which is wonderful we still have to help

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,520
them somehow because what we found is

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,590
30% of new users make some mistake or

00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,440
they tagged a building wrong within

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,860
their first 10 edits so those 20,000

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,330
people that's a lot of edits we kind of

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,160
we kind of can ask for a review now in

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:27,030
ID which is great that we have to help

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,710
out and there you see like how a month

00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:34,740
looks like in edits can be anything

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:37,830
between 3 million to 1 millon edits so

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,480
we've try to address this problem a box

00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,040
for the past years and we've iterated on

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,010
this three or four times and what we

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,500
found is if this huge range of potential

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,020
vandalism that can happen and you start

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,460
out by writing some algorithms because

00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,610
that'll solve everything you start

00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:56,580
detecting profanity you start detecting

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,830
very sharp impossible angles you go to

00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,230
monitor new users you start blacklisting

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,300
users but all of that only protects a

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,990
very small range of the potential

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,600
vandalism that can happen and the only

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,670
way we found to really understand what's

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,040
going on is to sample everything someone

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,070
has to look at everything and we humans

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:21,000
are really good at doing that and I've

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:23,040
heard about user reputation we found

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,840
while users make more mistakes and more

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,850
prone to vandalism doesn't mean someone

00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,290
experienced isn't too vandalism there

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,080
are people who have 2000 edits and

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:35,730
decide to rename a town to something

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:38,550
profane so that's not you we removed

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,160
user reputation for that case and look

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,690
at every edit and the statement here is

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,880
one approach doesn't address all cases

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,650
of vandalism our catch-all is human

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,540
review and we have lots and lots of

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:52,220
machine out great

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:54,050
that try to help out as well and I'm

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,420
gonna explain our approach with here and

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,279
the first three steps are kind of off

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,130
bringing osm into a good shape to do

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,889
this work to review everything one is to

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,690
break up osm the monolayer into data

00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:09,589
layers because there's a lot of niche

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:15,709
stuff so you break it up by building

00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:17,319
roads water and then we we go away from

00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,029
the change that model we actually

00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:23,360
partition it day by day so you have a

00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:25,250
day's worth of update by layer and that

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,199
rolls up a lot of activity there may be

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,639
a hundred change sets mapping each one

00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:31,430
individual building that's all gets

00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,440
rolled up in a batch of changes per day

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,319
we found is a really good unit of change

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,019
and then we want to go more granular so

00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:42,319
we kind of redefine a known change set

00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:45,069
which we call kind of Delta's or what we

00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:47,449
do is we cluster those daily changes

00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:49,970
spatially and so you get a more uniform

00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:51,589
distribution if someone Maps 3,000

00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,560
buildings in one change set that's too

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:57,110
much for one person to look at and that

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,480
is specific per per layer and I have

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,699
some example fears of a big change set

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,709
that modifies roads and buildings and so

00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:09,370
on and those could kind of broken up

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:09,370
into smaller more reviewable change sets

00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,510
so we end up from those 30,000 change

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:16,610
sets in around 80,000 of those Delta's

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,350
that we want to review every day and so

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,779
we look at the new state of the map

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,310
compared to yesterday on a daily basis

00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:23,949
and say what's good about the new state

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:28,639
of the map compared to yesterday and

00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:30,350
then you go on day by day and so the

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,180
next step is to review those daily

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,610
changes that you found out and review

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,459
means not only human review but running

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,430
like edit distance algorithms and doing

00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:46,310
all of that and I'll talk a little bit

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:49,040
more later it's also important and when

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,139
we review and something is bad and we

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,110
fix it we still want to apply to update

00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:56,870
so we kind of freeze that part of

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,389
isolated this and those are those

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,880
persist over multiple days so let the

00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:02,800
next day if someone fixes it

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,180
we get a chance to look at that modified

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,070
changeset again and say Oh yesterday

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,300
state was bad today state of that change

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:16,120
that is good though so thumbs up and

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:18,760
then we apply those daily validated

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,470
batches of updates on our map products

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,320
so for maps this means reran during all

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:26,080
the tiles but only the updates that are

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,970
good and you see at no way ever here

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,900
happens and edit this is all app stream

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,770
every fix happens upstream so it's just

00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,720
delaying that a little bit and then

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,030
abstract applying them later on as

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,870
they're fixed and once you've collected

00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:43,270
this huge amount of things you've tagged

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,890
and flagged you try to share them and

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,610
I'm going to talk more about how we

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:52,510
share them and you fix them and that

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:55,330
continues day by day you have a batch of

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:57,790
those diffs you go fix them the next day

00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:00,070
they come in as fixed ifs or someone in

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:05,760
the community fixes them immediately so

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:09,880
you get a chance to look at it again and

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,100
I want to talk some methods we use for

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,650
machine review that are a little bit

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,590
less known I think linters are quite

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:19,990
commonly known for like sharp angles or

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,780
topology linting another one is

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,450
profanity checking which is having some

00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,610
simple profanity checking that try a lot

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,220
a lot of languages to see whether it

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,510
matches to something in a dictionary

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,650
there's a lot of profanity that can

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,560
happen OpenStreetMap that I'm not

00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:37,750
showing on the slides and this is the

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,040
first line of defense and another one is

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,420
using some natural language processing

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,860
techniques map labels have very unique

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,210
natural language properties they usually

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,590
don't have possessives

00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:52,870
they're not sentences so you can really

00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,790
kind of build classifiers that assess

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,510
how likely it is to be a cartographic

00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:00,820
label or a place name or a street name

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,270
versus just a text because someone could

00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:07,270
also spam and tire OpenStreetMap of text

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:08,920
on the right you see a lot of shapes of

00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,410
buildings that have been marked or

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,840
classified as buildings and you can

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,769
build a classifier that says how likely

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,829
is this shape to be

00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:19,660
building verses of water body and so you

00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:21,879
would detect graffitis like that as well

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,879
to some degree or someone accidentally

00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:27,129
mapping about your body as building you

00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,499
also want to monitor drastic changes to

00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:33,189
very stable features again the London

00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:34,779
example those are varies I wish we would

00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:36,879
have stable identifiers features that

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,209
shouldn't change too much so you wanna

00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:45,040
monitor if huge added distances happen

00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:47,470
and now to the human review we kind of

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,779
review changes in four dimensions which

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:52,119
cover nearly all of the text surface

00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:54,269
that's possible one is geometric shapes

00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:57,970
and on the right you see kind of a

00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:59,860
tinder like interface where you swipe on

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,559
the good edits versus the the ones you

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,519
like less and in this case we look at

00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,199
building shapes and we found an airplane

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,059
here mapped in the water which is very

00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:15,910
common people love mapping airplanes on

00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:17,619
satellite imagery and we go through with

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,920
a high speed and kind of flag what's

00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:22,869
really an outlier we do that for labels

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,910
we look at every label we look at

00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:27,369
hierarchy such as motorway and you see

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:30,549
then we classify those changes and you

00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:32,829
see it for water bodies we disk if we go

00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:35,470
through the water bodies and at the end

00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:38,970
you'll see we'll see so we'll find some

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,970
triangle or watcher bodies that are bad

00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:45,100
so those are all the consistent that

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,089
looks not like something that should be

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:51,069
in the map and then we QA all those

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:54,309
reviews so a review team really got

00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:57,009
sampled we know if you have a hundred

00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:59,529
gravities that will find 99% of them

00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:01,329
together if the machine review and we

00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:03,129
kind of then take this big batch it was

00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:07,000
flagged and single out the most harmful

00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:09,189
features so review team reviews 80,000

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,709
changes every day we flag around 2,000

00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:14,199
changes that something is kind of low

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:16,510
quality that ends up in two hundred

00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,389
really harmful defects that our team

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:21,100
goes and fixes the good news is fifty

00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:23,169
percent of those issues are already

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,149
fixed once we come and try to fix them

00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:27,010
on us and so there were some community

00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:28,329
keeps up with some but then there also

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,809
incidents or something remain

00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:36,880
for six months in the map here is a map

00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:42,039
of our daily catch here with things

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:46,029
we've cut and we want to share those

00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:47,860
detections and right now we want to do

00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:49,960
that on awesome cha and make it a kind

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,029
of one-stop shop for OS invalidation and

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,010
we make all our harmful detections

00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,750
public if you're going to at some chance

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,690
search for the flag for review by map

00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,870
box filter you should find the change

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,970
sets that we mark as bad and want to fix

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,610
and then we regularly go through and fix

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,010
those we still try to iterate better on

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,350
how we share that and I hit me up later

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,360
on of how how you want to collaborate

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:16,750
that multiple people and companies can

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,450
share their detections and here you see

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,880
a complete example where the gif started

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:26,110
a bit ahead where I see something in

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,730
awesome cha I I go down on go to fix it

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,429
in IDE in under a minute

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:34,539
I took probably a second to flag this as

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:37,809
bad and then here see I found something

00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:39,820
that's tact I verified as bad it's

00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:42,909
unintentional this is a direct note it's

00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:46,779
unresolved yet I jump over to

00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:49,600
OpenStreetMap I see the element I edit

00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:52,029
it I am snap it from the other node I

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,539
fix it and save it all in under minutes

00:18:52,029 --> 00:19:04,059
and we've reverted that really harmful

00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:05,679
change so what are the takeaways here

00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,049
there were some community is remarkably

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,360
healthy right now only a very low

00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:12,309
percentage of edits is harmful which is

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,950
amazing I think they've cultivated a

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:16,929
really good community we got a watch out

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,000
though and one thing to notice where

00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:22,000
some is eventually consistent when you

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,950
take a snapshot you will catch vandalism

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,470
and we do a map boxes we kind of lag

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,169
behind to always provide you a

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,360
consistent validated view of

00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,799
OpenStreetMap and we really need to work

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,240
together to protect the future of

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,179
OpenStreetMap that vandalism doesn't

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,799
become a bigger problem and we need

00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:40,770
better shared monitoring efforts for

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:46,490
that share our detections

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:46,490
work together to fix them and that's it

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,049
[Applause]

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:21,220
so we have five minutes for questions

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:26,770
okay oh no cost policy monk I have two

00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:30,520
questions and one is more general have

00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:35,110
you seen an actual relative increase in

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:39,340
vandalism or is it simply the number of

00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:42,310
contributions increasing our data size

00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,530
increasing that means that in absolute

00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,970
terms we have more vandalism oh that's a

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,130
great question and I had to skip over

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:51,000
that I think that changed last year as

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:53,680
our user demographics changed more

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,600
Pokemon go is a really big one I think

00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,560
that brought a whole new set of mappers

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,380
OpenStreetMap you could say the same for

00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,510
snapchat and so I think the users

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,080
demographics are changing so I would say

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:11,160
since last year that's true okay my

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:15,510
other point is fairly specific law and

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:19,930
accidentially last week I ran into some

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:23,650
vandalism in Switzerland very low-key

00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:29,680
loser changing his username every so

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:30,400
five six edits and what he did or she

00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,320
did

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:37,870
who knows was actually game place names

00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,580
in in a way that I don't believe that

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,920
you would be TechEd and I actually went

00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:45,130
back to awesome horn and checked whether

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,230
these edits were flagged by by Matt Fox

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:51,420
Bros I assume that was what this meant

00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:53,830
and none of those edits were flagged and

00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,900
essentially they they create a place

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,960
name stuff that looked like place names

00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,870
that were obscene and racist in some

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,060
cases and so I still think you know

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,340
there's just relying on machine learning

00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,840
too

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,070
take this stuff is going to be very

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,440
difficult you actually have to be a

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,110
native speaker of the language to

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:17,940
realize oh this is actually not a good

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:19,950
place now so two points we're still

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,740
trying to work out how to best share our

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,630
detections so only the detection of the

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,840
last month we really kind of were able

00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,760
to get into so it might very well be

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,340
that we did catch that because we have

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,690
good profanity detection for German we

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,620
even have a Swiss dictionary for

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:40,260
profanity for native speakers we we try

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:43,320
to translate it or try to get people who

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:45,120
speak the language of that label so I

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,910
think we might have caught that it's not

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:52,440
us and Cha but there are some really

00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:53,580
really intricate ways to do vandalism if

00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,600
you really really want to hurt

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,470
OpenStreetMap and we can only find out

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,530
over time

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:03,870
how those attacks look like and I guess

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,950
improve map gardening overall to catch

00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,260
these incidents where the local

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,670
community needs to find it so I would

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,430
say the answer to that is to improve map

00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:13,830
gardening and people looking out and

00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,740
maintaining their their area they know

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:21,110
best

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:25,020
thus my books look for Pokemon go parks

00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:26,690
maps and all parts yeah because they

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,940
increase vamp on

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:32,580
spawn points yes that's actually one of

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,700
the first cases we started to look at

00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:38,130
it's a very big correlation between

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:41,130
parks in urban areas that overlap and

00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:50,910
our new users we're fairly confidence we

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:54,030
catch those high so I think I think it's

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:56,940
great the map box are one part of Open

00:23:54,030 --> 00:24:00,120
Street Map helping it out to kind of fix

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,520
these things especially your tools to

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,610
identify bad changes and it seems

00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,710
they're often mistake so I wondered are

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,870
you if you're able to identify place

00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,320
like Geographic places where there are

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:15,890
lots of mistakes are you connecting with

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,230
the local communities to kind of help

00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,930
you know actually do some education and

00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:24,740
training local matters so we don't get

00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:26,750
the mistakes in the first place I think

00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,160
you see a fairly uniform distribution

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,290
across the world where mistakes are

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:36,050
happening we also see a load of remote

00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:38,270
mapping especially for vandalism I think

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,820
those are really new users often in the

00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,170
mistakes that are hard to kind of

00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,920
integrate in a community and teach like

00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:47,630
that so it's all about onboarding I

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,700
think in this case and it's still that a

00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,500
new user can edit anything they can go

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,940
and change London which is the powerful

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,250
thing about Open Street Map but also the

00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:58,310
dangerous as we're at millions of users

00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:01,610
now so I don't have a clear answer for

00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:08,780
that except make the onboarding flow

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:11,390
better for new users I think thanks for

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:14,210
your chat I just build on what Gregory

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,830
said so we have all these tools we have

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,570
all these techniques for how to make the

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,790
data better but we haven't thought about

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,680
how to help the community improve right

00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,630
so when we say local onboarding and

00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,770
mapathon Xand better training a better

00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,800
validation at mapathon

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,600
how do we connect and so my challenge

00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,950
really is not just format bucks for it

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,560
but for everybody how do we better use

00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,870
our brains in terms of technical

00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,180
development connect the question of an

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:40,670
improvement back to the user so for

00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,020
example I would sign up for something

00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,120
that said hey here's some tips and

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,070
tricks I would sign up for a welcome

00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,660
onboarding I would sign up for someone

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,030
they can know we get comments on our

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,120
edits but it'd be nice to have like a

00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:54,650
mentor that'd be awesome thanks so a

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,260
Matt Matt make matchmaking

00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,680
I think the review functionality in IDE

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:05,630
plus the notes that are coming now are

00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:08,810
perfect examples of that thank you for

00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:11,510
the lecture Lucas and was it possible

00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:15,050
for you to find out it there are regions

00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:18,640
with more vandalism and regions with

00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,640
less vandalism

00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:26,560
there's always political content areas

00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:28,660
I only have a hunch it seems where

00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,610
there's more mappers going on that's

00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,560
happening more frequent so Europe it's

00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,240
actually fairly common to see it but

00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,040
it's fairly uniform I wouldn't make a

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,520
statement about regions being more prone

00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,350
to vandalism than others high visibility

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,100
areas but that's not always true people

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:46,920
often

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,920
fantasy map in the middle of nowhere a

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,100
last question you told us that user

00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,720
reputation is not a good is not a

00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,670
perfect indicator because there are

00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,920
rapid data users who are to provide

00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:02,650
harmful data but aren't those cases

00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,780
outliers I mean I was wondering about

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:09,930
this story thank you

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:14,680
those are outliers but I still would not

00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:16,150
solely rely on a reputation system like

00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,310
if you let's say we have a reputation

00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,770
system and only someone who has hundreds

00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:22,810
of edits is allowed can edit London or

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,340
otherwise has to be reviewed you will

00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:27,850
always need to review four really

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,680
important features yeah those are out

00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:36,910
outliers relative to new users in terms

00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:40,000
of sheer volume so that was the last

00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:43,060
question sorry for who couldn't ask

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,140
their own questions now you we have a

00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:51,030
break of half an hour and then we start

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,030
