00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,020
piÃ±on sorry if you had to wait in the

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,599
queue for registration it's always a bit

00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:34,070
busy it's great to see a really full

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:38,190
room here which means we're going to be

00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:41,129
directing people to s0 - there's still

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,520
seats there and I'm being livestream

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,410
there I'm also being live-streamed to

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,160
youtube so if you're watching at home

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,720
hello YouTube they don't reply hopefully

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,340
there'll be some tweets that will tell

00:00:51,720 --> 00:01:03,870
us that it's working and people are

00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:08,210
watching this and say welcome so we have

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:16,860
people from over 56 countries here

00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:19,440
OpenStreetMap massive community we want

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,810
to be kind as a community and to make

00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,320
friends whether they're old friends

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:28,049
we're meeting again or new friends so we

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,250
have a code of conduct that helps define

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,689
that and if if you sort of think there's

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,570
a reason that people aren't being

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:41,250
welcoming or there's an issue you can

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:43,520
talk to me Gregory or Francesca is our

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,320
other code of conduct volunteer and

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,469
we'll talk that free depending what it

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,899
is and help you out the code of conduct

00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:55,259
is on our website and on page five of

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,929
your booklets so everyone present

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,649
whether you're a sponsor a delegate a

00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:04,950
speaker your first time here or your

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:08,460
tenth time here then you should follow

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,470
the code of conduct so I'm going to talk

00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,230
there's a lot of information it's a very

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,960
packed weekend hopefully on your

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,460
registration you all got a nice bag in

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:23,190
that bag it's a booklet like this I'm

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,280
already using it to refer this is very

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:31,290
helpful as is the Android app that's

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,330
been made for us and however we send

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,550
this to the printers and then we realize

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,510
there's some mistake

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:42,500
one of the big mistakes is sometimes it

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:47,420
says the second track is in s0 free it

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:51,410
actually means s0 to which I'll explain

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:54,140
where that is in a moment and if you're

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,690
unsure what is the correct x or the

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,510
correct session the website which is at

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,450
the bottom there 2018 state of the map

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,600
dot org that is the truth that is the

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,970
most up-to-date thing other than ground

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,530
truth if you're in a session the speaker

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:13,340
that's there's probably the one that's

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:17,870
going to speak but you know we like to

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:20,750
know what's true and of course you can

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,160
see me in this beautiful red shirt and

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,770
there's other people around the room

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,880
they are here to help you so if you have

00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,800
any questions and ask them say hi if you

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,440
just want someone to say hi to say hi to

00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,420
them if they don't know the answer or

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,040
they're too busy they'll be able to

00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,390
point you to someone who does know the

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,390
answer and can help you out

00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,459
this is probably an important slide as

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,050
well to connect to the Wi-Fi I can see

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,209
you all getting your phones out you know

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,500
you got a tweet about how awesome the

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:57,170
maps are and and the exciting things you

00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:01,490
learn here so you connect the Wi-Fi

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:04,310
network is pulling me access it you then

00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,080
go to a web page and click access o

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,420
Wi-Fi or spitty

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,000
my Italians not great but I'm told

00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,580
that's the guest Wi-Fi sorry if I

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,830
pronounced any Italian wrong and and

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,080
then type in that username and password

00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,180
I think that stuck up near the door and

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,600
it's also on the Welcome Desk as well

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,610
and I see you all typing we're a bit

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,980
tight on time but I don't want to leave

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,220
you without a connection quick quick

00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,140
quick

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:35,720
take your photo and then you can type it

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:37,550
in later okay and I want to thank all

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,860
our sponsors you can see them up there

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,740
you can see them here some of them have

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,900
little stools around so go and talk to

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,759
them they've really helped make state of

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,710
the map happen by supporting it

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,870
and paying for the things that need to

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,449
be paid we've got a lot of volunteer

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,300
help but we can have done it with these

00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:59,879
sponsors I want to particularly thank

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,189
our our main sponsors that have come

00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:07,139
back to support us again Facebook

00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:10,080
Microsoft being a matte box they all

00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:12,900
have had a talk accepted to the program

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,939
as well so I think they're gonna be

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,669
speaking on some interesting things than

00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,830
what each of them are doing and involved

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:22,469
in in the OpenStreetMap world so that's

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,719
a good place and you've probably all

00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:29,240
heard of those companies that let's see

00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:34,050
what they have to say to us as well and

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:37,319
oh it's a bit slow and also in your bag

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,229
you all have found these five stickers

00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,449
oh I've used one already there is a

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:44,610
place to competition I'm about to tell

00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:47,909
you where it is you use your blue

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,490
stickers to vote so go up look at the

00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:53,520
posters and they'll have a little white

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:56,879
sign with with their name on just stick

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,710
you can use one sticker for each poster

00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,500
you know you can't vote twice for the

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,930
same poster put a sticker and it's

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,310
disappear fun will count out and

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,339
announce the winner so they can

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:11,159
celebrate that and say they're the best

00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:13,050
poster of state of the map in addition

00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:15,899
to the competition there's also some

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,699
academic posters from people who

00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:22,680
couldn't make it they won't have space

00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:24,389
to vote but you can enjoy the poster so

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,449
you want to know where that is this is

00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:31,680
the the floor plan the green arrow is

00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:34,469
where you came in today DiDonato is

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,599
where we are and you can see the red

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:39,300
tables are where our sponsor stools are

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,669
so as I said go and talk to them if you

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,069
then walk around this corner I'm not

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:46,740
showing it very well but if you walk

00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:51,449
around the corner kind of that way from

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,219
the room there's some signs and a little

00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:55,889
walkway and that will take you to the

00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:57,449
place of the competition if you don't go

00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:00,479
down there and you continue down the

00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:02,340
corridor past are the food that we'll be

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,500
having a break

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,860
in the corner the orange tables are

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,410
where our local chapters will be so you

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,050
can go and you know there's I think six

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,830
local chapters of the foundation great

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,480
to know about OpenStreetMap around the

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:21,000
around the world and and what they're

00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,280
doing and then there's a few more

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,240
sponsors that you can talk to before

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,760
going into s02 which is our second

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,260
Chacon and that's the one that sometimes

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,970
on the program it says s03

00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,250
the stairs are in each corner but

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,220
perhaps the easiest is to go up the

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:47,340
stairs by the by the local chapters and

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:49,200
you've got s 1.3 s 1.4 1.5 and 1.6 and

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,740
there'll be some talks and things in

00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:56,430
there and spaces as I said it's a

00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,470
action-packed program lots of very talks

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,480
we got workshops that are more

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:05,790
interactive there's new this year is the

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:10,530
academic track that Marco is leading for

00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:12,120
us so this is researchers they've kind

00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:16,050
of been selected with a more rigorous

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,060
scientific committee but you don't have

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,460
to be an academic everyone's welcome to

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,530
go and and that's on Sunday it's a full

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,510
track an extra column in your program

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,380
that we've had to squeeze into the

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:31,590
booklet there's some extra sessions so

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,719
we have lightning talks which are five

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,960
minute kind of really snappy to the

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,690
point talks we still have some spaces to

00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,839
sign up to that maybe you didn't make

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,940
the kind of submissions for for talks

00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,940
but you've you've done something since

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,760
that you want to talk about over by the

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,830
Welcome Desk there's plaister you can

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,890
just write your name up and and then

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,470
that slot is yours we also have this

00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,720
idea of bookable spaces which some

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,880
people call birds of a feather and the

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,750
idea is OpenStreetMap there's lots of

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,300
little communities and you know there's

00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,830
the Iowa struggle there's so many to

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,650
think there's like the transport

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,150
community there's the maybe diversity

00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,400
community there's people

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,800
working in America that maybe want to

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,590
meet art people that go to maptime

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,810
meetups so if you want to find people

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,610
like to you part of your subgroup maybe

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:30,120
there's something you need to discuss in

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,630
that you can go to the bookable spaces

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,640
poster and sign up there just break your

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,070
subject in one of the time slots and

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,490
you've got four to five minutes to meet

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:44,460
and chat and introduce very informal and

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:47,130
very fun so if you sign up there that's

00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,610
in one room I come from it it's one

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:53,250
point six is the book of all space and

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,810
if if you just maybe you haven't put

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,570
somewhere but you start chatting you

00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,790
want somewhere a bit quieter to go in a

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,580
