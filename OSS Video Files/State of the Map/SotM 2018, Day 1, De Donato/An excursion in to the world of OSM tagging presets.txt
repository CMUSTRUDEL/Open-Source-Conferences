Tagging presets have a large influence on how and in how much detail OSM contributors map. OpenStreetMap affords itself the luxury of multiple completely separate, independently developed preset systems.

The talk investigates how different the systems are and how, if at all, this reflects in map data contributions.

okay so the next talk is from by Simon

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,219
Poole which I think needs no

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,429
introduction

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:17,460
but it was telling me that I he has been

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:21,779
the president of the Swiss OpenStreetMap

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:25,460
chapter and now I'll leave you to your

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,460
presentation thank you

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:41,620
Nachi things go wrong starting so hi

00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:45,310
everybody when I started mapping as a

00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:50,830
relative Lake coma to OpenStreetMap in

00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:52,540
2010 I started off with potlatch there

00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,890
wasn't a one at that point in time

00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,340
because it was the first version of

00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:59,190
potlatch I think most people that

00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,200
started around that time were the same

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,580
and you know when I mapped I just

00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,860
entered a key and tagged a value and I

00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,410
didn't look that up anywhere perhaps in

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,260
the Vicky but I didn't use a preset or

00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:19,840
so even though potlatch one had preset

00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:22,600
support and now over the years partially

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,950
due to my involvement with developing

00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,979
Vespucci I always use presets all the

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:34,240
time and I first thought well maybe

00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:36,520
maybe that's due to you know there being

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,390
a lot more tags now than they used to be

00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:44,170
and actually that is true but it isn't

00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:48,100
so drastic and I actually produced a

00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,740
number for the number of tags that have

00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:55,930
more than 10,000 users just in 10 in

00:01:50,740 --> 00:02:01,830
2010 and 2018 the anticlimax is it was

00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:06,220
1,500 in 2010 and it's still 1500 in

00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,900
2018 and the underlying reason for that

00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,239
is probably that most of them are

00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,459
nonsense and so you can't actually see

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,170
the change and that would figure that

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,780
out you would actually have to manually

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:20,549
check out everything which doesn't make

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:26,560
sense and I didn't do that was too lazy

00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:28,840
so in the beginning we had the Java

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,209
applet actually I'm not quite sure where

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,750
we had the Java applet as a editor

00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:37,959
because there's no timeline of editors

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,519
over the history of OpenStreetMap and

00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,400
there were a handful of other editors

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,030
around but it's impossible to tell when

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,060
were they

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,550
used how long did they stay alive a lot

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,330
of them got killed off in 2009 when we

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:56,959
changed the API to the current version

00:02:52,330 --> 00:03:03,319
so history there is a bit murky but the

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:06,830
great thing the great thing is that the

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:10,330
people that wrote these editors two of

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:15,709
them at least in this room or released

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:17,630
at this conference and everybody who

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,700
worked on these presets I'm going to

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,450
show you is actually here at this

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:27,380
conference so the Java applet had

00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:34,640
something like that of 40 presets for

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:40,370
each one a bit more and joslyn late 2007

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:43,069
that's 180 presets and the format that

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,160
was used for by Joslin in 2007 is very

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:50,290
similar to what it was today and in

00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:53,690
general things haven't changed that much

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:57,680
now I offer a definition for a preset is

00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:00,019
a template containing suggestive keys

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,630
and associated values for specific

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:06,140
real-world objects now this is wrong

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:08,269
because Franco in Jotham you have

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,730
utility presets which just add a couple

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:13,430
of tags and don't actually correspond to

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,789
a real-world object but I'm leaving that

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,739
away right now and the other way of

00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:23,990
putting it is that the presets bring

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:28,210
order into chaos perhaps now there's

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:31,039
quite a few of preset systems around I

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:34,160
have to say as a developer this is

00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:43,150
mainly a result of rampant not invented

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:46,370
here syndrome if you point out here one

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:49,490
of the things to note is that between

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:52,039
Joe Simon ID potlatch - you have an

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,100
order of magnitude difference in current

00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,880
edits

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,460
then another order of magnitude to the

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,010
group of these four editors and orsome

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,430
and is actually even though it has a

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,560
fairly extensive preset system another

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,590
order of magnitude smaller so we're

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,330
talking about hundreds of millions here

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,300
tens of millions here

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:24,480
millions here and here were around about

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:27,090
100,000 and these systems are all very

00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:31,440
similar that's why I say you know not

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:36,540
invented here it's really taken Klee not

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,810
very different so but do presets matter

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,690
and I have to prefix this section with a

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:46,350
remark because presets are so strongly

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:49,440
integrated into ID all the examples

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,450
actually so things that happened with ID

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,060
because there's no way you can get

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,650
around the presets there there have been

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,500
errors in jozhin which have been around

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:07,800
for a decade but they've just not had

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:13,040
such a large effect it's not showing the

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,040
graph for some reason it's not good

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,860
not quite sure why this is the case I

00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:28,979
can't show you thing anything there in

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:35,330
that case so getting to the interesting

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:38,580
part in any case the what I did here was

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:44,789
convert ID present presets to jozin

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:49,409
format I spent a long time looking at

00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:50,789
stuff like this which that produce can

00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:55,439
see that there are a couple of funny

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:58,860
values in there there something there

00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:03,240
I always said oh that can't be but

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:05,599
actually if you actually look trying to

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,599
fix this

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,889
not that sure what's wrong

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:29,939
yeah just go out let's see no I'll show

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,939
you the slide and it's just a sweetie

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:53,190
let's take the core problems okay

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,190
[Music]

00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:01,430
they're not just do it without that nope

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:06,770
anyway so what I did was convert ID

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:09,160
please please let's do chosen format and

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:13,400
when I did that I expanded the list of

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:16,340
values for top-level objects so imagine

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,260
you have a preset for buildings and you

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,560
could have separate preset for building

00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,020
residential building industrial and so

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,730
on

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,900
but you know that would mean that you'd

00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:34,390
have a hundred different presets so

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,390
typically people combine presets into

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:45,640
drop-down lists and so what I did here

00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,640
is expand these never sure

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:00,990
if you can save to PDF basically you can

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,990
try

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,160
I'm sitting here

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,519
yeah

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,750
that's nathan is SPG's well that's the

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,750
funny thing

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,340
and just go down

00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,490
yeah yeah this it's funny a quitter

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,490
there yeah and defeat you

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,750
okay I don't think there's any point in

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,470
trying to fix the graphs we'll just go

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,470
to the numbers

00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:04,010
okay so what I did was expand these

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:06,500
top-level object keys and then expand

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,170
the first level sublevel keys so for

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:14,120
example natural water

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:17,390
I would expand the water values and this

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:22,700
is what came out and we have a clear

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:26,360
winner here ID has roughly two thousand

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:29,060
items chosen maybe behind that and I

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:34,220
actually ran the same program on those

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:37,430
chosen presets from 2007 which gave me a

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,070
hundred and eighty items and Vespucci is

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,230
bit better than Johnson but that's no

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:45,350
surprise because of quite a lot of work

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:49,700
into it so that's a win for ID

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:55,310
well maybe not because as I said I did

00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:57,800
pose values and keys from tag info so if

00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:02,290
you don't do that you'll get

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,290
substantially lower numbers roughly half

00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:13,430
and so you know you could argue that

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,280
this violates that I created part of

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:20,240
presets and when you're using ID you

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,890
don't actually know that this is not

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,260
something that somebody has has looked

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:29,600
at and so I say that's a bit problematic

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:33,950
but the other problem here is that okay

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:38,900
ID has 2,000 presets do they actually

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:43,880
matter and is this perhaps just okay

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:45,980
mine's longer than yours and what get

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,130
out of this program will erode to make

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:53,330
that is a big big spreadsheet with tags

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:55,070
and which ones are which preset but that

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,230
is really all the quantitative

00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:00,800
measurement and not a really quality of

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:03,260
mentioned measurement so what I did is I

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,640
had this idea let's compare this to a

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:09,079
reference and I generated this fairly

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:14,670
[Music]

00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:17,070
simple is rated overall object keys get

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:19,649
to that in a second and generator tags

00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:23,070
for all values that are used more than

00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:25,079
500 times in the database and it's

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,230
something similar for the sub keys and

00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:34,980
then I removed rubbish which is quite a

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:37,009
fair bit now what is an object key some

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,199
of you probably know that I'm in the

00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:42,269
licensed working group and we publish

00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:44,940
this collective database guideline and

00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:49,980
we actually tried to define what that is

00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:52,230
and yeah it's a long winded thing but it

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,040
points to the map features part of page

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:58,430
in the wiki and if you actually go there

00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,250
you'll get this list of top-level keys

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:04,819
and I think you know most of us would

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,949
agree these are all top-level keys

00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:09,870
support is a bit funny because support

00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:12,750
it's not really a top-level key it's

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:17,880
actually an attribute which you apply to

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:21,089
other objects and the question is

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,800
naturally are these all and for the

00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:25,920
people that were in the talk by Paul

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,760
just before this you would notice that

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,410
there's one missing

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:34,769
which one is that advertising Smitty's

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:37,220
missing any more suggestions what's

00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,220
missing

00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:51,570
exactly hmm no that's a boundary that's

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:57,640
actually a value for boundary not a key

00:14:51,570 --> 00:15:01,510
hmm yes that's not something to apply

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:05,350
for key okay a couple of more in any

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:12,400
case and so this is the list that I

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:14,650
curated symmetry interesting enough

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,200
there's one in ID which I don't actually

00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:22,210
have here that's allotment equals plot

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:25,860
that's one of these oddities but golf is

00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:31,060
for example clearly a top-level key

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:36,100
attraction playground pipeline land

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:41,290
cover and so on and so generate addthis

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:45,010
list and it contains roughly 1200

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:48,160
top-level tags and 2300 tag combinations

00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:51,420
now you have to realize that this 500

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,540
occurrences 500 slash 100 occurrence

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:58,930
occurrences criteria its relative rough

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:02,650
this is stuff which is used a lot so you

00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:08,170
would expect default preset to contain

00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:10,440
it great I didn't actually produce a

00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,730
version of this where I relaxed the

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,010
constraints a bit and said everything

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,930
that has a wiki page belongs to needs of

00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:19,120
the world and you'll get a thousand more

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,830
entries unluckily that's not a

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,220
particularly good idea because people

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:26,470
have started adding wiki pages for stuff

00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,110
that's not documented in the sense that

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:31,630
they simply add a stub which doesn't

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:35,380
actually contain any information except

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:38,620
that it's not documented so not so good

00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:41,500
criteria so I left it as it is and this

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,530
shows something interesting you can see

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:48,580
ID with tagging fo has a bit better

00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:53,160
coverage but the differences are smaller

00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:59,139
and the most notable thing is

00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:08,980
even ideal only has half of the commonly

00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:10,839
used tag combinations as presets and the

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,949
question that she is where are those

00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:18,660
missing tags I've been missing presets

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:21,819
so if you look whoops back one this is a

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:26,309
representation of the tags in in the ID

00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:30,630
preset and you can see as expected

00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:34,510
amenities large shop is large

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:38,260
that's leisure non use office and so on

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:44,140
so this is essentially preset items Pro

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:47,049
her top-level tag now if you compare

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,330
that with the reference data set you can

00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:53,610
actually see that there's one very big

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:56,650
difference and that is man-made and

00:17:53,610 --> 00:18:00,790
there are actually multiple hundreds of

00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:04,320
manmade tags in use with occurrences in

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:12,059
the thousands and thousands of objects

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:15,610
that do not turn up in the presets so

00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:20,130
you know we're obviously being rather

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:23,650
selective about what we have there now

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:29,590
generating this reference dataset had a

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:32,500
bit of problems I assumed classical osm

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:35,799
tagging so top-level key equals value

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:39,580
and the value with sub value classical

00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:42,640
example shop because closed closed has

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:47,520
two values you often will hate me for

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:53,830
this but you know it is quite common

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:59,020
this new osm tagging where valueless

00:18:53,830 --> 00:19:00,290
essentially transformed into individual

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,410
items

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:07,220
this is one which is actually fairly in

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:11,840
use and essentially these are modeled in

00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:17,000
the presets as checkboxes and we have

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:21,530
even newer osm tagging where more of the

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,750
values are moved into key space and that

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,910
actually is a problem for somebody

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,010
writing a preset it's also a data

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:32,960
retrieval program a problem but that's

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:36,440
outside of the scope of the talk so I

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:43,190
had a very funny graph here which you

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:45,140
can't see and you know this expands

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,420
forever and this is one reason why the

00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,880
the key number is so much higher than it

00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:53,150
used to be but we're moving values into

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,700
key space and we're losing the semantic

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:58,100
information there's no real way that you

00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,720
can generate a reasonable preset for

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,870
this kind of stuff and this is not just

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,730
imagined that would be a graph here

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:11,240
which showed that this actually turns up

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:13,790
in tagged info and one of the questions

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:18,680
is naturally okay can we perhaps refine

00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:21,470
things and and improve cack info use in

00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:25,010
these presets good thing about tagged

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:27,500
info is that reflects actual use it

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,360
reduces work for the developers it

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,030
allows you to discover keys that you

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,710
don't know about but the problematic

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,890
side which I already mentioned is it

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:43,400
breaks the curated assumption and this

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:45,950
limited context for that you can give in

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,320
these queries so one of the examples

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,930
that you haven't seen now is land use

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,500
equals construction construction is used

00:20:50,930 --> 00:21:00,770
as a sub tag for buildings for highways

00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:04,390
and so on and you will get all the same

00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,390
values mashed up together

00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:13,440
so one thing which I did for Vespucci

00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:17,009
finishing off now is actually generate

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,339
completely automatic generated presets

00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:22,729
and it works fairly well and then

00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:28,229
luckily I can't see show you the results

00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:31,789
but anybody who has Vespucci can try it

00:21:28,229 --> 00:21:31,789
out at least the newest version

00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:38,039
essentially it gives you a rough preset

00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:44,129
that you can actually start on and

00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:45,450
refine her hand so there are lots of

00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:48,359
other things that are interesting about

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,979
presets you know naming of them is the

00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:53,399
naming the same all over the place

00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:57,799
Deb how detailed is attacking diversity

00:21:53,399 --> 00:22:00,389
as I said we only cover half of the

00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:03,529
actual objects that are mapped in osm

00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:05,789
with presets is there any bias there

00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:08,009
then these are things that we could do

00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:13,019
in a talk which actually slug showed

00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:15,719
graphs so coming to end want to thank

00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:19,349
Johan Martin and Roland for the tools

00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:25,009
and to Tom for letting me hammered hack

00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:28,669
info for two weeks so thank you so I

00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:28,669
that we can have two

00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,870
so do we have any questions

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:59,160
do you have any idea how about how much

00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:02,880
influence the presets have on actual

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:08,430
mapping behavior well that's the graphs

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:11,400
that you didn't see and it's really

00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:14,460
totally obvious one of the examples I

00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,880
had was sculptor versus sculptor

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:22,170
that's was simply a typo in a preset and

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:25,260
you can see previously usage of the type

00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:29,340
of going up era being fixed in the

00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:33,390
preset and flattening out and and it's

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:36,030
very least for for ID where you can't

00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,340
really get around the presets it is very

00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:42,140
clear anything we put in the preset

00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,140
reflects itself in the data

00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:55,790
yeah okay for the for the man-made

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,160
problems so when I was looking into the

00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:02,650
stuff there was a lot of domain-specific

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:06,260
stuff in there especially for electrical

00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:08,360
and networks and this stuff so the

00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,010
interesting question is should this

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,810
actually go into presets or was it

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,390
better than it is outside what do you

00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,460
think about this I don't know I mean

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:19,250
there are really hundreds of manmade

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,020
tags which are not reflected in the

00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,650
presets and some of them are probably

00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:28,220
very special special purpose but there

00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:31,160
are lots of which are essentially okay

00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,810
so I I just think it's it's up in which

00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,330
we haven't so focused on people have

00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:38,000
been focusing on shops on amenities on

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:41,590
leisure tags and stuff like that and the

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,430
manmade surf has been a bit of you know

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:45,430
not so important

00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:07,200
hi it doesn't show this large version

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:12,690
yes somebody broke my SVG's I think that

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:17,000
is the problem might be Google because

00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:17,000
if you see that review yeah

00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:44,049
yeah actually I'm going to take a couple

00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:45,940
of minutes to say that during lunch you

00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:49,539
are invited to look at the bookable

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:53,169
space board to see if you want to join

00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:57,879
one of the group discussion they are in

00:25:53,169 --> 00:26:00,309
front of the registration desk then

00:25:57,879 --> 00:26:02,139
again there is the group photo after

00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:08,200
lunch at two o'clock in the central

00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:14,350
cloister there and there is also a job

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:17,879
notice board at the a community notice

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:22,350
board for job offers at the info point

00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:22,350
always at the registration desk

00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:53,270
okay ah so I can okay one graph at least

00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,760
this is the action of the sculptor

00:26:53,270 --> 00:27:00,140
versus sculpt tear problem and you can

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,420
see exactly what I say so this was going

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,720
up like mad

00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:09,110
it's actually an IDP set and I actually

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,360
told Brian about the typo here you can

00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:14,930
see wood and the correct version going

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:19,370
up errors are very good markers this

00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:29,060
kind of thing and they're a couple of

00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:33,260
examples the bracelets are very useful

00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:37,280
for nabis editor but I don't know if you

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:41,630
know easy way to make a pressure those

00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:47,120
tags for example for a mapping party to

00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:50,000
a specific team like mobility or trees

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,490
or something like that but for me like

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,630
organized mapping part is very difficult

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:59,420
to to find a know these people or the

00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:04,580
people that never use OpenStreetMap to

00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:07,700
put or to find a sack stacks yeah that's

00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,670
one reason why I think you know Johson

00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:12,070
allows additional presets and there's a

00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:14,900
hundred or so

00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,600
specialized stuff that that's somewhat

00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,610
missing the point because that is

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,970
actually only for people that know that

00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:27,110
these things exist and that's why I'm

00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:29,570
for more inclusive default presets and

00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,280
that's my for example Vespucci has a lot

00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,530
of stuff which is in seperate presets

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:39,530
for Jotham actually integrated in the

00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:41,960
default preset and and I think I think

00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,990
the the case with advertising is is

00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,929
clear you know you

00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:48,710
you don't actually know that as tagging

00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:52,679
for that object if you're a newbie and

00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:55,140
if it's not in the preset you're not

00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,910
going to be able to find it without

00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,210
knowing okay I have to go to the wiki

00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:02,640
and so on and so forth that's why I

00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:11,820
argue for for more stuff in the default

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:20,780
presets that's thanks Simon

00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:27,480
and I'm just a note opera version of the

00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:29,750
talk with the graphs online see you

00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,750
