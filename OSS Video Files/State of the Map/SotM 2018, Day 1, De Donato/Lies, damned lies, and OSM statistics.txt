When people who are unfamiliar with OpenStreetMap try to evaluate OpenStreetMap data statistically, many things can go wrong. There are just too many things you can count - how many of what are there, how richly attributed, how many contributors have added something, during what time, and what does that say about the data quality of OpenStreetMap and the interests of its contributors?

This talk aims to introduce researchers, statisticians, and data users to frequent fallacies and misrepresentations. It explains how to arrive at meaningful statements about OpenStreetMap using, among other things, Taginfo, Osmium, PostGIS, and a little bit of coding in a scripting language of the user's choice.

yeah hello everyone I'm going to talk

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,780
about statistics and liens maybe not so

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,420
much lies because a lie is always

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,460
something with a bad intention let's say

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,279
sometimes they're just misunderstandings

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,580
and also statistics is a very scientific

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,119
term maybe sometimes it's just generally

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,220
quantitative statements about mapping

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,340
I'm going to show some techniques about

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,890
how to best count things and then show

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,200
some examples you will often find

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,640
yourself wondering what is in OSM what

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,590
is it that all these mappers are

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,239
collecting what data is available and

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,079
how much of it what are these people

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:47,010
interested in you might turn to the wiki

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,230
and look at what the wiki describes the

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,829
wiki has information about all the tags

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,530
that we use when we map things here's an

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,410
example about a page about natural

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,350
equals would attack that we use for

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:06,060
generally unmaintained woodland is

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:09,000
another tag about transformers this tag

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,780
this this page is actually quite long

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,830
the transformer page may have very many

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:20,390
pictures and examples and so on and now

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,460
assume that you would like to find out

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,799
which of these is more important to the

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,600
OpenStreetMap mapping community is it

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,210
trees in the forest or is it

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,939
transformers and then you look at the

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,579
wiki and you evaluate you evaluate what

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,540
you see on the wiki let's do a quick

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,850
shootout between power equals

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,020
transformer and natural equals wood

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:48,030
which is more important in OpenStreetMap

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,290
which has more people behind it so

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,869
there's two thousand and two hundred

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,790
words on the wiki in the power equals

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,979
transformer description there's only

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,130
four hundred words for natural equals

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,079
wood there are seven additional tags

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,020
documented the decking that you can use

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,719
to further describe exactly what kind of

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,729
transformer you're looking at there's

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,590
only two additional tags documented on

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,209
the wiki page for natural equals wood

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,290
power transformer has even gone through

00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:19,910
voting process and as an approved tag

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,870
where as naturally calls what has never

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,390
been voted on

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,390
it's a rogue tag it's not approved it's

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:29,650
just been being used by some people so

00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:32,599
it's obvious power equals transformer is

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,760
much in much more has much more

00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,450
important in OpenStreetMap than natural

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,140
equals wood right this is the proof that

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,480
OpenStreetMap is a bastion of

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:46,599
electricity freaks for him trees are

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:50,959
only suitable to make power poles from

00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:52,790
or maybe not let's look at another

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,049
important page in the OpenStreetMap

00:02:52,790 --> 00:03:00,260
Universe tag info tag info tells you how

00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:02,060
many of which are there in OpenStreetMap

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,849
and which tags are often used together

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:08,150
with other tags it's daily updated it's

00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:11,420
a very very good resource tech info lets

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,790
you compare two tags directly and here's

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,850
a comparison between power equals

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:20,900
transformer and natural equals wood as

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:24,350
you can see here there are 62,000

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,799
transformers mapped in OSM there are 4.8

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,540
million objects tagged as natural equals

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,299
wood oops

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,370
maybe our initial assessment about the

00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:38,150
importance of transformers wasn't that

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:42,470
correct after all so what exactly did

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:45,470
jack info count second vote counts how

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,510
many of something there are not a total

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,049
area or a total length which might

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,489
sometimes also be interesting

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:56,000
tagging four counts OpenStreetMap

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:58,430
objects not real-world objects there

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,220
might be a large forest that is actually

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,230
mapped as three distinct areas in osm

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,810
that would then be a count of three and

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,209
tagging fo that confer counts things

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,280
that have a specific tag and that are

00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,930
currently in OpenStreetMap so it doesn't

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,319
look at the history or stuff that has

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:18,019
been there before or something

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,440
importantly tag info does not tell you

00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:23,960
how many people are actually using the

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,720
tag we have seen that there are four

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,490
point

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:33,330
million objects tagged natural equals

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:36,210
wood and 68000 attacked as a transformer

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,980
but we don't know how many people

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,960
actually are there behind this it might

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,610
be one crazy guy adding all the

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,950
transformers and everybody else not

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,040
being interested in let's have a closer

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:51,990
look and for this closer look I need to

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,990
basically leave the nice display and

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,700
switch to a shell prompt well you

00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,890
actually have to enter some commands to

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,560
find out what you want there's a very

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,270
cool utility is called osmium the

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,860
command-line utility readily readily

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,860
available under current Linux

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,450
distributions and this has a tax filter

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,790
module where I can basically say okay

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:14,490
give me everything that's called natural

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,860
equals wood from the planet file and

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:23,820
write the result in a file called wood

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:26,250
OPL OBL is a text-only format that is

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,560
used by osmium or can be written by

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,900
osmium and that is easy to process for

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,320
example I can then use the UNIX command

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:37,350
WC minus L that will tell me how many

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,810
lines there are and you see as we expect

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,550
it there are four point eight million

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,470
lines in that file because there are

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,380
four point eight million objects tagged

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:50,010
with natural equals wood let's have a

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,890
look at this file this is just the first

00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:55,460
line of it looks like this it's a bit

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:58,590
like a CSV file really it's a text file

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,410
is how different columns separated by

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,900
spaces this is the object ID in OS m

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,940
node number so-and-so version four still

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,800
visible edited in this change that

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,540
here's the timestamp here's the user ID

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,940
here's the name of the user who has

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,120
contributed the object here are the tags

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:18,930
and x and y in this case it's a node

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,419
it's relatively rare for a boot for a

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,910
forest to be tagged as a node but it can

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:28,820
happen so this is what the file looks

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:32,669
like I can now with another UNIX command

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,500
cut out the 7th column the 7th column is

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,500
this user

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,890
and I can say hey please do a unique

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,930
sorting on the username so I will see

00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,720
how many different users there are who

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,690
have actually used this tag and the

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,490
result is thirty five thousand so there

00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,470
are four point eight million objects

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,230
contributed by thirty five thousand

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:57,590
users or let's we'll come back to that

00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:00,200
item I can also with a slightly more

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,970
complicated UNIX command don't worry

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,770
these slides will be available for

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,470
downloading so you can you don't have to

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,330
jot that down now with this slightly

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,390
different UNIX command I can say show me

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,520
the five most prolific people or

00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,490
accounts we have added natural equals

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,340
would and I will find these imports a

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,350
little surprise they are all import

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,900
things like Ken vac or something

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:27,140
accounts who have like added fifty

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:30,380
thousand objects but if I if I were to

00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,840
look at the list in more detail I would

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,900
of course also find real persons who

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,240
have added that it is important to

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,720
remember that the person who has last

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,510
edited something is not necessarily the

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,880
person who first created it so it could

00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,550
be that among those thirty eight

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,740
thousand people who have last edited by

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,650
natural equals would object some of them

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,290
might have just corrected the geometry

00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,460
or something and they might not that

00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,560
they might not be the people who have

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,710
actually introduced the natural equals

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:08,900
wood tag to OS m but this is also

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:11,810
something that we can delve in deeper we

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,669
can look at the history file and we can

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,919
convert this command converts the whole

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,500
history file to an OPL file this is

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,220
going to be quite large and take a while

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:25,790
and this OPL file will then contain one

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,320
line for every historic version of an

00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,650
object even those who are meanwhile

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:33,560
deleted or overwritten by others and I

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,450
will find this line that I had before it

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,469
will be somewhere in this file but also

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:43,400
all their objects and what I can now do

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:45,030
easily if if if you are familiar with

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,220
any type of

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,350
crypting language it can be purl it can

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,300
be Python it can be JavaScript or you

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,370
can even do it in any other programming

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,390
language basically you can process this

00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:01,320
file you can look at this tags list here

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:04,680
and you can find out who was the first

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,110
person to add an or for every object

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,140
that now has a natural wood tag who was

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:13,080
the person who added that tag this is a

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,510
small Perl program that will do it but

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,480
as I said it can be done in any other

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:21,300
programming language as well and if I

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,940
run this program on the history OPL file

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,710
I will see that there are 30,000 to

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,700
different people who have actually added

00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:32,370
and natural equals wood tech as opposed

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,830
to 35,000 or or created an object with

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:38,130
that tag as opposed to 35,000 to our

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:42,210
last editors of an OS M would tag a

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:44,160
natural wood tag small distinction in

00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:48,060
this case but could be a major

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,860
distinction in other cases I can of

00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,690
course also run the program to find out

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,490
again who are the most prolific people

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:58,140
not much change here I can also do

00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,730
something what I did here is basically

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,670
if you look at this list and it

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,230
continues on and in the end of course

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,530
there will be many people who have just

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:09,870
one or two edits to a natural equals

00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:12,960
wood tag and I could run a program like

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,840
this I could I could run basically

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,120
remove every one that has just between

00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,400
one and four edits because I would say

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,520
okay those are people who are not really

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,770
prolific users of natural equals wood

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,450
they are just occasional users maybe

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,790
they just copied an object or something

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,370
so I won't count them and that would

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,470
then give me 14 thousands P 14,000

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:38,210
people who have used land use equals

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:40,680
wood five times or more frequently now

00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,940
this is all going to be very slow if you

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,140
run it in parallel on a worldwide

00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,600
database you can also do it in C++ this

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,670
is base this is a program that uses the

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,230
osmium library and does just exactly the

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,020
same thing as the Perl script I showed

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,750
you before and this will run like this

00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,550
will take maybe 20 minutes on the planet

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,150
whereas the other one will take half a

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,590
day so if you go in a little bit deeper

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,530
and are willing to write a little bit of

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:11,700
a C++ code then you can do even faster

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:14,690
statistics now wrapping up on the

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,700
transformer versus good distinction

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,530
transformer wins on the wiki it wins

00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,600
when you when you look at the number of

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,640
extra tags that are documented on the

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,990
wiki however if you look at the data

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:31,560
you'll find 4.8 million would wear vs.

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:33,630
62,000 objects French tagged as

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,730
Transformers and if you look at people

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,580
who have actually used the tag five

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,010
times or more you will find 40,000

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,840
members who've tagged a wood object and

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,940
1,000 people who have tagged a

00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:49,950
transformer object so this is basically

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:54,030
proper statistics when you want to dig

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:55,890
to the bottom of it so it's very easy to

00:11:54,030 --> 00:12:00,450
if you just have a quick look at the

00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:04,170
wiki to misinterpret things why am I

00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:09,050
saying all this it's about gender in the

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:11,100
last couple of or even years a couple of

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,040
publications have been made either

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:18,839
scholarly or journalistic where people

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:21,420
reported about in osm it looks not like

00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,570
this more like this where people

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,850
reported that our SEM has much more many

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,290
more men than women this is obviously

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,720
true I mean if you go to any

00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:34,050
OpenStreetMap meeting anywhere there

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,320
will be 10 men for every one women or

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:42,150
something and it's obviously bad I mean

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:44,130
we all know that mixed teams people from

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,410
all walks of life people from all

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,710
genders and all age groups make a much

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,930
better team to work on something like

00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:54,570
the map that we're working on then just

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,120
a group of men there's absolutely no

00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:00,120
discussion about this I'm very happy to

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,370
see many women in the audience here and

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,430
at this conference and I hope that open

00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:07,050
sheet map OpenStreetMap will go towards

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,019
achieving better

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,740
gender balance in the future however it

00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:15,750
is not easy to find something in the

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,089
data where you can actually say okay

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,800
this is obvious I can see from the data

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:24,060
in OpenStreetMap that it has been made

00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:27,029
by men and it has been tried in many

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,160
publications and sometimes the results

00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:31,920
were really really bad and people

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,860
haven't really spent any time looking at

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,800
the data for example the relatively

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,630
sexist claim has been made that women

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,730
are more interested in kindergartens and

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,560
men are more interested in spending

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,709
their free time in pubs nightclubs or

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,350
strip clubs so people have looked at the

00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:51,209
wiki and have said hey look the OSM wiki

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,339
has all these tags like amenity because

00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:56,310
pub bar nightclub strip club brothel

00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:58,110
swinger club and just one thing where

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,350
you can basically put your children

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,540
during the day it's obvious this has

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,320
been made by men right because women

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,329
wouldn't have done this in reality if

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,360
you look this is just statistics for

00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:15,360
Germany Germany has about 49,000

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,829
kindergartens at all a company over all

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:23,250
of these open treatment already has

00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:25,980
33,000 so that's about 2/3 if you look

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:29,520
at other things in Germany like pubs

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:32,329
there are 19,000 pubs mapped in Germany

00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,459
there are 6000 bars

00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:38,579
1600 nightclubs and just a tiny little

00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:42,180
like 1488 brothels

00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:46,260
strip strip clubs and so on so the total

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:48,630
number of all these things is still much

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,240
lower than the than the kindergartens in

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:54,089
OpenStreetMap so while it is true that

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,149
OpenStreetMap does have more tags about

00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:58,459
pubs and kinder pubs and strip club

00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,890
strip clubs and so on

00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:04,110
it isn't really supported by the data to

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:06,089
say well you know this this is obviously

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,470
something that men have made and they're

00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:11,790
not interested in kindergartens or

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:14,670
something tags aren't everything I said

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,000
before that the natural equals would tag

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,779
was never approved and

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,389
the transformer tag was approved much

00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:25,779
has been made in one scholarly article

00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:28,329
about their there was a proposal a

00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:30,839
couple years ago about child care and

00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:32,829
how to better map child care instead of

00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,139
classifying everything as a manatee

00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:37,000
hoots kindergarten and this proposal was

00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:39,069
discussed and was rejected in a vote

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,420
where 20 or 30 people have participated

00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:45,360
and I found this information also in in

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,740
in articles that that it's obvious

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,689
OpenStreetMap is women unfriendly and is

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,670
controlled by men because they have

00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:54,600
rejected this proposal and women are so

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:57,160
interested in childcare and men are not

00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,410
this proposal has been rejected for

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,600
formal reasons there were former

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,480
problems with it and it were there was

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,990
only 20 people or so even participating

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,910
in the discussion and as you saw before

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,639
in at least in Germany have much many

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:15,790
more kindergartens mapped than any

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,160
number of pubs and restaurants and

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,769
nightclubs and so on so even if this

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,970
proposal was rejected it hasn't kept

00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:25,959
people from actually mapping

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:29,410
kindergartens so don't reach don't read

00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:30,660
much into these into these proposals and

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,250
whether they're accepted or rejected

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,740
many of the things that we map in OSM

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:40,480
have never gone through a proposal

00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:42,160
process at all there's another in

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,309
another Journal where someone has

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,350
actually typed the word brothel in the

00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:50,439
search box in tag info and then found

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:54,910
all these tags like brothel : sauna club

00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:56,649
Bravo : club Bravo : apartment brothel

00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,540
escort services and so on like

00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,959
describing all the services that a

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,920
brothel

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,380
might offer and then they type childcare

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,929
in the box and they found only these

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:16,449
very few things and just not very many

00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:18,939
of them it's not true to deduct from

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:21,039
that that brothels are just much more

00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:24,970
interesting to open street members than

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,140
anything else I've compared the so the

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,009
same that you saw before for

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,320
transformers versus for

00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:34,500
440 words for brothels 730 for

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,509
kindergarten 16 extra tags documented

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,950
for brothers only 6 for kindergartens

00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:42,179
but if you look at the data there are

00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:44,610
worldwide 3700 brothels and 230,000

00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,559
kindergartens and if you look at how

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:49,649
many people are actually adding brothels

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,529
you'll find there's 400 people who have

00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:54,990
ever added a brothel versus 11,000 who

00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:57,029
have ever added a kindergarten and then

00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,039
if you correct if you say like I did

00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:02,549
before I only look at those who've added

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,980
5 or more of that thing there are 41

00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:07,710
people worldwide who have ever ever

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,629
added five or more brothels also these

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,519
detailed tags that you just saw before

00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:18,720
like brothel colons on our club and so

00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:21,720
on there are only 1,300 23 of them 1182

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,460
were added by the same person and only

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,009
15 other people have ever used these

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,769
tags more than twice so it's clearly a

00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:30,840
niche interest and OpenStreetMap is open

00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:33,210
to niche interests but you shouldn't

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,919
make the mistake of looking at the wiki

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,470
page or looking at tagging for and say

00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:41,879
yeah obviously this is controlled by men

00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:44,100
who think with their penis right so be

00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:47,820
careful and do some research on these

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,529
things lies I said before lies

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,330
misunderstandings sometimes it's also

00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,850
the creative omission of truths and I

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:58,940
have two more example before I close

00:18:53,850 --> 00:19:01,409
this talk one also publicized recently

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,750
the number of doctors in OpenStreetMap

00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:06,929
there are 78 thousand doctors in

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:10,200
OpenStreetMap and only 958 of them are

00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:14,129
Jaina college in neck colleges or

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:19,649
doctors for women's reproductive organs

00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:22,230
so um yes this is true it's true these

00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:24,929
are the numbers but what has been

00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,759
omitted from here is there are three

00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:29,129
thousand nine hundred and forty with a

00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:31,309
specification of general doctor and

00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:33,539
these are the next most frequent like

00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:36,659
ophthalmology that's a doctor for the

00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:38,970
eyes internal pediatrics like a

00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:41,159
children's doctor and then various other

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,099
types together make up seven thousand

00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:47,159
342 so the total statistics looks like

00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:49,229
this most of the doctors in osm do not

00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:53,220
have any specification about what they

00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:55,309
are this green block is the general

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,960
doctors and the second most frequent

00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:00,929
specification is this is a gene

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,769
ecologist in OpenStreetMap right so yes

00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:07,259
there are a few only but it is the

00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,009
second most frequent kind of doctor in

00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:10,379
OpenStreetMap

00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:12,659
and I thought this will also be true if

00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:14,249
I said the second most frequent type of

00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:14,820
doctor mapped in OpenStreetMap is a gene

00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:16,559
ecologist

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,220
that would also be true and it would

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:24,809
ring much different than this headline

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:28,830
there's one last example of 220 1923

00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:31,440
toilets in OpenStreetMap only 9000 399

00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,269
of them are for women in OpenStreetMap

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,549
you can have an extra tag you can say

00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:38,489
amenity equals toilet women equals yes

00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:41,340
men equals yes or female equals s male

00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:44,070
equals s and so on so and this is also

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,729
true this is this the exact statistics

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:51,450
but you can imagine what comes next

00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:54,239
there are also only 9,500 mapped as

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:57,119
being for men there are 18,000 mapped as

00:20:54,239 --> 00:21:00,419
unisex so the total statistics looks

00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:02,940
like this 190,000 do not have any gender

00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:05,279
specification surely this is an omission

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,859
and could be improved in the future but

00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,659
it's not really a sign that these are

00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:12,239
all like men who are not interested in

00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:14,220
in details right sort of this little

00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:16,220
thing here is the overlap between sort

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,749
of there are as I said here there are

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,789
6600 toilets who are mapped as being for

00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:22,289
women and for men which basically means

00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:24,779
it's an installation that has like two

00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:26,820
doors one for men one for men women as

00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,409
opposed to this which unisex which means

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,450
it's one installation with one door that

00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:37,979
everywhere everyone can use apologies

00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:39,720
for people of non-binary gender I for

00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:42,179
making this simple I've just talked

00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,279
about women and men OpenStreetMap of

00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:48,029
course has more complicated ways of

00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:51,869
tagging things so I've just simplified

00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:55,000
this little bit so my result of my talk

00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:56,920
bad signs don't do it

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,480
you write an article if you write a

00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,000
scholarly publication about

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,870
OpenStreetMap it is definitely true that

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,120
OpenStreetMap has mostly men as their

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:09,190
contributors it is definitely true that

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,560
we want to change this and we want to

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:15,070
improve and we want to be welcoming to

00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,570
women but looking at the wiki and saying

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,650
oh there's a lot more here about

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,990
brothels than there is about

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:23,740
kindergartens and that proves that that

00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:29,370
attempt is bad science don't do it

00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:29,370
and that's my talk thank you very much

00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,930
Thank You Frederick very interesting

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,140
presentation are there questions from

00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,140
the audience

00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,830
thank you for a very interesting talk

00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,080
how do we improve contributions to the

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:04,550
wiki so it best reflects what's in the

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,800
data can you say that again please how

00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:10,340
do we better improve what's in the wiki

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,160
so it reflects what's in the data so the

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,960
kind of level of interest in the wiki

00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,990
yeah this is always a huge discussion

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,510
about in how far the wiki actually

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:22,490
controls what's what's in the data I

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,780
think that coming back to something that

00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,960
Simon Poole has said in this

00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,330
presentation earlier today it's probably

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,270
much more what the editors have as

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:35,600
presets what controls what goes into the

00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,640
data so I think we mean why when you map

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,730
a toilet with an editor preset in all of

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,740
the all of the editors that are widely

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,270
used you will have presets where you can

00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,030
say okay is this for women is this for

00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:49,760
men what kind of toilet is this and sort

00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,920
of if you want to change stuff how its

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,720
mapped in OpenStreetMap

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,270
changing the editor presets is probably

00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:00,320
the best way to go and for influencing

00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:02,660
that yes you can add stuff to the wiki

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,880
but you as you see like they're sort of

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,550
there's a huge amount of trends

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,320
transformer specific stuff on the wiki

00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:14,600
but that doesn't make necessarily make

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:18,410
people transform on mappers thanks to

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,270
for the the talks about the gigantic

00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,679
ologist

00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:23,690
stead that you've shown what would be

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:28,100
ideal to really understand if there is a

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:31,130
gender twist is to try to find a ratio

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,559
of Gynaecologists per doctor population

00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,059
you see what I mean and that will tell

00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,840
us if there is an imbalance between

00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:41,750
because saying that a gynecologist or

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,350
the second category I think is not

00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:47,929
enough in terms of understanding of the

00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:51,559
reality you know maybe there is for

00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:54,140
example 20% of Gynaecologists in the

00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:56,590
doctor population and here in your data

00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,540
there's only like four or five percent

00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,610
represented by what I am is doing which

00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,340
would mean that there is a gender

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:07,160
imbalance or yes you're right to do this

00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:10,549
really well you would have to know the

00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:13,130
exact numbers of what type of something

00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:14,450
do exist as I did with with the

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,980
kindergarten where I said okay there are

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,590
so many in Germany and so many of these

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,780
are mapped and ideally you would have to

00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,540
know how many doctors of a certain kind

00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,970
are there in a certain country probably

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:28,730
very hard to do that worldwide but you

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:33,020
are right to get a very good idea of

00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,299
sort of if someone maps Janek Janek

00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,370
ologists how likely is it that they will

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:39,429
actually add that space that speciality

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:44,419
as opposed to if it's a period rest

00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:47,990
whatever pediatrician right sorry I just

00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:49,850
wanted to add on to that I think one

00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,950
thing that people don't understand is

00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:57,070
that OpenStreetMap is work in progress

00:25:51,950 --> 00:26:00,770
and for example in this case detailed

00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:03,110
speciality mapping for doctors is

00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,000
something new we haven't been doing that

00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:08,480
for so long and that's why there's this

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,790
gigantic number of doctors that don't

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,740
have details mapped and that you can see

00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,530
that happening all over the place and so

00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,679
that's just stepwise refinement the way

00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,419
we do it in OpenStreetMap and so people

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,840
shouldn't assume that things are steady

00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:22,840
state

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:43,250
hi thanks Frederic for the figures I was

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:47,000
about sorry yeah okay sorry I was about

00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:50,330
to make the same kind of remarks about

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,860
you are the real number for kindergarten

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:57,560
in Germany maybe you could give the real

00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:00,350
number of pubs in Germany so that we

00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:05,810
know in related because it's hard to

00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:07,700
refute that verbs are not mapped as well

00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:11,930
as kindergarten because there is less

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:15,110
verb and so it's hard to follow the

00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:17,870
logic until the end if you are talking

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,730
relative and not absolute or not

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:22,100
relative and Kanaya

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,230
it's true I was a bit I was a bit fuzzy

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,290
on that bit and I did actually try to

00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:29,690
find out the number of pubs in Germany

00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:32,920
and the only official statistics I could

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:35,750
find were combined with restaurants and

00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,460
when I when I ran the numbers on

00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,190
OpenStreetMap on combined with

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,290
restaurants I would get such huge

00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,530
numbers that the result would be

00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:48,500
basically uninteresting and I didn't

00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:50,660
find a particular number of official

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,030
number for the number of pubs but you're

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,310
right you you ideally what you would

00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:58,340
want to do is for each category of p/y

00:27:55,310 --> 00:28:00,560
how many are there in in reality and how

00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:06,080
many percent of that does OpenStreetMap

00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:07,640
already have so I was gonna ask the same

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,880
question and I found a number that's

00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:14,150
there's 33,000 which would suggest that

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,250
there hundred percent covered you found

00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,840
the number that says there's 33,000 pubs

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:23,180
in just the first resort on google it

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:26,440
was cure okay so I struggled to believe

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:29,860
that they should be 100 percent map but

00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,860
maybe they are

00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:49,750
you war it's quite possible that German

00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:57,640
men who have mapped all these pubs only

00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:59,230
turned to kindergartens afterwards we

00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,060
are running out of time so I'm sorry but

00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,650
I have to close this first talk here

00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,580
thank you again Fredrik and of course

00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,580
