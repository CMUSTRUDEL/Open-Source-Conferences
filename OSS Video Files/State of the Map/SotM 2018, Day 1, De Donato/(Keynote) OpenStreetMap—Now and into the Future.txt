The beauty of OpenStreetMap is the variety of people contributing to the tapestry of the map. Those people have different backgrounds, motivations and reasons to contribute. We have come a long way from a few people meeting in person to a global community. While OSM is unique it does have a place amongst the other projects and organizations contributing in the open space. How do we fit into this place in the future? What parts of the path must we forge on our own and which can we learn from others? Does the project have a finite life cycle? How can we as a community think strategically to ensure we remain relevant? Let’s all continue to work together, now and into the future.
