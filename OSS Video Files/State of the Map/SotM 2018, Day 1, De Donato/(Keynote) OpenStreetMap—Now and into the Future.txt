Description: 
	Kate Chapman and Heather Leson (OpenStreetMap Foundation), State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/K001-OpenStreetMap_Now_and_into_the_Future/

The beauty of OpenStreetMap is the variety of people contributing to the tapestry of the map. Those people have different backgrounds, motivations and reasons to contribute. We have come a long way from a few people meeting in person to a global community. While OSM is unique it does have a place amongst the other projects and organizations contributing in the open space. How do we fit into this place in the future? What parts of the path must we forge on our own and which can we learn from others? Does the project have a finite life cycle? How can we as a community think strategically to ensure we remain relevant? Let’s all continue to work together, now and into the future.

	00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:09,510
so my next privilege is to introduce

00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:12,150
Kate Chapman and Heather listen they're

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,309
of the OpenStreetMap foundation that

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,269
both directors if you want to come up

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,460
because I've had to point you out

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,440
because we don't want to get you mixed

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:29,070
up so this is the wonderful Heather and

00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:31,590
this is the wonderful Kate they've got

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,660
great keynote and I'm excited to hear

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,890
about now in the future and the

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:50,370
community you have a dance you promised

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:52,739
me a dance no thank you

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,050
we joked with Gregory that we needed to

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,210
be pointed out individually so that was

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,840
the beginning of our talk but that's

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,960
okay and I can't do a Maps chant either

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,659
cuz that won't be original anyway I

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,630
digress I'm very happy to be here thank

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,610
you to Wikimedia Italia for hosting as

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,159
well as all the organizers it's a real

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,990
pleasure to be at another state in the

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,330
map it's been a while for me it's been

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,470
about four years and I'm really excited

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,750
to see some old friends

00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:28,170
so the first mapper I ever met is here

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,200
today and I look forward to meeting new

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,210
friends super excited and it's also on

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,890
on YouTube and I hope that you know

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,290
we're only 400 which i think is pretty

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,939
impressive but there's thousands

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,710
millions of people who contribute to

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,840
OpenStreetMap so just in mind like we're

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,970
so massive and it's exciting to be here

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,509
with you and I hope to meet many of you

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,509
while we're here

00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:57,150
is there anyone who's here not to make a

00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:01,420
free map of the entire world

00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:03,070
so I hope that means either you don't I

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,380
hope that means that everyone's here

00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:09,990
because we have the same vision we want

00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:13,180
to free an open map of the entire world

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,710
the thing where that happens and where

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,380
we might have conflict is we don't

00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,450
always agree how to get there but I hope

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:25,300
we can have some common ground and

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:30,670
understanding on this vision so I want

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:33,310
to talk a little bit about my osm eye I

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,740
started mapping my neighborhood I come

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,600
from a GIS background and I believe

00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,600
OpenStreetMap is somewhere where we can

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,320
save the world but also you know be a

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:49,240
little goofy at the same time that's my

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:53,290
OpenStreetMap with all our individual my

00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,420
OSM's we have our OSM be it that you're

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,800
brought here from academia from

00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,170
humanitarian work

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,230
you got into mapping because you needed

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:05,040
better hiking maps whatever it is we're

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,040
here together

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:15,049
and from there we make it our own you

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,450
know I'm always impressed to look at the

00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,950
map cake wiki page because this doesn't

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,459
even cover all of it because it keeps

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,709
growing we have another anniversary

00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:27,099
coming up in August I'm hoping more of

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:30,410
you add to the map cake wiki page

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:33,080
because you know be it you're into

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:36,430
baking you're into interesting

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,590
cartography z-- you came to build a map

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,930
you like just studying the community

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:49,489
itself you find that's fascinating we

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:51,560
all make OpenStreetMap our own we even

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,390
have our own coloring book how many

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,030
other free and open projects can say

00:03:53,390 --> 00:04:01,280
that I've been wondering does the map

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:08,530
cake test work as well of your data so

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:11,540
open you can create a coloring book so

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:17,959
this is what Kate things it is not where

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:21,530
I sing but this start started as a early

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,690
morning joke the map solo but I was a

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,660
big classical music nerd in high school

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,280
I played the bassoon this is a picture

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,889
of part of a bassoon for those that

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,020
aren't familiar it's a long woodwind

00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:36,560
instrument it's kind of one of the

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,050
geekier parts of the orchestra and I

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,990
love Beethoven and I was working and I

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,910
was listening to Beethoven and what I

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,570
always loved about it was playing the

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,580
bassoon and orchestra was your the your

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:52,550
secondary so you have the flute or the

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,020
clarinet or the violin playing a melody

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,330
but then you have a counter melody

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,300
that's really supporting it and you

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,700
might not notice it immediately but

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:06,919
you'll miss it and I was thinking about

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:09,110
how that relates to mapping let's say

00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,930
you are trying to get to a restaurant

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,789
that point of interest by itself is

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,949
pretty useless you can't figure out how

00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:18,830
to get there you might not know where to

00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:21,169
park your bicycle any number of things

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,960
would make that not

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:26,120
useful experience so you need those

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,069
secondary melodies to really pull the

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,199
map together

00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:34,129
no single mapper is an island and that's

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,050
why we're so great working together to

00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:39,620
help each other out sometimes you're the

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,240
solo and sometimes you're the supporting

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:46,580
act it's still no thingy

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:53,150
I have never sung in public in my life

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:55,819
goals goals I was reading a blog post

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,819
that Richard Fairhurst to tweet it out

00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:00,800
yesterday and something he said that

00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:04,069
stuck with me is that we have to meet

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,610
people where they are and his hypothesis

00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:10,039
was a technical solution that we need

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,839
digital map tiles to help further meet

00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,669
people where they are and there's many

00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,550
other ways we need to do that be it

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:20,080
different community approaches different

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:23,270
technology how do we approach it

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,289
interestingly enough also with this

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:30,259
picture I googled open dog map which

00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:34,759
does not exist but there is a reference

00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:40,000
to it on the German forum so what about

00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:42,889
the cat I did not Google open cat map so

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,259
maybe we have more cat mappers than we

00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:51,279
have dog mappers how do we reach out to

00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:51,279
those dog mappers I have both so

00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,560
then there's the other side of keeping

00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:02,960
it all running I want to pause for a

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,659
moment and thank our sis admins and our

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,090
operation working group who moved data

00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:10,980
centers over the past week so moving

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:14,139
from London to Amsterdam no small feat

00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,139
[Music]

00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:23,519
I believe Paul Norman suggested that we

00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:26,129
were getting four gigabytes per second

00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:30,179
in the move pretty impressive

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:31,889
by van net there's other things that

00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:33,769
involve keeping it all in running and

00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,659
sometimes it can feel a little thankless

00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:39,689
the license working group coming along

00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:41,610
and helping us with gdpr compliance that

00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:44,159
these sorts of things can be a little

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:48,419
bit unexpected but we need to react to

00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:51,569
keep the it's keep things running all of

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:58,499
those things are key to the

00:07:51,569 --> 00:08:01,559
OpenStreetMap community why what are our

00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:03,599
motivations I'm sure for every

00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:05,549
individual person here you may find a

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,849
slightly different motivation there's

00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:11,819
some themes that go very much together

00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:16,169
but how you came to OpenStreetMap

00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:20,069
Ferries I was mapping mosquito breeding

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:22,529
habitats from aerial imagery when I was

00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:26,009
getting out of college and when I quit

00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:29,999
that job I swore I would never digitize

00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:33,180
anything ever ever again how's that

00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:34,669
going well fast forward six years and I

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,559
was spending most of my free time

00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,750
digitizing my first edit in

00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,209
OpenStreetMap if you go look is actually

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,319
of an island called Selden Island it's

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:46,170
in the middle of the Potomac River

00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:48,750
outside of Washington DC going back to

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,019
my mosquito digitizing it was an island

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,809
that had interesting malaria activity on

00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,699
it that we had studied back before and

00:08:54,809 --> 00:09:00,329
soon after that I began mapping my

00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:02,129
neighborhood there's many different ways

00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:05,009
beyond that you can come to

00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:09,809
OpenStreetMap you could be recruited by

00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:11,550
me as Heather was or you can come from

00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:14,220
an academic background or any other

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,439
numerous things the important thing is

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,899
we're all committed to that free world

00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:23,730
map participation we can all participate

00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,370
in different ways as well

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,350
you know because we need all those

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,510
components we all have

00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:35,460
to work together you know we're sharing

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:37,320
a map and coming to some level of

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,200
consensus and agreement can be difficult

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:47,700
at times but really I think that's our

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:52,590
passion coming out I didn't what you

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,990
have to hit enter for me Kate so often

00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,330
we focus on the fact that we are open

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,250
but we are heavy focuses on the street

00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,470
in the map and so I want to ask a couple

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,450
of questions around open first and

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,420
foremost we belong to a larger larger

00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:09,330
open ecosystem whether it be open data

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,800
I know open source or open organizations

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,350
those are our friends and allies

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,540
sometimes we belong to those communities

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,670
I came to OpenStreetMap via those

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,470
communities I worked in a tech company

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,570
where the lamp sack was part of that

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,490
work and so I know that all of us work

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,910
on different components of it but are we

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,580
open and open is a hard concept in a lot

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,170
of ways because it's asking some serious

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,870
questions about how we interact with

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,790
each other how we work and all of us

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,680
kind of thrive in terms of that because

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,770
we believe in OpenStreetMap that's why

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,360
we all are here on a hot day I can share

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,880
my family tour maybe we should do open

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,900
fan map I'm just gonna make fun of Kate

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,190
for a bit but when we think about open I

00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,560
like to think about what's happening in

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,940
a larger open ecosystem and I do that

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,680
because I think there's a lot that we

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,630
can give and share but there's a lot

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,210
that we can learn from the other open

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,860
organizations and so again I'm not just

00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,420
calling as open-source or open data I'm

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,550
thinking about other organizations that

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,110
are trying to make open powerful whether

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,990
it be open knowledge who's thinking

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,880
about open culture or as Harry works for

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,380
open corporates like there's lots of

00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,940
different kinds of open and so what are

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,700
they doing well and how can we learn

00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,860
from that so this book is free online

00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,110
they have a stack of other ones there if

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,760
you go to open-source comm they have a

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,260
bunch of articles about community

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,780
building a lot of thought thing keep

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,700
thinking about it so what is Linux doing

00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,340
some of you guys are probably part of

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,930
lugs so what can we learn from them and

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,630
how can we bring that to OpenStreetMap

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,810
and what can they learn from us so they

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:42,000
have an ambassador's network of people

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,980
who are community managers or leaders

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,810
within the open network and they did

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,900
some analysis and they started to think

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:51,210
about what was open across all open

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,280
organizations and they said okay there's

00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,870
kind of five components and so I'm gonna

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,490
break down those five components and

00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,260
then ask you some questions because I

00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,850
think each of you might have some

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,760
different versions on how are we doing

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:06,210
there when I think about Open Street Map

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,860
I want to say yes we're open and that

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,470
that's a hard thing because I think in

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,680
some ways we're open ish in some ways we

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,030
can be more open and so the thing I

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,770
learned from Frederick and I know he's

00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,150
here is that you know he's super

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,500
passionate and we're on the board

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,690
together we're super passionate about

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,400
OpenStreetMap and really fierce about

00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,230
making sure that we keep to our values

00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,910
and our principles and that people are

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,980
ambassadors all of us are ambassadors

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,710
for OpenStreetMap and he's absolutely

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,180
right we need to think about how we're

00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,970
representing OpenStreetMap and

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,880
everything we do which is a hard ask

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,310
because we're dynamic we are diverse and

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,760
everything we do so here's the five

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:47,310
values are we transparent so

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,870
everything's free online you can find it

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,300
you can look at the data you can look at

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,100
our wiki the board itself our minutes

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,770
are online you can attend our board

00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,540
meetings if you're a member of OU SMS

00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:02,580
how can we be more transparent in what

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,900
we do to inclusivity this is the hard

00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,360
one sometimes and actually

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,010
OpenStreetMaps not alone many

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,630
organizations are having some really

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,210
tough questions about how could they be

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,250
more inclusive and the exciting part is

00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,440
as I said there's people from 56

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,510
countries here right and then there's

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,720
people around the world who aren't here

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,940
who are our allies what's the average

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,730
age of the world they're in Asia and

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,040
Africa you know how many seventeen year

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,540
olds are in OpenStreetMap that's my goal

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,610
I think that's but maybe some of us

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,080
maybe some of you are seventeen if you

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,540
are come talk to me I want to know why

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,880
you're here and how we can help more so

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,530
inclusive we have the diversity mailing

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,000
list and those folks are working really

00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:45,360
hard in terms of how to make the map

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,540
data more inclusive when we think about

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,940
it adaptability

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,620
I'm trying to be adaptive but I always

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,690
want to say adaptive technology or

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,680
flexibility so you're welcome I always

00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,800
ask your friend

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,240
so are we adaptable and I don't mean

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,459
just in terms of the health of our

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,649
community or in the improvement of the

00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,360
data set I mean an understanding how

00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:10,060
OpenStreetMap fits into the larger

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,910
Internet into the larger technical

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,199
communities into other communities that

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:20,199
we can learn from like our friends at

00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:22,569
Wikimedia funny we collaborate were

00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:24,790
built on collaboration OpenStreetMap is

00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:26,560
but how might we collaborate more not

00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,170
just within our own little niche

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,709
portions of it but across that and how

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:34,420
can we be a bigger and better community

00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:36,279
that comes down to communication now

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,899
maps have always been storytelling

00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,899
devices they've always been community

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,639
centers but you know when I was at say

00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:44,199
to the map Asia I was super impressed

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,550
but all the different stuff that was

00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,860
happening there that I got to learn from

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,899
that community and I felt really sad

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,940
that I didn't know enough about that and

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:53,769
I think our story around how we can

00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,350
learn from different parts support parts

00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,120
of OpenStreetMap is the key to it but

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,519
that only comes with us negotiating a

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,589
little bit better there's lots of people

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,750
who I may agree with or disagree with

00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:05,470
but the whole point of that is to be

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,199
kind

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:10,240
I think kindness comes better and if if

00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,339
we are feeling like we're super

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,380
passionate about OpenStreetMap passions

00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:16,930
fine but if passions gonna mean rudeness

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:19,120
if it's gonna be dismissing somebody

00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,860
that's maybe something we need to work

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,519
on so how can we communicate just a

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:27,069
little bit better so I made some

00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:30,250
suggestions in terms of kind of the five

00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:32,050
things that I think makes open but your

00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,839
version of OpenStreetMap and how you

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:37,480
unite and talk about that what's your

00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,279
suggestion what do you think you want

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,920
from OpenStreetMap just just not just

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,480
now but 10 years from now so I said I'd

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,240
like to see more 17 year olds in the

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,250
room right how do we how do we make sure

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,050
that we're reaching that some of you run

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,389
mapathon with young kids I think that's

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,680
exciting I did it with 15 year olds one

00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:56,889
of the hardest things I've ever done

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,139
tension span I'm like oh well try it

00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,310
truly so what are your suggestions let's

00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,920
talk about that

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:05,380
but how can we make it even better so we

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,450
know we have the skeletons we know we

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,460
have the skeleton of what makes a good

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,500
community we know that that comes from

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,930
each other's strengths but those gaps

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,210
between it in terms of how we work and

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,550
how we might work better that's where we

00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,110
improve I'd like to see OpenStreetMap

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,610
exists in ten years whatever the

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,580
technology is around it and that's

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:32,800
because each of you is making it what it

00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:34,360
could be in the future too so how

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,290
there's offering to forward the slides

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:42,040
for me so let's build more of a culture

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,750
of gratitude other you know thank you to

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,890
the attendees thank you to the

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:50,950
organizers I also want to thank Steve

00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,450
Coast OpenStreetMap changed my life like

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,150
I wouldn't obviously be standing here

00:16:52,450 --> 00:17:00,390
without it but there's many other things

00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:03,130
[Music]

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:07,540
but building that culture of gratitude

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:10,030
it's really a two-way street when you

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,459
give thanks it makes you feel good and

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:15,250
it makes that other person feel good we

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,920
were asking a working group how we could

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,860
better help them recently and gratitude

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:25,179
was on the list of three things so let's

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:29,170
keep that in mind but please thank each

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:32,050
other if you want to go beyond thanking

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:34,750
people please support a working group

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:40,330
the working groups are what keep things

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:43,270
running today at five forty there's a

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,960
special recruitment session you can come

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:49,929
join find out what the working groups do

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,620
what skills are needed what tasks they

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:56,050
need help with and meet individuals from

00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,570
each of those working groups I hope to

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,520
see you there because this is a crucial

00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,160
component of our OpenStreetMap

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,700
infrastructure support your working

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,700
group today

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm going to invite you to talk to

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,510
strangers while you're here for the next

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,660
couple of days I know my inner

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,760
introverts that's gonna be hard but it's

00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,710
important to talk to people who may not

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,140
do the same approach to OpenStreetMap

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,840
because that's how we we work and when I

00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,270
said you're ambassadors to me you're

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,790
ambassadors for this room and how we are

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,070
online and how we interact on mailing

00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,050
lists or on the Diaries or anything we

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,630
are all ambassadors for OpenStreetMap so

00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,880
with respect we do that but you're also

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,040
ambassadors for people who are not here

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,070
so when you go home and you go to your

00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,059
meetups tell them what you learned

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,280
introduce them to the people and the

00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,059
concepts of what why why this was a

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,120
great event

00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:53,250
yalla it'll be a great event but I mean

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,350
the idea that we are ambassadors for

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,640
OpenStreetMap that is to me the most

00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,620
important thing we can do in terms of

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,120
growing OpenStreetMap and so each of us

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,580
might have a different perspective and a

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,840
different way and that's okay as long as

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,090
we're being kind to each other in that

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,010
growth as well I'd ask you to think

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,350
about and our slides cut off for some

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,230
reason but we ask you to consider

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,130
joining OpenStreetMap foundation

00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,420
OpenStreetMap foundation and the working

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,000
groups were here to try and keep the

00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,400
lights on keep it working but also your

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,679
version of what you want OpenStreetMap

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,050
to be in the future how it represents us

00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,880
as a global community what activities we

00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,830
do certainly your input in that is

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,480
important we have a booth here that

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,800
Dorothy is running with a number of

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,360
board members if you could all hold you

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,900
up your hands the board members it's me

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,120
Kate Martin yep perfect so come and talk

00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,040
to us we're very interested to hear what

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,590
your suggestions are and we're always

00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:48,450
interested to hear what you're working

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:53,040
on talk to strangers once again please

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:54,690
join the OpenStreetMap foundation that

00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,809
doesn't mean we don't care about your

00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:00,809
input if you are not a member but I just

00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:02,640
think it's it's a vital component and if

00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:04,230
you compare the number of contributors

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,280
versus the number of foundation members

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:11,850
it's a bit quite skewed so at least stop

00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,790
by and find out what it's all about so I

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:19,420
just want to echo Gregory's welcome in

00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:21,490
joining us in state of the map 2018

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,580
I want to thank you all for your

00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:27,340
wonderful individual contributions and

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:30,490
those we make as a collective thank you

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:33,310
again to our hosts and organizers it's

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,560
wonderful to be here in Milan and I hope

00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:38,020
to make lots of new friends old friends

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,470
I haven't talked to yet I'd also like to

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:43,620
see you so keep that in mind and let's

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,510
have a wonderful three days and just

00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,490
finally again because we're ambassadors

00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,410
that means we will go home and we'll

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,000
talk about OpenStreetMap and we'll talk

00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,740
about what we learned from each other

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,390
there's also state of maps around the

00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,790
world which very excited about it I want

00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:00,970
to say to the map Asia last year that's

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,410
coming up in Bangalore foss4g is coming

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,720
up in Daraa Salaam so there'll be some

00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,060
of you there perhaps but the idea of

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,950
connecting and create connecting weather

00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,720
globally or online I think is the best

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,730
power and I just want to thank all the

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,100
contributors however you contribute to

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,730
open stream app you are OpenStreetMap

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,810
thank you

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,810
