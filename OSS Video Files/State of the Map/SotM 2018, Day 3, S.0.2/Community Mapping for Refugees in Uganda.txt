Currently Uganda is hosting over 1 million refugees, of which over 900,000 are from South Sudan. Refugees are fleeing horrific human rights violations including sexual violence, torture and even death in South Sudan. Uganda has one of the most generous and progressive approaches to hosting refugees in the region, if not the world. Refugees are given relative freedom of movement, equal access to primary education, healthcare and other basic social services, and the right to work and own a business.

The local OpenStreetMap community in collaboration with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team is engaging refugees and community members in Northern Uganda to map vulnerabilities and assets in the places they live, filling in key data gaps and blank spots on OpenStreetMap in order to improve program planning and service delivery to refugee communities, develop better integration with host communities, and build refugee self-reliance through open map data

so good afternoon everyone my name is

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:13,920
Jeffrey katorga from the humanitarian

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:16,320
OpenStreetMap team and map Uganda and

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,439
I'm very happy to be able to speak to

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,949
you this afternoon about our work that

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:31,790
we are doing with refugees and the

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:35,899
community in Uganda so Uganda is

00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:41,100
renowned for its incredibly progressive

00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:44,190
policy towards refugees people say it is

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,649
one of the best in the world and I just

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,750
like to try to illustrate this how does

00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:58,260
how is the refugee policy for Refugees

00:00:51,750 --> 00:01:01,350
in Uganda so in the past year the

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:08,840
refugee population in Uganda rose from

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:12,630
about 500 to over 1.3 million refugees

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,909
so most of these refugees are coming in

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:25,080
from South Sudan possibly incidents that

00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:31,710
when the DRC Burundi Somalia and others

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:34,829
from Illyria Rhonda and you can imagine

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,350
all of these new people coming in you

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:42,030
can see the circles which show the

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:45,630
locations of refugee settlements most of

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,149
them the biggest refugee settlements in

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,479
the northern part of the country so

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,220
there we have bdbd which is the biggest

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,180
refugee settlement in the world in terms

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,659
of size

00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,520
[Music]

00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:02,100
most of these refugees that are coming

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,009
in actually most of them the biggest

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:11,360
percentage is women and children and

00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,360
these are the most vulnerable

00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:18,860
so the refugee ass thing how it works in

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,640
Uganda is that when the refugees come in

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:25,490
the integrated within the community they

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,100
can get work they can work in Uganda

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,680
freely they have freedom of movement so

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,560
someone is not reflected restricted to

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,580
the refugee settlement they can move out

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,030
and got anywhere in their country

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:44,540
the have access to social services such

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,700
as health education but when we also

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:51,080
have to realize that they are sharing

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,800
the same kind of resources with the

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,010
local people

00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,250
so doesn't mean that you can already had

00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,930
these resources in excess they were a

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:04,580
few but now about to share them with

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:08,960
this big number of people coming in when

00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:12,650
you look at Uganda's population we have

00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,390
all these youngest population of a

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,530
seventy-five eight percent of the

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:21,520
population is below the age of 30 the

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:27,280
median age right now in Uganda is

00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:30,800
fifteen point nine so we are a younger

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,540
population but that also comes with its

00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:39,890
own challenges as well as opportunities

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:43,700
so we have been doing mapping in

00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:46,070
northern Uganda and western Uganda most

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,290
of places where the refugee settlement I

00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:51,860
just give a quick example

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:56,530
Aurora district which is one of the

00:03:51,860 --> 00:04:00,080
districts hosting refugees in Uganda so

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:03,950
because when the refugees can be

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,280
integrated into the community we don't

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:11,270
just map only refugee settlements we

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,000
also have to do mapping in the hosting

00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:16,640
sub counties in places where why not

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,980
because they're sharing the same

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,970
resources so what is happening is we

00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,370
have many organizations NGOs which are

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,600
responding to the

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:32,699
the situation the leading of course is

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:36,820
UNHCR and has other partners that are

00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:40,030
implementing that projects so they come

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:43,570
in with their programs to try to respond

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:46,180
to the situation and most of big focus

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,760
much time is put in on the refugee

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,770
settlements but even the people outside

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,850
the refugee settlements why the local

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:57,720
community also need these services for

00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,740
example if someone providing water or

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,889
once to build a school

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,110
why should they beauty so our mapping

00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:08,860
what we are doing working with the

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:12,460
community working with NGOs is trying

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:16,300
also to fill the data gap so that this

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,660
information can be used to plan when

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:23,919
they are putting resources where they're

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:26,110
supposed to go so we do trainings the

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,500
picture that you see as a group of

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:33,340
community members and refugees so they

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,410
were just trying out open market which

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,330
is an open data kit which is the tool

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,430
used for food mapping for the first time

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,820
so you can see they're raising their

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:46,180
hands trying to find the GPS signal

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:51,340
because when they want to actually point

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:55,270
out where the facility is so usually

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,910
that process involves around first

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:01,330
remote mapping so we start off with

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,419
remote mapping and then we got on ground

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:07,449
and now add more auditory information so

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:11,110
very many times we put up tasks and it

00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:14,699
has court asking manager requesting

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:18,820
people to come in and help I'm not and

00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:21,039
I'd like to say thank you to the people

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:25,090
from the global sm community who

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:30,280
normally had States and help map in

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:34,150
Uganda most of the time they organize

00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,060
mapathon so this was from

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:41,500
Singh Maps mapathon in London and they

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,990
were mapping our tasks normally they

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,630
asked us to give a small presentation

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:50,290
before the mappings that so I can't say

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:54,670
one was looking at the screen trying to

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:57,760
hear about our work but other people

00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:00,010
also contribute from where they are so

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:07,240
thank you very much everyone who helped

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:11,220
to map Uganda so when we go to the part

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:17,080
of now adding things that are important

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:20,500
on the map with our surveyors we come up

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:24,040
with a data model and we're mapping

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,970
things like health facilities water

00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:31,930
points sanitation points education

00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:36,370
facilities caste based intubations and

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:38,590
other facilities so the CBI's are things

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,690
like you know when the refugees go into

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,480
the settlement also try to set up smo

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:48,580
small businesses to try to survive and

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:52,300
so we also try to map those so we picked

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:55,210
out just these things because the place

00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,460
that we're mapping was so big and also

00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,610
had to have like time limit to do it so

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:03,580
that's that was our focus and the other

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,400
thing about this data model is that we

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,160
are also partnering with organizations

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,140
yes we are working with em and we are

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,500
helping to provide them with data that

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:17,680
they need for their planning and Emani

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,230
but they also have some things that we

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,530
are most interested in and some of the

00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:26,890
things are not things that have can go

00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:28,570
on OpenStreetMap so when we develop the

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,400
data model we sometimes include the

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,970
things that are not going to

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,190
OpenStreetMap in the questionnaire again

00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:39,280
when we reach the type of data cleaning

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,930
we try to separate it to so that I was

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:45,480
going into OpenStreetMap and the data

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,480
that is going to the partners

00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:55,369
one of the challenges we faced was

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,709
mapping refugee boundaries so when you

00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:59,839
look at the open map tagging system for

00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:02,059
boundaries it's already where were

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,689
structured for administrative boundaries

00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:09,579
so country district sub counties

00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:13,519
divisions but when you come to refugee

00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:16,879
settlements is not the case any gondol

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,360
Qadam settlements not comes because of

00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:22,399
the refugee policy but people are

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,009
settled they are given land to chill and

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,449
things like that so you find a very big

00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:33,730
settlement which is subdivided into

00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:38,629
zones which are subdivided into blocks

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:41,959
which are subdivided into tanks so it's

00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:44,929
very strange that you find people using

00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:48,439
tanks for addresses in refugee

00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:52,749
settlements because what happens is when

00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:55,939
new NS are comes and put water points

00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:59,720
for people that's their address like I

00:09:55,939 --> 00:10:04,490
live in tank 14 so I find a big refugee

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:06,019
camp with around 100 tanks but each

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,269
group of people small group of people

00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:10,309
collects water from a certain water tank

00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:12,589
and that what a tank becomes the address

00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:15,050
so it tells therefore may come from tank

00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:18,350
14 so how do you put it is on

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,509
OpenStreetMap does a boundaries but what

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:24,230
administrative I mean what that I are

00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:27,319
going to you so we propose a refugee

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:30,379
camp boundary attacking proposal and we

00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:34,220
are getting good feedback from the OSM

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:36,679
community on how we can do it we're also

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:44,769
looking at already what was suggested

00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:47,629
before we do our collaborative mapping

00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,299
the lady you see burn the pictures

00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:53,240
called

00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:56,720
viola but she is refugees a refugee from

00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,310
South Sudan she worked with us to map

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,790
her settlement

00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:04,240
where she lives now because she doesn't

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,940
know it she went back her own country

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,950
the place which was new to her

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,980
apart from justice settlement she was

00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:16,700
able to also use like satellite images

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,500
to see what is around her so it's

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,990
capacity building but also it's

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,410
corroborated because in the same room we

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:27,020
have refugees a lot a refugee alongside

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,339
a community member and they are sharing

00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,790
know the same wishes and they're trying

00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:34,550
to put them on the map the adding roads

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:37,339
so we also not stop from asking them to

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:41,120
carry a phone and pick points we also

00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:45,230
give them training on how to map and we

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,510
think this also helped when they go back

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:50,210
their country at one point they can

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,570
maybe start another sm community there

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:56,960
and also we try to bring them on the

00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:59,630
same table we even the NGO also when we

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,820
did training bring everyone in the same

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:08,440
place and talk about sharing data

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:12,170
because some of these organizations that

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,700
respond to the refugees do data

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,390
collection of their own

00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:19,130
so you find everyone collecting data but

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,930
they're not sharing so one of the things

00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,050
we're trying to do is share em

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,700
OpenStreetMap as a way of sharing data

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:29,120
because if everyone is collecting data

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:36,160
on water points why not one person

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:40,510
collecting the data and then share so

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:44,390
when when we go down to the communities

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:47,120
we try by starting with a basic map so

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,339
it print the map as it is blanked and

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,010
then ask people what information would

00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:55,580
you like to add to this map can you

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:59,480
locate your village so I try also to you

00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:01,430
know get people to appreciate what a map

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,209
is and that they can make this change

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:07,370
and make an improved map of the area so

00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:09,680
here people we are getting peppers and

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,550
pointing out places where they say

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:17,420
before actually going

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:21,300
and adding information on the map and

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:23,640
then the other thing that we use aboard

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,270
aboard us so boda-bodas in Uganda a

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,440
motorcycles public transports called

00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,470
Bora Bora

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:36,410
so this but about as what they help us

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:38,220
is to do also a community knowledge

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,860
because they already know how these

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,230
places are and some of the people we are

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,000
working with are refugees who are new in

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:49,550
the area sometimes they don't know even

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,090
the local language so we engage motor

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:59,430
cycle cyclists who do public transport

00:13:54,090 --> 00:14:01,460
so we pair them up severe was we refer a

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,650
motorcycle person and they drive around

00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:08,010
stop at a school repeat stop at a water

00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:12,540
point not it stop at a health facility

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:14,760
map it so the the badabada cycle is give

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:18,180
us local knowledge because they already

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,520
know the network of the place and also

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:23,540
they help to do the community entry for

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:27,120
the refugee where he would always find

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,070
challenge so here the death studying of

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,800
fair day under the trying to rattle is

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:34,170
okay I'm going to this parish that's how

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,690
many villages how do we so they make the

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:43,230
plan together well then they head out

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:46,170
and do they favored mapping some of them

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:49,800
have to specify his challenges in the

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:53,640
field for example magia had to cross a

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:56,690
river so the place where the refugees is

00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,920
just one that was so brave on Nile and

00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,560
sometimes reached the other village

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,070
someone has to cross a river so enough

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,230
cross with the motorbike so if this is a

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,180
refugee who doesn't know the place and

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:13,470
has to cross a river to go the other

00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:17,510
side to do mapping it will be very hard

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,510
without this motorcycle side forests

00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:26,140
yeah the hacking that we have to do is

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:29,649
also to try to find the way for people

00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:32,830
to change phones because you know the

00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:35,430
GPS drains a lot of battery if you are

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:39,310
going to move around the whole day

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:41,380
collecting better then the battery is

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,560
going to run down in you know three

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:47,459
hours and you have to map for maybe six

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,350
hours so what we try to do is to connect

00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:53,070
the charger to the batch of the

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:58,000
motorcycles as someone is moving around

00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:59,560
is charging so that's some of the things

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,810
we have to do to overcome some of the

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:08,050
challenges we face in the field this is

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:10,570
these are the DP extracts from our

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:14,050
surveyors as they moved around the whole

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:16,600
district and we can see from the colors

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:20,620
they speed whether we are moving fast

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,320
and where they're moving so so we do we

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,920
use this data to improve the road

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:30,580
network we created a task and asked

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:34,870
people to help use this to convert data

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:37,450
into into roads so taps are sort of our

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:40,450
monitoring of the work as they are doing

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,820
the work to know which places we are

00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:45,370
possibly missed out if they're not

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,959
trucks here what does it mean does it

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:51,940
mean they're no facilities where does it

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:55,360
mean no one went there so we collect the

00:16:51,940 --> 00:17:00,700
Pips trucks as well as using the or DKIM

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,320
care to collect the information this is

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,110
just to show you some of the facilities

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,589
that are found there so these are two

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:10,929
water points this is the water point in

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:16,959
a refugee settlement under one is a

00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:21,390
water point in the community but the

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:24,040
question is who ever the tree is bata

00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:26,199
the other lady doesn't have safe water

00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,960
but this one also has to line up for the

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,980
whole day to be able to access water so

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,160
if a cities are not enough

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,860
if an organization is responding to this

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,549
you want to know each of these points

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:43,970
and what the attributes are how many

00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:45,590
people are accessing this in a day the

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:51,230
rest of the some of the information we

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:53,510
try to collect this is a kiosk a

00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:58,040
smoker's a business set up by refugees

00:17:53,510 --> 00:18:03,980
in the settlement to try to survive so

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:06,790
also map this kind of things and then

00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:11,090
when it comes to giving feedback to the

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:14,809
NGOs and and government we make

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:17,270
interactive maps to answer simple

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:19,520
questions like in the whole settlement

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,640
so this is rhinocam sub refugee

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,640
settlement so you give information like

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,960
which water points are working and which

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,270
ones are not working so that because the

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,490
vanna's and have resources to respond to

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,770
this we give them the information and

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:41,840
then they respond and solve that problem

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:44,240
we also make printed maps for example

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,590
this one we did it for our World Food

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,900
Program so the 1/2 points where they

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:54,679
distribute food it is also important to

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:59,290
put the distribution points in places

00:18:54,679 --> 00:19:02,630
where where they're mostly needed so we

00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,880
get like population data using the

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:10,610
building footprint and also show the

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:13,070
location of for distribution points so

00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:17,230
like I said we are using odd DK to

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:21,650
collect data and we use what's up a lot

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:25,059
so to get feedback from the surveyors as

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:27,440
the out there collecting their data

00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:29,740
although now we have to change to

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,900
something maybe like telegram because

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:36,230
the government has just put tacks on

00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:41,750
what's up so use what's up on your task

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:43,730
text so I'll find a solution after

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:48,410
collecting this data

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:51,230
it is put it on the or DK server and

00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:54,410
then that's why we pick it from clean it

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:58,730
up before going to OpenStreetMap so we

00:19:54,410 --> 00:20:01,480
have a data cleaning pipeline like I

00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:04,760
said we collect also data that is for

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,470
NGO that's not going tourism so part of

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,610
our data cleaning process is also to

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:12,590
separated too so that we have that

00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:15,140
others ending up in OpenStreetMap and

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,990
has been cleaned all the tagging has

00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:22,850
been verified that is fine before it

00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:26,870
ends up into OpenStreetMap we also do to

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:29,570
airport assurance to make sure that the

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,890
data that we are collecting is good

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:36,640
so having terminal violation by our team

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:41,600
but also for things like remote mapping

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:45,290
we based on crowd-sourced information to

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,840
you know to get help from the globalism

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,100
community so very many people and

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,180
validation Friday

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:57,430
let's run by the missing maps they come

00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,430
in and help validate the information

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,950
interagency coordination in the picture

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,970
now left

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:09,670
that's community member a refugee and an

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:13,510
mg or visa on the same table doing

00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:16,190
OpenStreetMap so a lot of trainings and

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:20,420
enjoy support for all of these kind of

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:23,390
organizations this is government we also

00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,590
a training government this is the grand

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:28,250
a Bureau of Statistics

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,990
so we are doing community noise I'm

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:34,010
training with them and actually they

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:37,670
would like to use OpenStreetMap for the

00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:39,500
upcoming census the next census so

00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,930
that's a discussion we are having with

00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,820
them so so so helping us the projects of

00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:48,920
for helping us to promote OpenStreetMap

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:50,930
to government and other organizations we

00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,600
are printed maps

00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:56,840
so that's imagine a sub current or visa

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,370
who serves a lot of people by doesn't

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,760
have a

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:03,430
map in their office so for the first

00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,710
time we are giving them maps but they're

00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,140
putting in the offices and these maps

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:10,840
have been the database on the map has

00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,960
been collected by their own people in

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,030
their own community so they are reaching

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,730
out to those as well the another thing

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:21,100
we are doing is also are creating the

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,410
map as of tomorrow so we are going

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,040
beyond the universities we are also

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:29,500
reaching out to secondary schools and

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,990
showing them OpenStreetMap and they are

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,540
picking interests okay of course the

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:38,470
challenge is we go to school and they

00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:41,890
don't have devices to carry this on but

00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:45,370
we like it to have got participated in

00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:48,340
the net Hope grant devices that was

00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:54,880
through heart where we can use these

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:57,550
devices to help run such trainings the

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,280
other thing that is so good is that the

00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:04,000
hot presence in Uganda is also helping

00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:07,450
to grow the OSM community the Localism

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,900
community so in the three years that

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,550
what has worked in Uganda has helped to

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:17,410
strengthen and grow the Localism

00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:20,130
community right now have map Uganda

00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:22,720
which is an NGO or a local NGO

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,870
non-for-profit which has been now

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,840
registered and can now also grow its own

00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:31,210
activities around OpenStreetMap we are

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,370
also happy to say we the country with

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:40,490
the biggest number of mappers chapters

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:43,010
in the world eight and yeah

00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:44,660
a few other countries are trying to

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:47,240
challenge us but we are not going to

00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:51,350
allow them shall remain on top they are

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:55,330
opening up new ones very fast but also

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:58,160
we we are trying to grow the network of

00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:59,210
OpenStreetMap around the whole of Africa

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,500
so we are getting in touch with

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,200
different

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:06,200
osm communities from all over Africa and

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,600
we are trying to work together to share

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,660
resources learn from each other

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,900
success challenges and and grow the

00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:20,600
community one of the things we want to

00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:24,200
do is also to make sure that they all

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:27,160
become local chapters the organizer of

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:36,440
the map Africa Alaska is coming back in

00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:37,790
2019 yo welcome to Africa so with that

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,460
we are trying to put Cornetto

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:47,650
collaboration and also showcase the

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:50,330
possibilities of OpenStreetMap we had

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:53,630
soccer at openstreetmap instead of the

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:56,900
map Africa and from the the team on the

00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:59,590
right is Uganda Tim on the left is the

00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,149
rest of the world

00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:07,480
do you want to know the result of that

00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:11,470
game so the result was too new in the

00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,990
favor of the whole world against Uganda

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:19,149
but it was good because for community

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:23,350
building so it was a social event this

00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:25,990
is our team the small team in Uganda but

00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,399
the people who are doing this wonderful

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,639
work so I just want to say thank you to

00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:34,840
them and that's it from me

00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:38,230
thank you very much thank you very much

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,950
John please give some water some

00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,950
question for you

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,940
I had a question around with the

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,400
refugees so you're mapping the the

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,410
communities in Uganda but are you also

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,410
thinking about mapping with the South

00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:01,810
Sudanese mainly I think refugees to map

00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:05,740
the villages back into South Sudan

00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:07,420
because it is for us yeah international

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,140
humanitarian organization is really

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,300
incredible

00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,790
useful information if they could point

00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,710
the name of their village on the map

00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,300
inside - dammit and if they could point

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,310
even more like the health centers at the

00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,880
school that would be incredibly

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:25,990
incredibly useful information all right

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:28,090
hmm yeah thank you so much sure he I

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,890
think that's very very good suggestion

00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:32,800
we were thinking that these refugees

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,150
when they go but they can start a same

00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,790
committee but I think we don't have to

00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:39,070
wait until they go back we can engage

00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:41,350
them and ask them to map places where

00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,190
they came from so thank you very much

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,190
that's a very good comment

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,570
you mentioned that what's up has attacks

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,450
from the government how does it how can

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:09,419
they do it manually how does it get

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:12,090
implemented how does it how do they tax

00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,679
what's up on occasion or was it a joke

00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:16,669
no it's not a joke

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,679
it's just came out like a month ago so

00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:22,200
here I'm using whatsapp and Facebook

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:27,299
freely when I go back to my country I

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:30,990
can't have to fast pay tax so so how do

00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:34,740
they charge it so I think they block you

00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:37,789
three oh the network service provider so

00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:41,669
they worked with the telecom companies

00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:44,100
to make sure people pay the tax so you

00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:53,669
paid a telecom company the tax before

00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:56,220
you access the service if there are no

00:27:53,669 --> 00:28:00,409
questions thanks you're faking it yeah I

00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:03,960
just want to say that we publishing and
