OSM is becoming a more and more important instrument for individuals and enterprises to achieve independency from private spatial data and map providers. Web enterprises can play a big role in enhancing and contributing to OSM, because they not only have great interest in exploiting open geo-data but also in investing capitals to keep OSM up to date. This case study deals with the issue of merging private and public changes, validating public OSM daily diffs to avoid importing harmful changes and to create beautiful enterprise multi-language and multi-style maps. In order to achieve such results, some issues have been addressed, such as the problem of syncing private and public changes, the heuristics used to monitor every incoming change, which lead to the possibility of applying machine learning techniques and algorithms to get a more advanced and efficient validation process.

good morning I'm Jack Aperta

00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:12,469
from mobile shadow type the Maps team

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,289
I'll be talking about how and why we

00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:18,980
realize that our map system bases the

00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:21,800
novel Street map I'll be talking about

00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,650
our experience starting from the

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,240
opposite direction we took first of all

00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:31,130
also stream Maps is not always bad idea

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,739
if you need just a quick and easy

00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,840
solution that is useful for the common

00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:40,850
needs for the common tasks of your

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,890
business and if you may pay for these

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,130
services for example if you have a

00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,649
restaurant I just want to tell your

00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:51,950
customers where where the you are you

00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:53,090
are your restaurant is located well oh

00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,070
wow

00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,620
you definitely maybe don't need or the

00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:03,200
street map basically maps so we can

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:05,180
forgive you but in general what if you

00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,250
have a problem and no one else can help

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,799
you what if you need a particular

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,790
solution what if you are low in budget

00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,710
and want to look for something that

00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:19,580
other providers doesn't don't offer to

00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:23,860
you well then you should build a team

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:29,030
that have the competencies and skills

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:31,850
that can help you building a particular

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:36,140
solution more readable for your for your

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:39,170
business most important thing this

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:43,939
solution could be can be built entirely

00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:46,250
with open source software instruments so

00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:51,619
this team may really help your business

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:54,890
going on what kind of advantages can you

00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:57,860
have from this team a strong

00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:00,350
customization because having the right

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,439
data and the right competencies you have

00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:07,009
you you may style your data toward your

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,349
business and to obtain beautiful maps to

00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,989
build the services useful for your

00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:15,959
business you may get a cheaper solution

00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:21,030
because you don't have to pay any more

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:26,969
periodic fees too expensive private

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:28,319
providers you can anyway you can get

00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:31,260
beautiful maps with your eye

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,840
competencies you more important what's

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,019
important thing you can realize your

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,480
plans we are not only talking about maps

00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:43,819
you can realize your project you can

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:47,189
extract what you need ok so you can

00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:50,430
replace the existing services you had

00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:53,419
from the preceding providers and create

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,639
your future solutions and new services

00:02:53,419 --> 00:03:00,719
so you can realize create your plans you

00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:04,950
realize them obviously you have to

00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:10,109
address some issues initial investment

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:12,359
you have to to get servers databases you

00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:15,090
have to get a reliable broadband

00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:17,609
connection you have to acquire do you

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,569
know how the competencies in order to

00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:24,030
realize such a project such a system you

00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:27,299
have to substained integration

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,989
substitution costs and you to provide

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:34,079
yourself the maintenance of your map

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:40,849
system because yet it has to be reliable

00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:44,400
efficient up-to-date and correct so

00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:47,040
modern is you have to make such a

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,180
replacement of the old system of the old

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,840
provided the own services provided by

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,459
private providers with your own system

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,229
you have to make this replacement as

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:03,389
transparent as possible for your

00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:05,669
existing system so the solutions may may

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:08,220
not be out of the box solution so you

00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:13,290
may need an adapter to make this process

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:17,310
as transparent as possible so only your

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,409
choice because you have to you have to

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:25,279
ponder all these all these of these

00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:27,779
points and choose which way to take ok

00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,139
let's suppose we want to follow the

00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,139
white wrap

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,500
these are the main steps we are to pass

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,169
through first year we have to choose

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,210
that there right infrastructure we have

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:42,190
to provide the right customization most

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,250
readable the the most readable for our

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:49,800
for our business and we have to provide

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,800
the maintenance and update of our system

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:59,370
at the very beginning of our our project

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,590
this is the stack we we have based our

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,260
system on this is maybe one of the most

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,700
well spread stack use it for creating

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:11,970
maps based on office treatment

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:15,340
something from my post Caskey where data

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:18,430
information affected by rendering engine

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,770
based on ethnic with the cache to speed

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,490
up the rendering and then tides are

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:30,669
provided to just keep science in order

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:33,600
to be used by the two to create the maps

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:36,669
the browsable maps or the static images

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,050
the important important is that all the

00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:47,950
elements in this stack open-source

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:51,550
instruments well then we have to think

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:54,970
about the customization of our maps this

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,460
is process based on two steps the top

00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,710
extraction and styling data extracting

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:04,090
data we have to choose what to represent

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:07,000
on our maps and selling data tells us

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,550
how to visualize those information on

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,070
the map

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,410
these two steps should always be focus

00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:18,130
it on our business because we have to

00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:21,370
create a map helping our business so we

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:27,190
have to maybe reduce the information in

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:30,580
order to keep the map as usable as

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:33,370
possible from the from our clients from

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,669
our customers so as you may see this may

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,370
be this may this may make a big

00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:42,930
difference between maps originated from

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,930
the same source of a street map

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:51,620
as most of you may know of a signal

00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:54,750
rendering database schema is based on

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:59,550
substantially three kinds of features

00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:01,950
points lines and polygons and these

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,890
kinds of features are always

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:07,680
characterized by their tags defining

00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:11,130
their properties their attributes so a

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,370
point can be a subway station a line can

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:17,880
be a motorway or polygon maybe a tourist

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,680
just the system takes the information

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,660
about what we want to extract and

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,740
flatten this information in order to

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:29,730
realize the map this is very important

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,710
in the in the part about the maintenance

00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,580
and update of the map because obvious

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,750
with map offer has a great opportunity

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,780
giving us the possibility to choose

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:43,110
between day hour and minute leaves in a

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:53,850
way a huge degree of freedom in organize

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:56,580
our update tasks well is everything is

00:07:53,850 --> 00:08:01,980
are all the data imported by opposite

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:05,160
map correct we wish we hope the rest of

00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:12,870
the information coming from a state map

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:16,590
but we have to check them we make some

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:20,250
some controls on data focus it on our

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:25,020
business so we our business is real

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:29,900
estate so for example we can check if a

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:33,120
building is being moved or changes shape

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:36,660
or for example if the name of a street

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,180
or of a town or a neighbourhood of a

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:44,420
town the little town like this case has

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:47,970
been removed so we we make some changes

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,520
in well focus on our business we don't

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:54,050
we don't control everything but we make

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,050
changes focuses on our business

00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:02,680
a part of the game we can we can make

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,260
mistakes but in this case this was not

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,089
our mistakes obviously this is also

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:15,400
something difficult to to check an

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:20,320
online magazine refuses they the the

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:24,670
news that by telling that we have

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:28,510
classified super Bernier genoise like

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:32,500
bronx it this was was never be not our

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:34,570
fault but the online magazine say

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,410
something like this

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:42,820
we have correct we have fixed this such

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:46,000
an error on the map but the positive

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:52,390
side of such a new is that your line

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:55,029
magazine new that we add our own maps so

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,330
this there is a little positive side in

00:09:55,029 --> 00:10:07,510
this new so maybe you are we are doing a

00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:09,730
good work maybe well it's beautiful to

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:13,570
use of a street map but obviously pop

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:16,000
have to be has to be sustainable we have

00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:20,320
to contribute to a sleeper to continue

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,470
using of a street map we have a policy

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:29,740
of public private contributions public

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:34,810
contributions consist of changes we

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:38,260
apply to our maps that we then apply to

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:41,620
a basic map tool so these changes are

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:44,529
visible on both the system's private

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:50,350
contributions are changes we apply to

00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:53,740
our system but not to a street map not

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:56,470
at once at least what does it mean and

00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:00,839
the typical example is the example of

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:04,390
the new buildings if a customer of ours

00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,080
in real estate agency for example tells

00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:09,290
us that in a green area

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:13,730
is going to be built we'll build a new

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,130
building okay we can add this element if

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,990
you if you know for example the the base

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,360
shape or something some other

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,820
information I ate or if there are

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,760
boundaries around we can add this

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,550
information to our map but it's not

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,340
corrected to add this information to a

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,260
street map for our interest because this

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:38,810
building is going to be realizing in two

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:41,960
years so open signal users could be in

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:46,790
that area and see a group of sheep and

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:49,430
nothing else but maybe when they're

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,470
building Israel I said if not add other

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,350
users have already added the delay

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,230
element the public map of a signal then

00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:03,800
we push our data of a street map to make

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:05,780
it publicly this has advantages so we

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,840
can add the data of interest for our

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,970
business to to the map and we are

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:17,000
infinite protection against armful

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:18,650
changes we we can keep some element of

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,730
interest for us for example the new

00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:26,900
building protected and no other users

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:29,540
can change it until we make it public of

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:34,060
course we please make the system more

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:37,550
complex how does it work in basically

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:44,900
given the fact that we can have a map DB

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:46,580
with public and private changes we we

00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,930
have to we have to pay attention at the

00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,230
fact that of a street map uses

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:53,960
sequential IDs first of all we drop

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:58,640
these changes in true dumps separate

00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:02,150
separating private the public changes we

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:08,000
then push public change its of a street

00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:10,550
map we then get back public changes from

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:18,830
mobile Street not to true the import of

00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:19,810
dips and then we reapply our changes in

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:25,740
order to over

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:29,290
right our changes to eventually do

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,180
changes done by other users maybe on

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,240
elements we modified in our budget

00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,520
changes at the end our change our

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,770
changes have to win over the others

00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:46,500
because we have visited the rest as a

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:56,200
Enterprise so in our in our experience

00:13:46,500 --> 00:14:00,760
so far we are able to serve here nine

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:04,810
partners reality so far seven partners

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:07,870
across Europe we can serve 15 million

00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:11,980
tiles they with different styles and

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:15,850
different languages this is helping a

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:20,260
lot of our business but we also have

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:23,320
future plans so the first the first

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:26,380
group of points we have replaced the

00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,260
existing maps the service and now we

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:32,740
have future plans for our projects we

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:35,710
want to work with better tiles 3d layers

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:39,630
and of course improve validation is

00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:44,740
fundamental and this is more important

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:48,700
these three points mean that we can

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:51,610
create our plans as I said before we can

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:54,670
develop our ideas we can think of

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:58,839
services that cold help our business to

00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:08,550
to grow up and we can build with the

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:11,589
services so let's we have to consider if

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:16,450
which Thomas treatment can help our

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:22,480
business we have to know that Russ there

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:26,320
are issues to address especially at the

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,380
beginning to build this map system to

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:34,180
replace the old one

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:40,930
and very important we have to support of

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:43,690
a street map as an enterprise we make

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:47,170
even more than a single community member

00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:51,490
we can help of a street map to grow a

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:54,399
lot so this is a responsibility for us

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:59,380
as an enterprise to use of a street map

00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:01,420
to make it possible to to to spread the

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,690
information of a strip up is a valid

00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:08,130
instrument to build maps but we have the

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:14,110
responsibility to contribute towards it

00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:18,069
also in the validation process we can

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:22,209
make a lot as an enterprise we

00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:26,019
contribute to opposite but because it's

00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:30,910
something like planting trees in a park

00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:38,170
we are going to have fun thank you very

00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:42,149
much Thank You Andrea for the nice dogs

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,149
there are any question from the public

00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:53,200
I have two questions so related to the

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:56,680
public-private changes point that you

00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,440
made so could you share what kind of

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,730
private changes you know you make on

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,949
your side and the second question is so

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,260
you mentioned that you merge public and

00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:10,689
private or you know the centerfolds

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,689
question so my question is you mentioned

00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:15,939
public changes and private changes so

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:20,290
could you share what kind of private

00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:23,040
changes do you make on your side if I

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:26,110
can if I can share the private changes

00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,419
what I mean is like just share like what

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:32,380
type you for example add new buildings

00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:35,230
do you add like you know you know Road

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:40,809
building shapes do you add intersections

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:43,030
I'm just curious what oh right right I

00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:47,830
the information we are going to apply to

00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:50,140
our Maps but not at once on a signal for

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:53,559
example new buildings not still realize

00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,960
it in reality but it is not because it's

00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,720
not correct to put on another Street

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:02,260
proper information that is something

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,250
that doesn't exist actually so this is

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:10,270
the kind of information I call private

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:12,669
and so later on after let's say you know

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,590
you have this and the next time maybe

00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:16,929
somebody else has also added this

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,970
information yeah maybe in a slightly

00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:21,220
different way like maybe your Road

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,960
building shape looks like this they're

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,679
building shape looks like slightly like

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,600
this then how do you decide which one is

00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:30,970
correct like should you keep your

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,600
version or should you keep like a

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:40,090
different version if I if I understand

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,540
the question if I have a building the

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,620
PISA

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:48,400
and that as a private change by eyes and

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:51,220
these if this building has been modified

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,809
by someone else on OpenStreetMap and we

00:18:51,220 --> 00:19:02,619
import our changes for our business

00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:06,429
interest always to win over obviously

00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:10,450
if we have modified this building the we

00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:17,379
know that this building is done in a

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:20,440
certain way so until this visa change it

00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:26,019
on this building is marketed as private

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:28,359
by us our changes we always win on

00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:34,690
public changes thank you

00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:36,669
the question I am Italian so I know very

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,429
well the situation of the covariance of

00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:41,889
opus 312 Italy and if you go in South

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:43,749
Italy for example Calabria there is

00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:46,059
noting or there are the roads without

00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:47,859
names a building is now are not present

00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,779
some village have to be than the other

00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:53,919
or you solve it in the places where is

00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:55,809
nothing you saw are you sure your map

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,080
there is noting or you can use the map

00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:05,219
if there is not enough no that means we

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:09,460
we are we have we live on the

00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:12,399
notifications of our customers real

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:15,879
estate agencies typically so if an

00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:19,269
agency knows that some other some

00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:25,269
customer of itself have buildings to

00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:30,969
rent or to be said in people chases in

00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:36,190
that zone they notify us the situation

00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:39,280
and with our editing team we are going

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:42,520
to modify that zone to see from

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:48,910
aerial images under the out on our a

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:55,360
living tools then we update images and

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:58,360
we go to we navigate that zone and try

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:02,350
to define these buildings and then push

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:06,750
this modification as private or public

00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:13,990
contour estate not or power system the

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:16,690
names of the street we also take this

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,610
information off from the agency if the

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:21,550
agency can give this information because

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:24,190
if the agency tells us that the customer

00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:28,570
want to sell the building also will give

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:32,470
such information about the the zone

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:37,540
around the building so we can map zone

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:46,000
by zone on the news coming from our

00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:48,610
customers hi can you please tell us more

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,410
about the kind of validation you do on

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:54,250
open street one day a time before

00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:58,720
importing your platform if we do

00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:01,810
validation what kind of body betray our

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,780
validation process is composited by two

00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:10,500
steps first of all every time we

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:16,690
imported if we check relevant changes

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:22,750
for example if the name of a Subaru has

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:25,660
been moved far away from the initial

00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:29,260
location or for example if a street has

00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:37,570
been changed an irrelevant manner from

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:40,030
its original position then we make a raw

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:43,240
validation for so far because we though

00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:47,140
we do based on this relevant changes a

00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,570
pixel-by-pixel comparison on the between

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,670
the SES status of the production

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:57,050
database

00:22:51,670 --> 00:23:01,940
the future status that the system will

00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:05,380
will take if the if the difficulty be

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:10,340
applied in production and so we we can

00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:14,060
we can check the correctness of the of

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:17,840
the of the the change but we are going

00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:20,360
to to improve the our validation process

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,690
because because this is a simple fixed

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:27,710
by 50 Excel comparison and we would like

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:32,530
to make it this little bit smarter maybe

00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:44,510
adding some machine learning algorithms

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:48,200
from our poly assurance team so you said

00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:51,380
about it's good for companies that use I

00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,260
the switch type in Street Map also

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:57,050
support OpenStreetMap and you said that

00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,870
by kind of making contributions to

00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:02,870
OpenStreetMap but there are other ways

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:05,420
you can support it so I want to thank

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,520
you for sponsoring open one of the

00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,520
sponsors of the conference but I

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,020
wondered if you're supporting

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,740
OpenStreetMap in other ways such as

00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:18,620
going to local events or maybe helping

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,600
the local community with any you know

00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,880
they have a lot of volunteers and if you

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,270
help with any time or tasks that they do

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:30,140
or other support that I haven't or we

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:39,050
are using open so we are using web-based

00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:42,670
maps from June 2017 so it's just one

00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:46,010
year so far our contribution is to

00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:50,650
validate data and correct data on our

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:53,840
system and all of a street map and to

00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:57,560
apply our validation process City that

00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:01,060
is quite true so far but we can help in

00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:04,280
this way for the future of course we can

00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:07,010
we can develop approach other projects

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,350
to support this visit this platform

00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:13,300
because it's very important for us that

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:18,770
opposite map could and live and prosper

00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:21,110
we have time for the last questions the

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:24,260
model how you upload to Open Street Map

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:26,840
seems a little bit strange for me have

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,450
you ever discussed this online with the

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,630
community the model how you upload to

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:38,120
osm with private and not private and so

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:43,690
on we upload modifications to the users

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:49,640
of the api's and we discriminate between

00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:52,810
private if I understand the question we

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:56,600
discriminate between private and public

00:25:52,810 --> 00:26:00,680
changes we do by the use of internal

00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:05,960
tags internal to our system so if a

00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:10,430
member of our editing team marks the

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:13,420
change is adding a particular tag we

00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:17,510
know in our periodic process of

00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:20,630
application that this element should be

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,320
should go in the private dump or in the

00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,780
public dump

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,480
would be push it only to our to know if

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:29,810
it should be push it only to our system

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,520
or to of a street map - and we know I

00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:36,080
don't didn't understand the question

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,570
maybe you can have okay conversation so

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,460
