We present one of our latest mapping projects in Belgium to map all the roads. We present the goals of the project: a verified, quality checked and complete road network in Belgium in OSM in a sustainable way. We will bore you with some of the tech details next, like minutely checks of the latest changes and scaling to the entire planet, before moving to talk about integrating open-data into OSM in a way that potentially involves everyone in our community. Last but not least we talk about the relationship we (want to) have with all relevant authorative datasets and touch on how machine learning fits into this idea.

More information about our project can be found on the Belgian OSM website: http://www.osm.be/2017/01/06/en-project-road-completion.html

good morning everyone thank you for

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:13,309
attending this morning session the talk

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:16,020
is by pan up a thousand welcome and

00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:18,240
Michael's rod competitors in Belgium

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,789
mapping and verifying all the roles so

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,910
please yes

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:28,400
so allo good morning everyone welcome

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:31,949
well thank you for showing up this early

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,200
so I'm going to talk about mapping and

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,210
verifying all the roads in Belgium so

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,400
let's start with why we are doing this

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,160
so sweet map is about mapping the world

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,750
guess we can all agree on that subject

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,520
so and let's look at the state of the

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,500
map in Belgium so we have an excellent

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,290
base map so that means we can use the

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,530
map for as a reference map so we can

00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,600
know where stuff is we have an excellent

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,090
transport related data we I think we

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,980
have a good quality road network we have

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,769
decent transit data which means we have

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,729
all of the bus stops and train stations

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,530
and stuff like that

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,890
we have reasonable and use and we have

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:14,400
very basic address coverage but yeah how

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:20,940
are we sure how do we know how far along

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:23,550
are we these are just things I claim to

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:27,420
know but nobody real can really confirm

00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:30,690
this so and what if things change so how

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:36,630
good are we if things change I have I

00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:39,390
have no idea so that's why we did this

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,350
so road completion so in Belgium there

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,360
we have open data this is only the half

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,650
of Belgium we have open data in Flanders

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,130
we have this whole here is brussels we

00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,810
have open data there as well but the

00:01:52,130 --> 00:02:00,240
other side of belgium they still need to

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:01,979
open up their data but anyway so road

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,020
completion is about mapping all the

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,200
roads but it's not about importing data

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,269
into a street map it's also not about

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,989
changing the way we map so it's very

00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:13,519
important

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,519
it's it's it's

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,739
it's about this

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:22,200
so completeness Quality Assurance and

00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:26,650
change detection so we try to we try to

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,080
we try to make sure that OPA street map

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,020
is complete that oversweet map is is a

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,910
high quality for well when it comes to

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,950
roads so so what do we do and how do we

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:43,480
do this we compare over sweeten up with

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:46,030
other data then we do mapping and then

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,250
we give feedback so the feedback part it

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,480
may be a little bit strange more on that

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:56,730
later so how does it work

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:59,110
so we compare a suite map with open data

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,569
then the community that's mapping and

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:06,310
then things can go to waste

00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:08,890
so either the errors or the changes we

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,080
detect are false

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,630
so there that means that the open

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,239
datasets are wrong which it happens a

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:19,600
lot so it goes into a false positive

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,239
database if the open data is right we

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,100
correct it in OpenStreetMap these two

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,329
loops the idea is that these two loops

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:34,420
continuously updating and to to make

00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:36,220
them continuous so how do we do this we

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,170
convert the source data usually it's

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,930
shapefiles it's a government institution

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,150
so they they use shapefiles and they use

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,489
this weird projection specific to

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:50,109
Belgium and blah blah blah blah blah so

00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:53,769
we convert it we we slice it up into

00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:56,530
vector tiles and then we use this thing

00:03:53,769 --> 00:04:05,049
called tau power reduce to compare all

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:08,980
of the tiles well relatively fast so at

00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:12,670
the moment we have version 0.1 which is

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:15,880
our first so we started like let's start

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:18,729
simple let's just draw buffers around

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,159
top street map and then see whatever is

00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:22,990
not below those buffers if stuff we need

00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:26,620
to check out so we

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,509
we have this the result in the end is

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,360
everything that's not below one of the

00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:36,669
buffer so I like gifts so this is a gif

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:39,220
of what's happening so we can be draw

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:41,080
buffers around oversweet map we put it

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,630
on top of the open data and whatever is

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,620
not below those buffers it's stuff we

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:50,380
need to verify and check so this is one

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,979
of the results so we have yeah you we

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:59,080
have these little segments that we need

00:04:53,979 --> 00:05:00,880
to verify but this is yeah so in this in

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,979
these data set there are a lot of

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,280
driveways more on that later so this is

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:11,380
an example of what we get so in Belgium

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:13,870
we have a lot of these new yeah how do I

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,410
say this in English so we have we have

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,830
new roads so probably this injury is out

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:24,310
of date but the road is actually there

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:26,740
or the road is not yet there but yeah so

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,849
this is this these are the details we

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,590
want to fix same here this is I think

00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:35,130
probably mappers thought this was a

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:41,280
driveway but it's actually a public road

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:44,470
so stuff like that happens as well so

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,900
about over sweet nap and more details

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,630
but why we are doing this you can see

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:57,550
this is a visualization of the evolution

00:05:49,630 --> 00:06:01,449
of the road network from I think to 2008

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,330
until the present day and you can see

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:09,280
that in the end we're almost everywhere

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:11,110
up until 98% of the same road lengths so

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,370
we compare road links in all of these

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:18,220
little areas and then this is a very

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:21,639
interesting graph or statistic thank you

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,460
yours for doing this you can see that a

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,940
new series in almost every area in

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:33,130
belgium and i think we can even expand

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:35,409
this globally but also sure so you can

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,459
see that people start mapping road

00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:41,919
research research and then here in 2013

00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:46,689
he said well it's complete but we have

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:49,689
this 2% still missing and the 2% is what

00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:52,629
we are trying to fix because there there

00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:54,639
there there are still roads missing but

00:06:52,629 --> 00:07:00,369
I'm not sure why mappers are not

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:03,279
catching those that know that 2% so what

00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:08,050
what did we do the first run we did we

00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:10,479
found 13,000 or almost 14,000 cases but

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,389
they were mostly driveways because the

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:17,050
open data set can does not only contain

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:19,360
roads but also driveways which was

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:23,860
really annoying we had no way of

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,839
filtering out that data we put the task

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:33,939
of map roulette but we found out that

00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:37,749
only a 1042 cases were fixed and yeah

00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:41,169
it's difficult to do to show people what

00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:43,689
they need to do so because of that we

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,919
built something else on top of map

00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:49,769
roulette but we built something

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:52,149
something new we built a very small app

00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,979
developed during open summer code with

00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:57,249
these awesome students so you see them

00:07:53,979 --> 00:08:01,360
they're awesome and we built this road

00:07:57,249 --> 00:08:03,550
completion tool funded by the brussels

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,439
government because they want to want to

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,269
map all the roads you know per street

00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,659
map because they use apps on top of

00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:12,459
cores em so they asked us to map to make

00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:19,689
sure that the road network is complete

00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:23,469
for brussels so let's see let's look at

00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:29,319
some of the results so this is a tool we

00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:31,149
get and you see here this is one of the

00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,009
differences we detect but this is just

00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:35,469
because Open Street Map Maps things

00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:40,349
differently from the open data set so we

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:41,849
we have a roundabout here at the end and

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:45,189
yeah

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:48,399
so but it's correct but it's still it's

00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:48,970
still something it takes as a difference

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,300
so

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,569
we also have a lot of false positives so

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,180
stuff that makes no sense at all

00:08:54,569 --> 00:09:00,759
we're pretty sure there's nothing here

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,089
so the open data set is probably

00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,089
incorrect

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,790
also interesting this is not mapped on a

00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,340
street map that it should be it's a

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,780
small road with a parking area and this

00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,570
is in Brussels is one of the most

00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:30,060
populated places in Belgium but we're

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,770
still missing stuff so this is these are

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,950
the two percent we were talking about

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:40,670
about verifying completing the map

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,670
so yeah this these details are important

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,140
so and then I found one example after

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,360
long after a long search that we

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:52,980
actually miss one of these the actual

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,510
streets so this is not mapped in

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,120
OpenStreetMap you see there is a car

00:09:54,510 --> 00:10:02,130
here so this is definitely a street that

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,440
should be mapped in osm but it's not so

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,920
we do it so we do the tech stuff that's

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,920
missing

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:16,920
so what another feature we added is 2 so

00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,130
we have mappers mapping in this tool but

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,200
they're not going outside they're not

00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:24,330
mapping as usual so they they should

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,970
check it in the field but this is

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:31,470
something feature we added that we can

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:33,990
add notes to the map or we can yeah we

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,530
can go to observe up in this case genius

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,540
so this is a road here there is

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,730
construction going up so I thought this

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,000
person removed the road from Street not

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:47,700
because it's not accessible anymore then

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,680
we started discussing this and it it

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,020
turns out that this person lives there

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,990
and II check this you checked out this

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,480
change so it's where we're doing better

00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,370
in this case we're doing better in this

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,290
case than the open data set because if

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:05,840
this is in the open data set but it's

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:08,760
but it's not there anymore in real life

00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:12,260
so what are our goals it's to verify

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,450
there was m network and we also want to

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,400
generate quality metrics we want to do

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,910
this in the open so anybody can verify

00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,070
and check this and rerun their own stuff

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:27,180
so we can prove how awesome Oak Street

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:29,360
map is and how complete it is so why are

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:34,950
we doing this

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:40,140
so I've worked with OpenStreetMap

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:42,540
professionally and I do routing and for

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:46,770
example I tried to talk to some

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:50,100
companies let's well TomTom in here and

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:53,550
I try to buy GPS data from them and they

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,640
say well but we don't want to link our

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,340
data to an inferior network for example

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,770
that's what they take they also say we

00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,630
don't want to their was M data does the

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,610
Horsham license doesn't allow combining

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:10,260
it with our data that's just not true

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:13,440
it's not true sorry I was yeah so they

00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:16,770
they try to sell me stories that weren't

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,530
true also something you hear a lot for

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,890
from in on the business side of a street

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,260
map

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:25,650
anybody can modify OS m so you must be

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,450
crazy not to use it to use it and

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:31,230
they're all there's a lot of this stuff

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:33,120
going on so we need to we need to build

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,520
trust in the map so we need to prove

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,490
that the map is really good but how do

00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,830
we do that and our strategies we compare

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:44,640
it with other data and data that's out

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:47,310
there so that's what we try to do so

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,860
it's all about quality and consistency

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,380
so we try to prove that OpenStreetMap is

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,930
complete that we do have all the roads

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:59,490
that you can use it for your use case

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:03,150
even if your yeah even if you use it in

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:04,920
a logistical application or whatever so

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:09,600
you can open it not this complete so

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:12,510
that's what we want to prove so imagine

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,300
if you would actually do this everywhere

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:18,210
so we have a very cheap or lossless data

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,930
source I say very cheap because doing

00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:24,030
this thus it's some effort and it costs

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,830
some money we the students were funded

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,590
by the process government so it's not

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,420
like completely coxless so imagine we

00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,720
have this data set quality checked and

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,700
verified almost almost up to date it's

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,790
community driven so who can compete with

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:44,630
this I say well almost

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:53,570
buddy so I say we are winning so that's

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:57,760
my talk Thank You Ben nice talks there

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,760
are question from the public yeah I

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:07,850
thank you for your presentation just

00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,760
have a question about this 2% missing

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:13,400
Rhoads I was just checking on the

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,340
website you you just have a new

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,310
presentation and it looks like all the

00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,650
redness Rose belongs to the parking area

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,390
it's the first thing so first of all

00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,990
madam jami's rules would be a mistake

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:29,750
obviously but on the other hand it sells

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,850
a lot of parking areas and not tagged as

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:35,060
a red one and I believe in lots of

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:37,520
cities in Brussels in Belgium as a

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,070
Brussels there are a lot of parking area

00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,050
created next to the building so it

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,360
creates actually change so it should be

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,780
consistent other all these partners

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,600
should be part should be tagged as a as

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:52,910
an area actually notice the road but

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,180
then you're kind of creating an issue

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:59,540
with that your dataset purification is

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:02,720
written all these positives result how

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,060
would you comment about them can can you

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,650
give the microphone here because my

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:13,370
partner in crime Yost is going to ask me

00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:15,380
the the 2% figure is from flowers in

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,290
Brussels it's actually only half a

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,510
percent so when you have numbers that

00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,420
small the amount of false positives will

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,910
be very high among the cases you have

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:29,180
but since it's a very small number you

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:32,600
can just manually review them so I think

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:35,810
it's quite easy to to handle now at the

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,390
2% and flounders they're the the ratio

00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:46,120
of real cases you have to fix this a lot

00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:46,120
higher yeah and they're mostly driveways

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,290
any other questions yeah been fantastic

00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,449
stuff

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,730
thanks for presenting two quick

00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:04,209
questions one is do you feedback these

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,880
false positives to the to the government

00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:09,820
to the official data do they do anything

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,420
with it and the other the other question

00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,649
is so you've tried to use map roulette

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,230
which I'm happy about

00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,420
um do you have any suggestions for

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,880
making a map roulette more usable for

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,339
stuff like this yes because the main

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,810
reason we use map roulette is because we

00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,480
want to build the false positive

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:31,209
database so we cannot just build a map

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,519
where we where we have everything on the

00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:35,769
map and people just fix it because we

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,449
also want to feedback false positives

00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:41,560
and we want to correct the government

00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:43,899
data at the moment we do feed this back

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,699
but there are so slow we don't really

00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,440
know if they're actually using it but

00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:50,110
we're we're trying to do it is because

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,910
we believe in this in the cooperation

00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,510
between what they are doing and what

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:58,959
OpenStreetMap is doing so why not work

00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:03,220
together and try to form a team so it's

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:06,870
our ambition but this part is not really

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:09,730
happening yet so it's it's usually well

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:13,600
false positives feedback the reason we

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:16,419
don't use map roulette is because people

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,100
like to focus on their area as the main

00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:25,030
reason and so we built this tool now to

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:32,010
to have to so they see a map I don't

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:32,010
know let me show again the actual to

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,200
so they see a map and it's red and the

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,210
ambition is to clear all the red and it

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,239
thought it really speaks to people like

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:52,809
if if in their area there's red they

00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:52,809
want to fix it so that's yeah

00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:06,070
and I wanna thank you for your

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,080
presentation is that - and the the tool

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,900
set that you use to generate this data

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,290
is that open source yes yes yes

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:22,200
so we this open somewhere of codes thing

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:24,240
we did so it's all on our github

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,590
whatever I don't know

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,180
organization from OpenStreetMap Belgium

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,030
so we can find everything there the

00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:34,620
front-end to do this the backend to

00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:37,360
compare the data we use Tippecanoe and

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:40,210
Tyree do so there are open source tools

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,880
as well so yes you can find everything

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,630
online and do this yourself - yeah

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,630
obviously

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,900
which one of those who have the code

00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,560
that's that will go to my question dead

00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,480
can you say again well I wish where's

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,520
the code that is it undergo completion

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:15,600
can you grab the code there or do you

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:17,040
those are the actual code is I didn't

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,730
mean to put you mean to put you on the

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,710
spot here

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:29,100
no no it's fine you have told me to do

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:31,020
it so we have this this is a so we

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,820
derived everything so this is all these

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,950
are all this is all the code and scripts

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:38,940
comparing everything from Sarty from

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:43,170
open data to read map it's this does

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:48,080
everything and we also have a repository

00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:51,620
for the front-end part which is this one

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,620
so yeah

00:19:53,750 --> 00:20:01,110
anything else there are any other

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:03,420
question well that's just one things as

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:06,420
we did a kind of work like this just for

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,490
it's very mint which is the scale of

00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,190
these accuracy so you consider just one

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:13,380
buffer and how did you pick this buffer

00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,750
for the completion on you do I don't

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,400
know an increase in buffer to set up

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,850
both of them position I like to tackle

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,630
also the position accuracy yeah so this

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:27,120
is just version 0.1 you know we're just

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:30,300
getting started and we can do so many

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,400
things we can compare a lot of react if

00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,940
we compare a lot of we can do a lot of

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,130
more stuff you can compare street names

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,440
classifications all of that but we

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,360
decided to start with simple stuff let's

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,230
just see if stuff is there or not

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,660
and once we we go over the map and we

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,700
can verify and check this part then we

00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:54,810
can move on to the more complicated

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:56,640
stuff but yeah the most important thing

00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:59,520
is to do quality checks and

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,230
consistencies checks and our ambition is

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,310
also to put this on the OpenStreetMap

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:06,910
belgian website that that

00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:09,490
a metric that it just says like okay we

00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:12,490
have ninety nine point eighty five

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:15,730
percent of roads compared to these open

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:18,640
datasets for example but also the other

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:21,730
way around we can do we can say like

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,860
okay the open datasets have 89 percent

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,290
of the roads you know because if you do

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,570
the comparison the other way around you

00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:31,570
see that they also missile miss a lot of

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:34,380
stuff so we need to put this online

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:42,520
to prove how good oversweet map is

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:47,589
that's the allocation okay thank you

00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,589
