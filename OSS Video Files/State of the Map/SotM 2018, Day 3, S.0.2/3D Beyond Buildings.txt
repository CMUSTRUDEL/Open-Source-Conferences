When it comes to 3d maps, buildings are usually a major focus. This makes it easy to miss the potential that other features have to offer as we create a 3d model of our world.

Even today, OpenStreetMap contains a lot of data that is immediately useful for 3d rendering. For roads, this includes a range of attributes related to lanes, sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, surface and traffic signs. But there's also sports venues, street furniture, railway infrastructure, power lines and a wealth of other details to consider. All of them can make a 3d world more accurate and colorful.

To explore the possibilities of 3d rendering, this session will use examples from the open-source renderer OSM2World. At the same time, we'll discuss the underlying tagging standards – ranging from the reliably established to the excitingly experimental – and consider the future development of 3d data in OSM.

thank you for the opportunity to present

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:11,580
with chalk my talk is about 3d rendering

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,250
with OpenStreetMap data and the focus is

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,720
on basically everything in autumn that's

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,180
not a building why am i presenting to

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,090
talk I'm presented to talk because I am

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,830
the maintainer of 3d rendering software

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,830
called osm to merge

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,410
[Music]

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,309
sweetie render a code om to bird which

00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:55,150
is of course open to our software and is

00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:58,610
designed to create 3d models from

00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:00,860
OpenStreetMap data these models can then

00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,470
be used for various purposes it can be

00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,680
used at a library and other programs it

00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:10,820
can export the model to a modelling

00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,090
format for example wavefront of G and it

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:19,430
can render the model directly using open

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:23,000
chair so for example my doctor came to

00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:26,600
Jewess 3d theme to end up with opengl

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,940
such as this example it can be used and

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,950
have been used for game development for

00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,680
example some users have tried creating

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,560
super tube card wave tracks from open

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,320
street map data using my tool you just

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:45,710
have been experimenting with virtual

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:51,770
reality or creating art and video using

00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:53,479
Odom's verge if you want to preview the

00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,200
abilities of all them to birds without

00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:59,119
installing it there online map that's

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,670
using live lab so it doesn't show the

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,890
full capabilities of the software but it

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,950
allowed a quick glance at the

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,739
functionality unfortunately we recently

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:14,360
migrated to a new server hardware though

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:19,130
it's not fully operational again sorry

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:22,820
for that ok that's about the software I

00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,530
wanted to mention it because well a some

00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,620
people may not have heard of it yet and

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:32,329
B it's a context for what I'm going to

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:34,720
talk about there tagging standard called

00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:38,200
simple 3d buildings in OpenStreetMap

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,810
which is is essentially the current

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:46,370
standard for how we model buildings in

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:50,239
3d not everyone may be familiar with 3d

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,060
rendering and 3d tagging so the general

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,569
idea

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,330
simply 3d building if you just draw the

00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:59,610
building at normally or to another peak

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,709
you can also draw a smaller part of the

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:06,870
building so like I think the tower

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:09,420
I think component a finger smaller area

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,330
in that larger building and you can just

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,940
attack to them so you can tell the

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,580
software how high the building if how

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,620
many levels have which colored the

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,880
building and the truth have which

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:27,180
material it has what shaped roof have in

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,680
which direction to move phases so it's

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:35,430
really simple and well it works with

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,880
normal OpenStreetMap juist so this is

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:42,630
not new this gives you 3d building like

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:47,959
this one and it has been around since

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:53,100
well 2012 when it was defined at second

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:55,549
3d workshop in guiding this is now

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,269
supported by lot and really lot of

00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:02,130
applications that consumes of data and

00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:05,519
despite of limitations it's well

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:08,700
established that really well and

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,560
understanding what the text mean lots of

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,390
methods use them they are three that

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,640
their tools their chosen plugin

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:20,579
everything you want to work with it but

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,410
because simple 3d building is

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,720
essentially the thing you're most

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,020
established means of adding 2d

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,229
information to OSM it's often overlooked

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,940
that a 3d world needs more than just

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:37,860
buildings and I want to focus a bit on

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,890
what else we already have in

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,700
OpenStreetMap data that can be used to

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:49,560
enrich 3d verge as rendered by an

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:51,720
application so well OpenStreetMap a

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,110
streets in the name so it's obvious that

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,380
we have a lot of raw data we have a lot

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,460
of railway data and these can be used

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:05,090
already today for 3d rendering

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:08,870
so to start with you get a lady number

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:12,020
you get a whispers and for each lane or

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:15,680
even for the road as a whole you can

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,470
render basic road shape but it doesn't

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:23,270
stop there you can go on for example to

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:25,730
tack sidewalks you can go on to add the

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,340
other information you can even do this

00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,290
on a per Lane base or added for

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:34,580
individual sidewalk individuals like

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:37,550
away and you can get relatively close to

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:44,290
describing the geometry of a road with

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:48,920
simple tag on a finger way additional

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:52,820
tagging systems exist for example for

00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:55,250
lane tagging for tagging overtaking

00:05:52,820 --> 00:06:00,110
rules that can be used in 3d rendering

00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:02,990
contact to infer infer the actual road

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,680
markings so depending on the country's

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:10,670
traffic law overtaking route might be

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:14,360
represented by dashed or solid road line

00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:17,060
so worth of information which was not

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,420
collected for the purpose of 3d

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:24,980
rendering can nevertheless be used to

00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,900
make 3d map more realistic and closer to

00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,440
reality

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:33,950
other examples include for example

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:39,910
pedestrian crossings like this or turn

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:42,910
lanes using the widely huge turn : lanes

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,910
key

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,490
this is not as common but method has

00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:54,139
already started years ago to map traffic

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:58,159
time that of course that other something

00:06:54,139 --> 00:07:01,099
that's nice to have for 3d rendering

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:04,069
purposes again these were not originally

00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:08,440
mapped for 3d rendering but they

00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:08,440
nevertheless very useful for the purpose

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,289
so now we are leaving the realm of

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:21,860
established tagging and getting into

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:23,479
more experimental territory this is an

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,949
idea that has been floating around for

00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:30,740
quite a few years the idea that I think

00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:32,810
array cannot in all cases accurately

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,930
describe the shape of a roach

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:39,349
so methods have in some part of the

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:42,530
world started to add an area in addition

00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:46,729
to the centerline way that describes the

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:49,909
extent of the road surface and the

00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:53,870
probably most public key for deep kind

00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:56,120
of area the area highways so because

00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,490
we've had gotten some traction in the

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,719
o'them community I of course that it

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:05,270
looking at how this could be used for 3d

00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:07,789
rendering now one of the challenges here

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,099
if I want to keep the ability to do the

00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:11,930
things I showed before so I want to

00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:16,009
continue being able to offer example

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:20,800
lander render lane when sidewalks and so

00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:25,190
on and to do that I need to somehow

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,449
divide the road into several strips

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:31,039
eventually separate several lanes and

00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,289
that's not as easy as it sounds because

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:38,079
these road chip can until you get

00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:40,490
arbitrarily complex this has not been

00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:43,010
finished and autumn to bird yet but I

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:46,670
want to nevertheless pretend what I've

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:50,329
implemented so far a bit of an well

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:52,190
perhaps adding a few idea to the

00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,079
discussion and maybe getting some

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,380
feedback how other people have solved

00:08:54,079 --> 00:09:01,130
the problem of rotating highway areas so

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:03,199
my first attempt was eventually what

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,690
makes a thing the way too comfortable is

00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:09,260
that I can just create a line that

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:13,240
orthogonal to the way and if I do that

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:17,839
at each node of the way then I get well

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,449
simple model of the way though I say

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,449
this is 5 meter to the right of the

00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:25,490
center line and can simply follow one of

00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:29,029
these green line to the right side and

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:31,029
for example draw a curve layer that

00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:34,970
separates the sidewalk from the roach

00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:37,610
this is a simple approach and it works

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:41,930
okay it like this but it does not work

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:44,600
especially in curved sections of highway

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,720
area where you will get overlapping

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,829
angle by vectors so in those situations

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,709
I did that I needed a separate mechanism

00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:56,930
and that separate mechanism is run

00:09:54,709 --> 00:10:04,579
lengths along both the centerline way

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:08,329
and outline way so I do what I did

00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:11,089
before removes those lines that were

00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:16,000
marked in red which are intersecting and

00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:19,339
I instead interpolate along the

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,260
centerline and outlined ways for these

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:27,740
sections between each pair of successive

00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,750
green lines and just work so far so it's

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,510
relatively promising and I'm currently

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:35,540
working on building a 3d rendering

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:40,760
implementation for a highway area based

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:43,579
on that general idea I mentioned well

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,440
wait wait I don't want to talk as much

00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:49,839
about them as I did about the roads

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,490
because well mainly because not very

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,470
experienced the topic of wave wait I

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,500
mean there are railway enthusiast

00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:01,250
matters who would take a lot of thing

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:04,400
but I don't really understand that so if

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,180
I want to well when that is

00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,710
realistically

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:10,990
then I need the railway community to

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,870
but help me with that and that one of

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,450
the ways I'm asking for help if you are

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,870
interested in a particular topic in

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:23,140
mapping and would like to see this topic

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:26,160
represented in 3d rendering if you're

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,900
essentially an expert for the topic then

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,440
please contact me and helped me

00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:36,070
understand T is complicated tack for now

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,310
my railways will look like this and they

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:45,660
support a few tags like wavy gouache but

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:48,280
not much beyond okay so one of the

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,800
central idea that I wanted to prevent

00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,860
that om already has a lot of data that

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,590
suit with the for 3d rendering even if

00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,200
that data was originally mapped for a

00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:02,080
different purpose and another category

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,690
with that case is street furniture

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,780
so for example you have advertising

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,450
billboard node and lots of tags on them

00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:13,450
so you have a tag with tag

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:16,930
- that'd though except opposed on both

00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,180
side or only on one side and people

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,170
actually map quite a lot of the table

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,170
tag bill

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,370
promising approach I found with 3d

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:31,750
rendering is creating professional

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:35,230
models so if I just create a single

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,420
model for example in 3d modeler and

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:41,020
place it at each location where an

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:44,200
advertising billboard node display that

00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:47,800
may look good but it may not make it as

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,290
easy to well interpret all the

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,500
additional subtext at map as I've also

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:57,220
added through those nodes so I'm trying

00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:00,700
to make those less mad enough to

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:03,760
understand T subjects are they examples

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,130
of like how the bicycle parking there

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,740
are lots of different variants are more

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,330
comfortable to a cyclist and others - of

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,070
course be different would have been

00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:18,340
mapped and these differences can be

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:21,939
rendered and well roads wave weight and

00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:24,970
street furniture not everything

00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:28,269
to know them that a lot more the for

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:31,209
example 2d maps have already started a

00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:33,999
few years ago to render pitch line

00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:38,079
there's something that I feel also

00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:40,389
enriches a 3d rendering so if you have

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,449
some leisure pitch areas and you can

00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:46,179
mark them with four tags and potentially

00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:49,569
add a subject and get it rendered in 3d

00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:53,769
in a more realistic manner than if we I

00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:58,119
charge displayed a colored area you get

00:13:53,769 --> 00:14:02,319
think like waterslides or barriers like

00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:06,119
jersey barriers guardrail and what I've

00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:11,229
also noticed is that a lot of these

00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:13,629
different way based tag can be rendered

00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:16,599
with a single algorithmic approach which

00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:19,329
is essentially extrusion with something

00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:20,919
that 3d modelers have been using for a

00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:24,489
long time so you have essentially a

00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:31,829
two-dimensional shape and extruded along

00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:37,569
a part you eventually well draw it out

00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:40,479
into a three-dimensional shape and for

00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:45,489
example the first shape an extruded gets

00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:47,589
your part of the guardrail let's extrude

00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:49,989
it with a few gaps in between get deter

00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:57,279
the various and another shape to that

00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:59,199
give you water slide attractions okay at

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,929
this point I'm just going to add a few

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,209
more things that can be 3d rendered just

00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:06,909
to give you a bit of a taste or well

00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:09,459
what's possible and many other things

00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:12,459
that are not shown could of course be

00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:15,609
possible to are all four already

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:19,959
so for example railings chain-link

00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:23,249
fences gabion walls other boys again

00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:27,819
there's a lot of subtext people add I

00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:30,100
always amazed Chow but people are

00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:33,009
interested in things like how high

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,589
befall exactly is a brick wall or if

00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:35,889
it's a concrete wall and but of course

00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,259
it

00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:41,589
people grow the lengths to add to the

00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:44,230
information I want to also show them on

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:48,309
the map which is why I try to the part

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:51,939
of many of these tags of possible power

00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:55,569
lines another topic have been an autumn

00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:58,540
to work for quite a time and even things

00:15:55,569 --> 00:16:04,509
like man a flagpole can look better in

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:07,299
3d if you add a few top tracks so this

00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:12,149
was a tip of the iceberg there's a lot

00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:14,769
more but still decide om having that

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:17,350
amount of data

00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:21,399
despite of them being such a rich data

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:24,699
thought for 3d rendering they are think

00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:28,540
that we probably will never put directly

00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:31,299
into all of them for example we have 3d

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,899
buildings but can we really model like

00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:38,769
the Eiffel Tower in autumn or I mean we

00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:43,299
can place a parabola node to represent

00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:46,480
Apollo but that come in lot of sizes in

00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:49,959
a lot of shape and this distinction may

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,639
actually be a bit beyond all of them

00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:56,709
this is why there have been recently a

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,860
launch of the so-called 3d model

00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:03,579
repository which is essentially a

00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:08,139
website where you can upload 3d models

00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:11,409
and link them to OSM so you create a 3d

00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:14,649
model with one of the tools that well a

00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:18,010
specialized for that kind of task for

00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:20,649
example using blender we heard a talk

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:24,419
about that yesterday or using like

00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:28,260
non-free software like ketchup and you

00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:30,940
upload this model to that website

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:37,450
linkage with over them using one of

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:39,850
these slightly cryptic IDs and well you

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:43,000
get a 3d model in renderer that support

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,669
the 3d model repository this can be like

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,129
a model of a particular park bench that

00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:49,360
has a pinkish shade or it can be a

00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:50,950
historic building

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,890
it can be essentially anything that can

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:58,679
be mapped in om just with more

00:17:53,890 --> 00:18:02,110
three-dimensional detail small

00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,450
limitation or employed have not yet

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,920
finished adding the feature but there

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,500
are obviously to you and ever through

00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:13,210
already supported and I'm also working

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:16,679
on building full support for the 3d

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:20,590
model repository into or them to watch

00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:22,950
okay so at our Tech Talk like this

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:25,960
wouldn't be complete without well

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:30,940
telling you how you can have make my

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:34,480
doctor better and of course what always

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,799
very calm is help with coding so there

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,990
are a lot of things that are already

00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,210
being rendered a lot of things that are

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,970
not yet being rendered justified being

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,220
in the treatment database and the reason

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,410
is simply where they take some time to

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,830
program test and if someone want to help

00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,610
me

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:54,549
I had always a con I'm either looking

00:18:51,610 --> 00:19:00,070
into web front-end development because

00:18:54,549 --> 00:19:03,760
the map I linked before is still using

00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:08,320
leaflet which it's not ideal for well

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:12,190
rapture read for any 3d map really and

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,679
WebGL would empower a more interactive

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,360
presentation without having to use a

00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,419
download to program haunt of their own

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,669
computer there are other topics listed

00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:25,660
here rabbit are we interested in people

00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:27,640
who know about them and who want to be

00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:31,030
involved with helping or them to work

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,669
get better then other a lot of

00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:35,799
non-coding work so so for example I

00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:38,980
mentioned before people who know a lot

00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:42,850
about a particular topic like rave AIDS

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,940
or even advertising divideth or traffic

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,940
signs in a particular country

00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:52,390
these things topic I don't know a lot

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,370
about and if someone tells me how to be

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:58,450
a word looks it makes it easier for me

00:19:54,370 --> 00:20:00,190
to implement it in orange I'm also

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,920
always looking for better textures

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:07,300
better 3d model because that

00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,690
Mourad curves and I have rental

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:12,280
improvements like for example adding

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:15,160
localized version of particular things

00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,620
like the lines of the road look

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,660
different in every country and people

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,990
from that country will be better than I

00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:27,190
am at telling autumns world how to make

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:28,930
it look just right and for example also

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:33,310
making it easier for people to import

00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:35,500
software all these ways to help or them

00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:38,140
to work get better but of course

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,610
probably the most important way of

00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:44,290
helping autumns world and even more data

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,780
continue mapping and add more of that

00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:49,420
fantastic level of detail that makes it

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:53,370
possible to even think about rendering

00:20:49,420 --> 00:21:01,330
3d words using only OpenStreetMap data

00:20:53,370 --> 00:21:05,580
thanks a lot thank you very much studios

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,580
if someone has some question for him

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:19,870
what's the current number of 3d models

00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:23,650
uploaded to 3d model repository what is

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:27,280
the current number of 3d models upload

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:30,700
it to 3d repository you mentioned in the

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:36,310
talk I didn't get the beginning of the

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:41,530
question you can yes how many other new

00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:46,060
D models we currently have like a few

00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:48,340
dozen we are probably tuned going to get

00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:52,720
an input from a predator of the 3d model

00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:54,940
repositories open building model project

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,240
which will booth out number technicality

00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,400
so we are still at the beginning but I

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,010
believe that the promoting that and

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,450
would love for more people to contribute

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,450
model to the repository

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:21,109
okay so thank you very much yes

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,109
