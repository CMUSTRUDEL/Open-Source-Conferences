Description: 
	Yuri Astrakhan (Elastic), State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/T118-Making_bot_edits_safe_and_acceptable

This talk is an attempt to find a compromise between editors who want to use bots, and those who oppose it in a safe, friendly atmosphere. We will look at the problems bots can solve, as well as the problems bots can cause.

	00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:08,580
testing yeah hi everyone I hope the

00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,559
conference is treating you well no

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,750
conflicts a lot of stuff done right I

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:19,890
hope I'm gonna be talking about a very

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,680
controversial topic I know some of you

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,680
love the automation BOTS especially the

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:31,920
chaos they create we're all about chaos

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:37,079
right so very briefly about myself my

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,719
name is Yuri I a I contributed a lot to

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,149
Wikipedia I contributed some to

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:47,070
OpenStreetMaps I'm actually the author

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,960
of Wikipedia API back in 2005 still

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,430
regret it I mean still regret the

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,890
decisions I made some of them but a lot

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,360
of people I hope at least I got a lot of

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,989
complaints about it so that means people

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,570
are using it so let's talk about bots

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,909
for OSM and some of the stuff that I

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,140
learned about bots in Wikipedia I mean

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,760
there is an idea that a pipe or

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,720
Wikipedia was because I was doing BOTS

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,780
for Wikipedia and page scraping is kind

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,590
of difficult I mean when you try to edit

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,640
Wikipedia and you use HTML page scraping

00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,890
obviously you don't get very good

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,799
results at least very stable results it

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:29,520
works only now tomorrow it breaks so

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,650
let's get into this the most important

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,009
thing that any open-source project can

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,200
get is contributors time this is the

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,460
most valuable because especially

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,590
initially you don't have an OP of it you

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,860
want everyone to come and join you and

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:50,909
help you but then I feel like I'm

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,780
getting feedback but then you end up

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,729
with community spending a lot of time

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,430
not contributing but basically arguing

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:03,270
with itself and arguing about all sorts

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,579
of fun stuff and less fun stuff and the

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,469
project kind of stalls a little bit and

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,160
then some contributors get upset and

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,120
they leave so the the background of this

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,200
talk I will

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,610
- I would like to frame it as let's

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,500
value the most the biggest thing we have

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,780
which is the contributors you you

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,099
basically everyone here and there your

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:29,310
time my goal has to be friendly

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:32,580
I know sometimes discussions get out of

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,810
hand the special and talk email list but

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,640
I hope we can be as friendly respectful

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,370
productive and understand that we're all

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,489
trying to do something that's good for

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,640
everyone good for the community they're

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:49,920
all running through some problems that

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,410
you're trying to solve and bridge the

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,030
gap between those parties that have

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,349
different opinions all right that'll

00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,680
speed up a little bit otherwise you'll

00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:03,930
get bored beta consumers is in a way our

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,420
clients look an argue with that

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:11,489
statement but they're the ones who make

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:15,150
the most use of the data we create so

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:19,440
their goals should be very low barrier

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,680
of entry they need to just jump in and

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,569
use the data and be very happy with it

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,900
which means two things they need to

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,980
understand what the hell we created I

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,630
don't think most of the us don't

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,670
understand what we created so they

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,160
understand even less they look at the

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,819
tags and I'll go into some numbers very

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:43,709
very soon and they're like huh so wait I

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:45,840
have to know the differences between

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,180
different countries no not countries

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,389
counties no actually this street has a

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,829
special rule that you have to assume to

00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:54,389
know because otherwise you won't

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:57,239
understand the tagging that's used for

00:03:54,389 --> 00:04:00,030
that street so there has to be very

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,950
clear contract between me the producer

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,620
of the beta and me the consumer of the

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:07,560
data if you do if those two parties

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,660
cannot talk to each other we're wasting

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,599
time

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,010
see point number one and do as little as

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,870
possible I am lazy

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,919
I am extremely lazy I did not write

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,919
these flights until this morning

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,970
I kind of had some notes beforehand but

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,870
the slides were production of this

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:29,050
morning which means that by

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:33,199
interpolation everyone else is lazy to

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:36,889
write which means that people want to

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,949
spend as little amount of time doing

00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:42,139
things to get the result they want let

00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:45,020
them dedicate their time towards

00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:47,620
creating new value not trying to

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:52,699
understand what value we created

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:54,080
contributor goals flexibility we hate it

00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:58,550
when someone tells us what to do

00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:02,210
I do you have to do it this way well but

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,130
I want to do it that way okay but you

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:08,810
have to do it this manner and you get

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:11,300
into conflicts over that and there at

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,659
the same time while you want flexibility

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:19,220
you also want the new users to be guided

00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:21,650
you want users to be ok I I am NOT very

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,970
sure how to do these things tell me how

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:28,460
I should be doing it guide me into that

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:30,229
and most importantly we want to be

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,990
valued our contributions have to be

00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:36,380
valued otherwise it's like why am I

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,120
wasting my time if what I say now is not

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,990
valued by you I'm wasting my time and

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:45,229
your time so it's whatever we do has to

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:49,550
be valued by those who consume whatever

00:05:45,229 --> 00:06:01,490
we create guess what that top number is

00:05:49,550 --> 00:06:04,460
any guesses no other guesses no this is

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:07,240
the number of unique tags or SM has as

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,240
of this morning

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:16,130
speaking of contracts we have to

00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:17,930
understand as a beta consumer or as a

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,000
beta contributor who is doing working

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,979
side-by-side with you I mean someone

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
living down the street from you needs to

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:26,509
understand what the hell you just

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,529
created if they don't if we do not

00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,900
communicate even between the

00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:30,750
contributors how can they the consumers

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,610
even make sense of

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,100
the stuff especially if there are now

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,440
truck like someone in China trying to

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,140
create a map for someone in French who

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,870
is visiting New York that's a the

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,960
reality of our modern-day world we have

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,110
to have to really work in a way in a

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:53,130
global environment despite having local

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:57,090
knowledge and if that's the number of

00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:59,100
tags and there's a huge long tail for

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:02,310
them I mean the graph looks spectacular

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,070
it just vertical drop and then a very

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:09,000
very very slow trickle trickling of tags

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:10,680
like 1 2 is the most or pretty much 90%

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,770
of them I don't remember the exact

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,740
numbers here so that's a communication

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:20,060
breakdown we don't speak the same

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:23,430
contract language speaking the API terms

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,980
even in same community and the problem

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,720
is we have negative data net value from

00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,180
that because if I am a new person

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,580
contribute contributing or consuming

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,680
data I jump in and I see all these tags

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:40,020
and I start spending my time trying to

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:42,660
understand which tanks I do not need how

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,820
like I don't need most of them okay well

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,590
I have to now do a full-blown research

00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:51,570
trying to understand which ones I don't

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:53,880
need so that's a waste of time or

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,740
someone contributing next next to you on

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,540
the same street also looks at your

00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,919
contributions see some weird tags they

00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,870
need to understand do they need to put

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:04,620
it in as well sometimes they do or

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,120
they're like oh cool that's a cool tag I

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,130
should just copy it I'm not sure what it

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:13,770
means though but it looks really really

00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:17,340
neat so as I said I worked a little bit

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,919
with Wikipedia mods I have like three

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,770
million edit but edits for now I'm not

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,390
sure that was back in the days when we

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,729
Ricky Padilla languages were not

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,830
connected to each other in a Cell like

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:31,260
using metadata so basically every wiki

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:35,159
page in every language had a list of

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,560
links to other wiki pages on the same

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,810
topic and whenever the new page was

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,960
added all the existing ones had to be

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:45,089
updated to a link to the new one

00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,070
and that's a wonderful manual task

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,990
people well went ahead and just went

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,899
through all of them and edited them I

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:55,500
mean you can imagine how valuable that

00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:58,500
contribution was so that was about which

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,510
I maintained for a very long time and

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,110
ran and that was just putting those

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,310
things in very like an example of the

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,600
task that you don't want you

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:14,490
contributors to waste their time on BOTS

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,839
caused a lot of problems a lot and I'm

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,270
talking about Wikipedia actually not

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,690
always so I know s/m also had to say but

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,779
boat's hull caused a lot of problems

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:27,300
articles got completely corrupted

00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:29,100
articles got injected and mass I even

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,320
have a graph here somewhere yeah there

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,990
there's a wonderful graph thanks to me

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,300
who pointed it to me this is Wikipedia

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:39,180
in the early days

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,930
someone called Ram BOTS I mean anyone

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:46,860
heard of it oh just two people okay so

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:49,080
Ram BOTS not my but I promise you I just

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,120
jumped in these are daily changes this

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,060
how many new articles got created per

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,370
day and created in one day of almost two

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,370
million articles for like all sorts of

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,720
small cities somewhere I mean that's

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,240
kind of useful information right the

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,790
special for Wikipedia articles except as

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,300
you can imagine those articles there was

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:11,459
not enough people to actually work with

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,589
them to maintain them to add something

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:16,589
useful be beyond the very simple

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:22,230
database import reminds you of the what

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:28,680
is that called tiger import right it

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:30,930
interfered with everything BOTS got in

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,300
fights with people I think it should be

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,100
this way no no you're wrong this is how

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,470
it should be you said the human but says

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,130
no no no you don't know anything

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,620
I bought Master has told me to fix it no

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,959
matter what you do and it got back and

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,589
forth back and forth but it also solved

00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:50,790
many problems

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:53,339
grando ism if you blank out a page or do

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,850
some swear words on it it will get

00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,940
reverted without any person

00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,639
and look at it quality control minor

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:04,959
fixes spell checking that are very very

00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:07,600
obvious things like I'm not even sure of

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,970
the extent the scope of all the little

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,170
things that bots in Wikipedia do they

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:17,259
they're they became a transparent hidden

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:21,970
thing that just makes our keeps articles

00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:24,850
clean they solve the Jesus tasks like

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,500
the linking between different pages when

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,870
that was needed and wasn't solved the

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,019
other way an important point they also

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:35,709
welcomed new users whenever a new user

00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:37,959
cap came to Wikipedia and made some

00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,940
change the bot would automatically with

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:43,630
message them says this is so wonderful

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:46,600
you finally came to us you can actually

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:48,670
edit as we've discovered now you can

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,560
actually even look at the rules for

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,589
editing I'm not sure if you're broken

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,060
you're not yet but at least like take a

00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:58,240
look at those and you might find

00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,670
something interesting there by the way I

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,790
believe or Sam has by far better

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,920
messaging system than Wikipedia does

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:08,399
because when something whenever you

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,040
change something the mechanism of

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,990
feedback is much more polished and I'm

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,970
not sure if it's currently being used by

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,829
BOTS but it would be wonderful with for

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,860
example the new user came in edited

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:22,660
something and that change set would get

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,699
a button to brocation saying this is

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,560
wonderful that you made this change here

00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:29,079
are some wonderful links but I mean we

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,870
appreciate you coming in or maybe some

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:33,300
other mechanism to be discussed I don't

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,769
want to go into too many specifics

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,680
because people's like no this is not how

00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:40,300
it's gonna work okay

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,630
Wikipedia lesson number two or page

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:47,740
number two parts must be very easy to

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:51,180
stop especially when it runs amok and

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:54,009
starts creating two million pages a day

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,509
you have to have a very big button and

00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,639
actually there is exists in Wikipedia

00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:00,250
you go to bot user page and there's a

00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,040
gigantic stop button you click it the

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,520
bot stops imagine the level of control

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,830
you have over that thing anyone

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,350
yike I am the master of someone else's

00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:14,520
bar I will just cause chaos that way

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:17,459
okay but it is it to restart too so

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,850
community must be in control boss watts

00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:23,399
might be also very easy to create

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:26,040
if you cannot create a bot you'll

00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:30,230
subverted some other way yo crew started

00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:34,020
using other tools for both like purposes

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:36,690
you start doing areas and trying to hide

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,700
them as bonds people are doing this I

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,680
mean no matter how we say no no this is

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,390
not a problem and I've never been to

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,100
Alcoholics Anonymous but I heard the

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,040
very first thing they say you have to do

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,690
is admit there is a problem clearly

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,810
judging by how many people there are

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:55,080
here there's a problem we're all I mean

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:58,910
we all have been hurt by bots let's put

00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,990
it that way or we all think that

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,830
something has to be done in that regard

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:09,029
so but author someone who wants to solve

00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:11,100
a specific problem should be very she'll

00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:15,930
have a very easy path for them to start

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,970
and start contributing so these are kind

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:21,209
of important things and yeah as I just

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,589
showed you this lovely graph which is we

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:23,700
can enjoy it again but I think this is

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:26,010
the only graph I have a representation

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:30,770
as I said I did this whole thing in the

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:32,820
morning how can we improve

00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,980
communications of concepts that's

00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:38,490
probably the biggest pet peeve of mine

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,579
and I mean I know map box having these

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:44,220
issues Wikipedia had this issues when we

00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:45,750
were creating maps there it's pretty

00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,230
much any data consumer I don't

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,089
understand what you meant by this tag

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:54,209
especially if in addition to that tag I

00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:56,279
also have to analyze in which village

00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,420
that tag is located because the meaning

00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,089
is totally different between two

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:03,750
villages right next to each other for

00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:05,910
example I mean I hope it's not very

00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:11,040
common but that's the thing make reports

00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:12,690
easier whenever people edit the there

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,699
should be very easy way to revert

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,490
Wikipedia actually has this much nicer

00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:18,860
done than you know SM you just go to

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,560
history click undo

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,600
save you're done you just undid this

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,400
whole change that someone else did

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,900
someone's not happy with your birthday

00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:32,450
and do your revert there the what is it

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,310
called the war of reverts it goes back

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,370
and forth quite often but the point is

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,680
it's easy which means people are not as

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,350
scared about BOTS because it's easy to

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,810
undo whatever the held about did pardon

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,450
my french

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:49,610
and we need to increase the number of

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:53,800
useful BOTS something that actually adds

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:56,360
value and reduces the time stop that

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,990
this is how you can contact me in case

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,660
you feel this is important or you have

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:05,360
some ideas or just want to work on this

00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:18,040
and I would like to open for discussion

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:18,040
and thank you question no question

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:29,100
I thanks for the talk as a contributor

00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,270
to both Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap I

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,450
think you're in a good position to

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:36,180
answer this I saw a research paper a

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,320
while back can you hear me I saw a

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,890
research paper a while back that

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:44,310
asserted that the the number of

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:46,260
contributions to Wikipedia started kind

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:49,980
of flattening out around the time that

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:53,850
they introduced automatic revert BOTS or

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,610
vandalism and do you think do you think

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,960
that's accurate do you think it's

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,140
related and do you think it's something

00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,540
we should be concerned about and

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,100
actually I think who sits right next to

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,350
you might have some opinions on this too

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,500
because he has spent some time in this

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,990
um I do believe there is a connection

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,900
there or there might be a connection

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,280
there the question is there's valuable

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,689
contributions and less valuable

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,610
contributions if the number of

00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:22,140
contribution if you look at the total

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:25,829
number of contributions including the

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,839
junk and that junk of decreased kind of

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:31,650
automatically well that's a positive

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,070
thing if like you have to go into deeper

00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,620
analysis and that's kind of hard to do

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:41,130
revert bots was also not perfect

00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:46,050
especially in the beginning they got mmm

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:49,410
Tara called calmed down a bit and they

00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:51,930
started triggering less often also with

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,340
the addition of the new system the the

00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:57,500
one based on machine learning I keep

00:17:53,340 --> 00:18:02,190
forgetting its name what is it

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,550
force yeah so I'm getting old forgetting

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:07,230
things

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:08,910
so with others that's also a big plus so

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,350
that's especially now with all the

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,260
machine learning tools we have to our

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:16,230
disposal something that we should look

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,270
at but there's always going to be right

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,670
now as some does not have a problem of

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,670
how few contributors we get surprisingly

00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:26,340
it's how many we get so maybe it is time

00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:29,970
to maybe a little capital you know not

00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:32,070
kappahd but like subdue just a bit to

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,400
reduce the number of incorrect at it

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,400
maybe

00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:50,530
my opponent official hello I have two

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:55,260
remarks less slash questions number one

00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:58,480
you mentioned greeting new users as

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:03,970
simple and and easy to do to ask for a

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:06,370
bot personally if I if I sign up to

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:09,340
something and I get an automated message

00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,120
back that says welcome we are so happy

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,690
you're here

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:16,270
and I know it's not a human being that

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,550
says I am happy it's a boat there's a

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:23,680
piece of code that says that claims to

00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:25,570
have emotions basically lying to me it's

00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,000
not something that makes me feel good

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,670
it's you know because it's it's it's the

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,940
normal thing nowadays right you you you

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,980
you open a ticket with some say some

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,260
some website you open a ticket you get

00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,360
something back it's so nice that you

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,400
opened this ticket will one of her agent

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,440
will be with you shortly and you know

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,640
okay this is just the standard

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,800
that I get from both so I'm not so sure

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,860
we we do you know we have some

00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,960
communities in OpenStreetMap where

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,810
actual human beings actually take the

00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,400
time to send out messages which are of

00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,440
course boilerplate messages and they

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,810
sent the same message to everyone but at

00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,090
least it's a human being that claims to

00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:11,460
be happy about my contribution I think

00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,460
there's something to be said for that

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,580
this the frustration right this reminds

00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,720
me of their little problem Google just

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,220
had hello I would like to order

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,490
restaurant reservation anyone seen that

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:30,070
video yeah the new thing that Google did

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,930
and I would be scared well not scared

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,560
but please if someone have a robot

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,880
called me and pretended to be human and

00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,110
I'm sure many people have complained

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,970
you've seen that thank you

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,860
probably not basically Google created an

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,340
automatic bot that pretended to be human

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,850
while calling and you cannot tell the

00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,740
difference

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,360
it speaks like a human it behaves like a

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,740
human

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:57,990
it's a freaking Turing test compressor

00:20:52,740 --> 00:21:00,720
bot which is kind of scary in a way that

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,970
is a problem I do not want automated bot

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,210
to say hello how wonderful you're here

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,430
what I do would like to get is hello

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:12,480
here's some useful information that you

00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:15,630
can continue and improving your editing

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,240
skills with if it's a boilerplate thing

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:21,120
does it matter whether it was sent by

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,210
person or not what's important is that

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:28,050
if I reply to that bot message I want a

00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:30,120
human response maybe say look this is a

00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,220
boilerplate message just like you get in

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,020
many chats all right now you call to a

00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,310
contact customer support for I don't

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,460
know some airline and there's an

00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:40,560
automatic header what's your problem and

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,320
you cite the problem and then the human

00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,480
answer is tries to solve the problem so

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,660
maybe that's a solution so to mix the

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,040
two on one hand to provide an automatic

00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:53,670
boilerplate stuff on the other hand have

00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,560
a community of welcoming hope it answers

00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,560
and the security the second one is you

00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,780
said that information that is that

00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,650
doesn't have a meaning is isn't is a net

00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:07,440
negative

00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:10,800
I wonder either if say there's certainly

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,960
a lot of information that doesn't or say

00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,670
if someone has contributed that

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,850
information to OpenStreetMap and they

00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:21,480
meant to communicate some meaning by

00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:25,140
that mostly it's just not obvious what

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,510
the intended meaning was so either there

00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,640
is a way to automatically find out what

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:33,120
the meaning was then you can write a bot

00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:36,210
to fix it but then you could also just

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,060
say improve the lua script in OS m to PG

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:42,330
SQL to just you know create the right

00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:44,760
database from whatever is in OS m or or

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:46,680
it's not obvious what the meaning is in

00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,040
which case you need to basically go back

00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:53,460
to the person and ask them hey well what

00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,620
was it that you wanted to do so that is

00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:59,760
exactly true i exaggerated hundred

00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,509
percent agree with you though whenever

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,539
something is

00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:08,879
eret if you do not understand what it

00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:12,690
means there it needs to be fixed somehow

00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:15,839
right now there is no easy and very

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,179
common mechanism to do that I mean an

00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,579
example of a automatic solution would be

00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:22,619
you've just introduced a new tag or a

00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:25,469
tag that this is almost never used

00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:27,629
could you go here and actually or maybe

00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:30,389
even reply to this message saying what

00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:31,769
you meant by that tag because we think

00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:38,339
it might be a mistake

00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:41,339
a Lua script like a solution is not very

00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:47,399
good because of the time and laziness

00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:48,629
factor I as a beta consumer do not want

00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:51,449
to go through all the hoops of

00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:55,469
understanding any each one of those 70

00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:57,839
almost 80,000 mess tags especially

00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:59,489
because the very other the consumer who

00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,089
is right next to me who is also

00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:05,099
consuming it will have to repeat my work

00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:07,619
we don't want the data consumers to do

00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:09,209
exactly the same work because if all of

00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:15,299
them are doing the same work it should

00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:19,249
be done by one central place so amount

00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:22,829
of something that's not understandable

00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:25,859
is a negative value simply because it

00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:29,249
creates all these questions in the minds

00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:31,079
of other editors and in the minds of

00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:32,969
consumers who trying to use it and

00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:34,319
whenever they spend more time it means

00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:36,479
they're not spending on something much

00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,190
more useful that's the problem it's not

00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:40,649
that the validator in itself is not

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,940
value well it's is that it creates more

00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:44,129
problems than it solves

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,109
so maybe we should address it I'm not

00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:49,199
sure exactly how there are many ways but

00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:50,639
it's it's a problem and alcoholic

00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:54,089
anonymous says that we should admit that

00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:55,799
there is one yes thank you Maggie URI

00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:59,099
oh yeah we're not time for other

00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,130
questions I'll be right out there URI

00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:04,269
later outside
