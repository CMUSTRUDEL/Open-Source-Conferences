https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/T131-Going_to_Production_with_OpenStreeetMap_at_Microsoft

Microsoft has been working intensively with OpenStreetMap data over the past year developing metrics, quality gates, data validation tests and other measurements to determine when and where the data meets stringent internal release criteria. We have found that in some areas, for some services the data is very, very close to being production ready while in other areas there is a long way to go.

In this talk Microsoft will present some of the measurement criteria and how the team uses web scrapes, side by side measurements and routing tests to discover what and where the gaps are in the data and the level of effort required to close them. The team will also describe some of the challenges of bringing a highly unstructured, Open Data set in to the highly structured and process driven environment at Microsoft.

hi good morning we're gonna tag-team

00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,559
this presentation today my name is Jubal

00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,650
Harpster I worked for Microsoft I run

00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,330
the open apps initiative within Bing

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,009
this is my colleague Nicola toe-touch

00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,210
who leads the development team in Serbia

00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:19,880
he's going to be doing the bulk of the

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,080
presentation today and so the the the

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,850
agenda that we want to talk about is

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,710
sort of what we've been doing with Open

00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,869
Street Map and open data in the last

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,369
couple of years at Microsoft including

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:29,300
the buildings data and then we're gonna

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,970
show some of the work we've been doing

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,330
in Australia including a live demo which

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,220
we think is going to work so why are we

00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,049
doing this and so within Microsoft and

00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,400
within being in particular sort of the

00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:43,489
goal here is to service the best

00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,989
possible data to our end users so we

00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:46,940
have a mix of a private area data and

00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:48,860
open data the goal is to service the

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,210
best data available across geographies

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,970
no matter what it is or where it came

00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,640
comes from in many cases OSM is the best

00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:58,489
data for some layers in some places

00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,430
certainly not not everywhere

00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:03,559
we also think that with Microsoft being

00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,239
open about this that we can help

00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,130
facilitate the growth of OpenStreetMap

00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,050
within sort of growing the community and

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,850
where we have maybe 5,000 contributors a

00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,720
day we'd like to see 50,000 contributors

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,570
and we'd like to see more businesses

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,740
jumping into this which is why we think

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,940
it's important for the sort of the

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,350
larger corporations to get on board so

00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,150
Microsoft I mean we have a lot of stuff

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,110
of what we don't have big fleet of cars

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,930
we don't have a lot of telemetry data we

00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,280
don't have a big mobile footprint I know

00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,380
I'm sure a lot of you are not using your

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,909
windows phones and we certainly don't

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,170
have a lot of unlimited funding so it's

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:37,490
unlike some of the other corporate

00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,720
people that we work with that have can

00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,150
throw money at this problem we don't we

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,880
don't have that but what we do have a

00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,440
lot of brilliant engineers we have

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,630
almost unlimited capacity because we

00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,640
have we have cloud Roger We certainly

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,670
have a global reach we have a ton of

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,680
imagery which is a huge asset we have a

00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,820
search engine which is important because

00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,770
we know exactly what people are

00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,710
searching for and we know exactly what's

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,760
important we also have a lot of lawyers

00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,750
and the lawyer thing is really important

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,799
because it you know when I started I

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,150
thought the lawyers are here to sort of

00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,640
hold us back and be blockers but it's

00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,140
actually once we once I got them to

00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,440
understand what we were doing in the

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,700
context of osm and there's nobody you

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,890
know it's and there's nobody to contract

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,910
with and there's nobody to sue and

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,030
we have to have these really

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,069
mind-bending conversations between legal

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,209
and operations and engineering to

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:26,390
actually get this right and we'll be

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,770
talking about some of that today and so

00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,080
the challenge that sort of was put to us

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,910
and this team is because can we serve

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,030
the Microsoft ecosystem and our

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,410
customers with open data and you know

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm sure not a lot of you actually used

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,900
the Bing Maps desktop every day but we

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,100
actually when we put data into the top

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,590
of the pipeline we have to serve this

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,090
entire Microsoft ecosystem and you think

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,200
about all these logos on each one of

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,810
these within Microsoft is like a

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,910
separate company that needs to consume

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,980
this data and it surfaces surfaces some

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,660
other endpoint and so just the internal

00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,070
traffic is several billions of

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,050
transactions per day and so the data

00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,820
that we feed in at some point will pop

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,800
out in Excel or power bi so we have to

00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,550
be very careful about how we assemble

00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,080
the open data with a prior idea now I'm

00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,880
gonna hand this over to my colleague now

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,250
to finish the bulk of the presentation I

00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,920
will be adding colorful commentary thank

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,000
you well okay everyone so I'm Nicola

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,890
Tariq

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,590
I am the engineering manager Microsoft

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,900
working on this project from Serbia we

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,690
are a small team of about 10 developers

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,019
and we like to think ourselves as

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,850
somewhat startup within Microsoft and I

00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,190
think it's super appropriate for us to

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,560
be doing though as Sam so I'm gonna

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,350
start by talking about the buildings

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,910
that we recently shared with the

00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:49,160
community as well as shipped on Bing

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:53,030
Maps so we essentially it was sort of a

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:56,840
two-fold effort our building repository

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:59,360
was quite sparse so the decision has

00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,950
been made to actually take osm buildings

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,630
and display them on the buildings layer

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:09,640
or Microsoft in Bing Maps and the other

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:12,950
initiative was since osm as well had

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,290
some sparse coverage particularly in the

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:19,450
most important market for us which is

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:21,620
the u.s. we went on this journey of

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,979
extracting the buildings from the

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,470
satellite imagery I'm gonna have Nicola

00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:29,510
my colleague talked about this at noon

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:33,110
so we managed

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:37,580
a quick recap we managed to extract 125

00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:46,360
million buildings in the u.s. let me do

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:46,360
a quick demo of this so this is

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,830
yeah so this is Yakima in in Washington

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,190
State these are all computer extracted

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,190
buildings

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,009
all right moving back to the station and

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,199
as some of you may see week we released

00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:36,330
all the data under OD BL and it's

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:38,610
available on github for download some of

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,690
the problems we ran into for using OS m

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:47,460
buildings tagging consistencies so we

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:50,430
will have certain like land use Church

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,460
or something like that and then we just

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:57,210
what a whole big in a building across

00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:01,680
the whole block we have unknown

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:04,409
buildings and overlapped with the

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,800
current base map since we're using data

00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:09,120
from a different source to display roads

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,889
they're gonna overlap sometimes with the

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,720
buildings but we're fine with this the

00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,440
other project actually the the major

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,710
investment for us this year was actually

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:25,139
to take osm data and other open source

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,610
data and essentially assemble a map of

00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:34,050
Australia that we're gonna show on Bing

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:37,020
Maps and yeah it's live so we have an

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:42,780
experiment going with actual live user

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:45,690
traffic seeing the OSM based map of

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,199
Australia where we do essentially all of

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:52,110
the services that Bing Maps supports

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,729
today such as routing geocoding all on

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,729
top of open data

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:06,860
so yeah why Australia so we didn't want

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:10,340
to do something small we wanted to do

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,090
something big yet still not too big in

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,530
terms of user traffic footprint

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,800
Australia was the obvious choice for

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:22,070
multiple reasons

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,690
we could easily carve it out of the

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,630
existing map and put the different

00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,320
Australia in there the Australian

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,080
government

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:34,610
absolutely fantastic work from there and

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,160
the open source a whole bunch of Road

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:45,380
sources address sources that we could

00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:46,370
leverage and warm beaches yeah the one

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,480
thing that I want to emphasize on this

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,000
previous slide is that there's a very

00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,200
active Australian community that's sort

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,390
of a top of the list when we think about

00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,220
which market to tackle because being

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,870
able to sort of work alongside of the

00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,880
community is extremely important to have

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,110
some success and the fact that we talk a

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,430
common language make that made this

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:06,230
really easy for us yeah we heard there

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,000
was a presentation the other day about

00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,370
the editorial team who had tremendous

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,400
help from the community so that

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,590
obviously helped and yeah so this is

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,470
this is an engineering challenge that

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,300
has been bugging me for a while so being

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,390
never had the infrastructure to actually

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:27,200
would call flight data meaning we didn't

00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:29,120
have the capability of pulling with

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,919
actually having two datasets side by

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:37,729
side being served by different services

00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:40,479
based on the parameter and yeah so and

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,310
then we had to secure capacity and it's

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,550
hundreds of machines and while we do

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,790
have a whole bunch of machines

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,660
provisioning them is always hard and

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,240
that somehow worked

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,880
I was actually fascinated how we

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,950
actually pull it off because it's all

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,780
dirty details within the code that

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:05,230
hasn't been touched for years then the

00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,230
demo young

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:16,870
so what we see here is the OSM based

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:19,660
Australia I mean it's big map styled and

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:24,070
jubal and I know the little tricks how

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:30,280
to tell what's our map versus get a map

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:34,870
and then I'm going to talk about what we

00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:37,950
actually got from osm but mainly the the

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:42,460
base map richness of the features is

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:45,250
great and we really think that this is

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:49,420
going to bring out the best that

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:51,600
Microsoft can show to our customers the

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,600
route

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,600
now so this is always some base

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,700
traveling so purely based on OSF all to

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,470
suggest you saw also works so all of

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,740
this works essentially on top of open

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,740
data

00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:43,389
so as I said and we we really looked

00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:47,139
hard in comparing the OSM data compared

00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:52,360
to other data sources out there we find

00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:55,600
that it's very up to date so we have the

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,509
newest road constructions built up that

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,910
nobody else has we have it in osm I mean

00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:04,300
we collectively that's absolutely

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:08,170
fantastic and we have a lot of carto

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:11,230
features now mountains rivers etc what

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:15,759
we don't have admin boundaries

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:19,540
so essentially sub-state sub-state level

00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:22,959
polygons populated places neighborhoods

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:25,899
that's quite sparse addresses we have

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,990
very few addresses address points in OS

00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:32,430
m turn restrictions we had to work

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:37,139
really hard on our editorial team did on

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:40,089
closing the gap on turn restrictions and

00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:42,250
the paved unpaved road attribute which

00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:44,199
is quite important in Australia there's

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,750
a whole bunch of unpaved roads in the

00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:50,589
outback I'm gonna quickly talk about

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:55,240
that in the upcoming slides so you can

00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:56,949
see here osm has essentially roads that

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,980
on the imagery are still being

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:02,850
constructed now I mean they have been

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:09,430
completed but no imagery is showing that

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:12,339
but we can definitely leverage this just

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,800
some quick facts numbers on these things

00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:20,860
I mean they really make the map look

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:24,420
absolutely fantastic so these are the

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:28,720
gaps that we encountered on the image

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,550
the red dots are showing the essentially

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,069
the points from a reverse geocoding test

00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:38,439
set that couldn't be fulfilled using OS

00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:42,689
and data so I mean the pattern is busy

00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:48,480
populated places get labeled by polygons

00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:53,110
the Outback doesn't we have a hundred

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,320
thousand address points in a country

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:59,140
that has on the order of 20-something

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,240
million people so we actually had to use

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,630
a different data source which is

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,660
unfortunately are not compatible with OS

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:18,040
M but we just put it in a different

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:19,839
layer and we pulled out a lien so when

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,080
we started the editorial team when we

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:26,950
started looking at turn restrictions we

00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:30,310
had on the order of ten thousand now we

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:37,570
have about 65,000 and we think we still

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:39,730
are missing about ten thousand the good

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,740
thing about this though is that the

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,020
number of routes that actually do get

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:48,190
impacted by missing ten restrictions is

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:50,380
only at about 0.4% we would ideally like

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:54,250
this to be even lower so we're gonna

00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:57,100
continue working on in this space but so

00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:00,690
in the ping UX we always say well there

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,690
might be a 10 restriction that we missed

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:11,410
we used a computer version to do the

00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:13,300
detection of paved unpaved roads so what

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,680
we did essentially is classified the

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:20,620
tiles for them to essentially say is

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,940
there a paved road on this tile and then

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,730
we talked the OSM way and then saw which

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,270
tiles it intersects and then we took

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,670
sort of a majority vote on this with

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:37,480
this we managed to reach super high

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:41,440
precision and then we created a map

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:45,130
roulette with the roads that we thought

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,779
had an invalid attribute set for the

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,779
community to take a look at this

00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:02,220
we had talked about this lots of new

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:07,080
data added when we started looking at

00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:10,320
the data back in September we had a fair

00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:13,590
amount of missing road names street

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:18,600
names fair amount of missing roads that

00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:22,020
gap got felt quite consistently and well

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:31,380
by both the editorial team and the

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:34,290
community so this was another hard part

00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,290
for us because we obviously have our own

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:40,140
like a cdata model and we needed to

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,910
squeeze in the OSM data in there I think

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:45,330
what really helped is the loose schema

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:47,270
meaning only three types and then

00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,910
everything else is documented on

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:54,210
Wikipedia so that helped a lot however

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:58,140
we had to do the the parent-child

00:15:54,210 --> 00:16:01,020
relationships we had to infer that using

00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,170
geometries that was the best way to do

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:09,180
it and then modeling the 10 restriction

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:11,280
signposts that was also quite hard but I

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,150
guess we managed to do that as well

00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,080
so without further ado I want to open

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,790
this for questions

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm sure there's there's gonna be a lot

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:29,130
thank you thank you for your talks yeah

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:34,560
so there are a lot of questions so we

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:36,240
start in order like this so the the

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,600
stuff you're doing with the paved and

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,280
unpaved roads is terrific is there any

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,460
chance that you could apply the same

00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:52,230
model to in particular the US and make

00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:54,540
the data available absolutely thank you

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,660
for thank you for the interesting talk I

00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:01,250
have a question with respect to turn

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:04,850
restrictions can you give us a

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:08,059
comparative estimate how that can

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:10,760
has to come show datasets how complete

00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:13,400
they are with turn restrictions forced

00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:20,870
area how does it compare to which data

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:26,799
sets here TomTom somebody else oh I I

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:29,510
think or some still lags behind others

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:33,110
as I said I think we miss about then

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:36,980
10,000 real-world ones I don't know how

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:47,230
how many of them others have I know that

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:49,909
osm is missing 10k okay thank you

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,750
you said that you did astray Lea because

00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:55,429
partly because of geopolitical stability

00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,380
you come from the Balkans and so my

00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:58,970
question would be would you imagine

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,309
doing the same in a place like

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,549
Afghanistan for example or any war-torn

00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:07,490
country what would be the problems in

00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:10,549
doing this work oh absolutely so we do

00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:12,500
expect to have issues with that we we

00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:16,220
sort of didn't want to jam everything in

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,929
there but we're gonna use we're gonna

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,880
craft the data in such a way that it's

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:24,679
consistent with Microsoft policies on

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,179
geopolitical situations so we're gonna

00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:31,370
have to modify the data one way or

00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:33,950
another yeah from the technical point of

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:36,080
view are the hardships for that adjust

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,179
we have to remodel that and we carve the

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:44,630
data on our end it's not it's not too

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:46,580
dramatically hard so on one of the

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,600
slides you mentioned that for some data

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:53,390
sources you secured and like exception

00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,460
or something by for or DPL or something

00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,890
like that so could you elaborate on that

00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,320
a little bit more yeah so so we work

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,000
with the local community to help get

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,830
cc-by waivers with the local government

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,090
so Australia and it's different you know

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,039
it's various states eight or nine states

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,530
sort of have open data policies but they

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,970
all slightly different and so we work

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,919
with a local community to go to the

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,360
government agencies and get make make

00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,640
sure the data is compatible with OD BL

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,929
we created a new wiki for that

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,970
and we put all the verifications and

00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:21,440
official letters inside of that wiki and

00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,390
made that available to the broader

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,309
community and sort of sort of used you

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,750
know the Microsoft resources to unlock

00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:33,710
additional data at scribe writing

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:36,890
sources of ground truth in Australia you

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,559
added XYZ information which is not less

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,690
a necessity available like today on OS m

00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,940
but you can reference this data set that

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,919
you helped procure from the government

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,159
etc as ground truth for the edits you've

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,659
just made that's right yeah so so

00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,519
there's someone every case when when RT

00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:53,510
makes it edit we use the you would talk

00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:54,889
to the community to make the proper

00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,820
source attribution tag so we know

00:19:54,889 --> 00:20:00,649
exactly where that data came from so how

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,330
did you come up with the numbers on the

00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:04,909
turn restrictions because I would love

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:08,210
to repeat the exercise for other

00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:11,090
countries rather we come up with that so

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:16,250
we essentially sampled a lot of routes

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:18,740
and then we kind of saw where we are

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:22,490
missing turn restrictions based on

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,529
locking street side imagery satellite

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,059
images of horizontal signalization and

00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:30,110
then we essentially extrapolated this

00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:35,840
across the number of the restrictions

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:38,590
that we actually have in there for a

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,590
couple of question

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:48,330
hi in your building extraction work is

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,780
the focus solely on foot footprint

00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:53,220
generation are you also working to

00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:56,850
extract any kind of attributes like

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,850
height or land use type usage no no

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,960
we're just doing the footprints uh

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,550
essentially for the other information we

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,820
would need to leverage other sources

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:07,980
other than non satellite imagery but we

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,600
definitely want to explore this field

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:17,460
further so such as areas of interest etc

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:23,870
Heights the cube there are other

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,870
