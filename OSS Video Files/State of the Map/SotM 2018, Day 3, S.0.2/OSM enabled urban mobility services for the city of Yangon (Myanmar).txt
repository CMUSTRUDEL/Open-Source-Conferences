In recent years, many projects involving OSM and mobility were developed in different countries either for commercial or humanitarian purposes. In the city of Yangon (Myanmar), road and public transport networks have dramatically evolved over the last decade and there was no updated map available. 5T and Ithaca have promoted the use of OSM as reference for Urban Planning activities in an Italy-Myanmar cooperation project, involving Yangon Municipality and focused on urban mobility. The project staff organized remote and on-site training and a mapping party event, so that local technicians learned about the use of open geo technologies and applied them by collecting data about the whole city public transport network. After surveyed data inclusion in OSM database, GTFS files were created from OSM to provide new services for citizens through a route planner. Even after the project completion, local technicians are still updating transport network on OSM to maintain an updated map of the area.
