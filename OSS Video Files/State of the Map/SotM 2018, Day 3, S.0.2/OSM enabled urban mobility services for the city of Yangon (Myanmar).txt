In recent years, many projects involving OSM and mobility were developed in different countries either for commercial or humanitarian purposes. In the city of Yangon (Myanmar), road and public transport networks have dramatically evolved over the last decade and there was no updated map available. 5T and Ithaca have promoted the use of OSM as reference for Urban Planning activities in an Italy-Myanmar cooperation project, involving Yangon Municipality and focused on urban mobility. The project staff organized remote and on-site training and a mapping party event, so that local technicians learned about the use of open geo technologies and applied them by collecting data about the whole city public transport network. After surveyed data inclusion in OSM database, GTFS files were created from OSM to provide new services for citizens through a route planner. Even after the project completion, local technicians are still updating transport network on OSM to maintain an updated map of the area.

hi i'm roberta and we will quickly

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,370
introduce myself so i work for a company

00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,389
local public administration owned

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,960
company name the five team and we

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:21,900
provide the services consultancy and we

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,439
develop project for mobility and our

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,070
business sector our traffic public

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,070
transport in probability and seeking the

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,940
project i will talk about was done

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,280
jointly with a non-profit association

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,180
named the ithaca that needs a bed based

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,120
in mercury that is a center of research

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,100
and devoted to support humanitarian

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,129
activities in response to natural

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:55,680
disaster and using remote sensing

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:58,500
technique so i will talk about city

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,920
named youngin that is one of the main

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,399
myanmar city it was capital of the

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,990
country

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,979
until 2005 and has more than five

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,659
million inhabitants and is still growing

00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:17,750
because there is a lot of migration from

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:22,950
rural area so in the city when we

00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:25,920
started the project we found this

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,509
situation the number of private car was

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:36,840
doubled in very few years between 2011

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:40,590
to 2015 and as a consequence the the

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:45,829
mean speed drop and from 30 kilometers

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:48,810
per hour to 10 or 15 this is caused by

00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:54,990
reduction on an existing limitation that

00:01:48,810 --> 00:02:00,570
was actual until 2012 because there were

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:03,140
limitation on the import of car in the

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,969
same time with the growing number of

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,340
private car the number of public

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,610
transport user

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:16,180
drop down and decrease at a rate of

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:19,940
about 10% per year and this is cause

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:24,110
also because the service is very bad at

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:27,920
a very bad quality and so user prefer

00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:34,190
take their car and not use the public

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:38,020
transport to change this situation the

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:41,500
younger municipality has the target to

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:45,470
renew their public transport network and

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:49,880
to do some traffic engineering but in

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:53,480
the area because it's very fast fastly

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,180
growing many big company from other

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,510
country are interested in because there

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:03,590
are very much business opportunity a

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:07,550
loss for example the advertisement for

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:13,130
new bus stop and a new traffic control

00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:16,370
room and a new city master plan I've

00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,709
mentioned public transport there are

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,140
there were some issue on these public

00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:23,660
transport services for example the

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,769
service very low because they're very

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:30,230
regular timetable and then the safety

00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:33,440
level is very low was dangerous and

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,480
there were limitation of the on the

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,329
entry of new player because there were

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:42,260
regulation that were favourite favourite

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:49,670
only for the existing player and avoid

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:51,410
the insertion of the new player to

00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:56,900
change the situation

00:03:51,410 --> 00:04:01,130
then there are three solution so better

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:07,060
managed operator establish regular stops

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:11,120
and rationalize route in this bar chart

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:15,349
you can see I'll change the situation in

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,799
in ten years because in 2004 there were

00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:23,030
about a thousand million passengers per

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:26,660
year and ten years later in 2014 there

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:33,650
were about the elf about five hundred

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:35,660
percent medium so to change this

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,540
situation will establish the zoom

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:44,120
project this project was funded under

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:49,250
the European European program and was

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:53,330
started in 2014 and ended in the first

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:56,660
half of 2017 partner of this project

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:59,300
were the municipality of shooting and 50

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:03,260
as a subcontractor the municipality of

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:06,650
Yangon Etica and has been the target of

00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,789
this project was to reinforce the skill

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:13,330
of the public administration on the

00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:16,940
Yerba mobility planning and to allow

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:20,090
sustainable urban environment the

00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,650
project works on three level as the

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:27,620
institutional technological and

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:32,060
educational but our is the some project

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:37,000
related to OpenStreetMap so I said that

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:40,729
young Ghana was changing quickly and

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,450
because of the all of these changing

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:50,510
there are the rare nomads with all the

00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:53,060
information updated so we have 50 and

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,510
Ithaca suggests the administration to

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,900
use OpenStreetMap because including we

00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:05,450
already use a pen street map we haven't

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:08,330
found any problems for our necessity so

00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:13,160
we suggested to do a survey activity on

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:15,789
bus route and stops and then to upload

00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,789
all the data collected data on

00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:18,789
OpenStreetMap

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:32,539
so we do with the training with the

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:34,580
force that the first phase was an

00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:37,789
analysis of the existing public

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:42,400
transport schema in Yangon

00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:47,749
there were free mode of transport bus

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:53,680
railway and water bath that is like a

00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:58,930
fairy so we choose which type to use and

00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:02,300
then we taught them how to use

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:07,069
OpenStreetMap because none of them have

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:11,059
had ever map before and so we have to

00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:13,819
teach them so this is a stop it's like a

00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:19,580
point you have to call highway equal bus

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:24,080
stop and the difficult thing was to show

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:28,089
how with a relation because usually a

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:32,839
newbie map a previously point or line

00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:37,189
but a relation is not so easy to to

00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:40,999
learn if you haven't marked before so

00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:46,639
after they upload all the data into

00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:52,879
OpenStreetMap and then we did some track

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:56,539
and validation phase so we use a Java

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:59,990
editor because for repel elation is very

00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:02,270
useful and it's easy to manage relation

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:09,409
and to check if it is okay if there are

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:12,439
all stops to check if all was okay we we

00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:15,649
used all my user history because we know

00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:19,639
the user name of matter there were about

00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:26,180
four or five matter and so we can see

00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:29,509
the change that they did that then

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,990
always - as verification tool we use

00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:37,640
overpass to count how many relation

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:40,940
had upload and then the old my relation

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:48,050
analyzer because it's always useful to

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:51,920
see the correctness of the relation okay

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:55,399
so the survey face start in the second

00:08:51,920 --> 00:09:01,339
part of 2016 so you can see the first

00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:03,290
picture that is almost empty then the

00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:08,570
second one is that at the end of the

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:14,360
project there are much more data but it

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:17,240
passed almost higher and this is because

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,279
during the project there was a change in

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,860
the political scenario so with the

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:28,000
project we have to slow down activities

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:28,000
in order to wait the stable situation

00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:38,570
but why we suggest to upload all data

00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:42,700
into OpenStreetMap because our idea was

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:46,220
to build from open three top edge ETFs

00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:52,540
how many of you use or know what is a

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:57,290
ETFs okay so I can explain what it is a

00:09:52,540 --> 00:10:03,350
standard we say that it's used them to

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:07,370
describe public transport service it is

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:10,160
a zip file that contain some text file

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,910
each one related to a specific topic for

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,740
example there is one on agency and

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:20,690
contain the name of the agency contact

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:24,579
name the address the language other four

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:28,940
route where there are a list of route

00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:31,339
stops calendar that means when operates

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,060
the service for example from July to

00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:39,820
December the shape which is the route

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,820
truck and the timetable

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:49,090
so we identify a procedure to create

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,360
gtfs starting from a street map you can

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:57,010
see a small diagram that show it

00:10:52,360 --> 00:11:02,560
so we download the route and stop Stata

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:06,760
as a JSON and G Peaks then we run a PHP

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:12,370
script that transform this data into a

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:16,540
text file useful for GTFS and at this

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:21,220
point we can upload the this partial

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:23,260
GTFS into a GTFS editor and then we can

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:33,280
head missing data and the file is

00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:36,330
complete we use overpass and quick Ozma

00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:41,800
to extract data from OpenStreetMap

00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:45,360
because we were able to do query but our

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:49,590
friend in yangon were not able so they

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,570
must be able to use this tool again so

00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:55,290
other paths as a wizard the tool that is

00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:58,900
very useful also for people that down

00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:06,820
code or can use database so it's a

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:11,070
usable easy usable by everyone ok we can

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:15,160
see the two sources to do this DFS

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:19,660
because stops comes from of the street

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:23,950
map route come from Open Street Map the

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:26,380
geometry from the relation and if the

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:29,230
relation is well described we can

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:33,370
extract information on the route for

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:38,610
example the name the code a color it is

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,610
and the agency that's the operator tag

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,370
information that are missing I'll are

00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:49,620
related to time because in OpenStreetMap

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:53,520
we can store this kind of information so

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:57,150
we customize our tool that

00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,820
the transit confirm that is based on a

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:04,350
conveyor project that is named the GTFS

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:09,300
editor I think now it's called the GTFS

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:12,030
lib and with this tool we add missing

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:17,220
data as calendar and time table or

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:20,720
frequency this was one of the difficult

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:24,530
part because Ian gone bust

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:29,310
didn't have a timetable or a frequency

00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:37,380
so it's a problem to build the GTFS so

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:42,890
we decide and estimated frequency suite

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,890
about frequency and then we did this DFS

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:49,200
so we were able after the survey

00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,130
activity and the upload activity to

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:57,960
create a 3d DFS one for every transport

00:13:53,130 --> 00:14:02,190
mode a big one for bus network with 83

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:06,930
routes one for train network and the one

00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:12,090
for water bus we provide that these feed

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:17,330
through the local government so they can

00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:20,640
use it to enable services for citizen

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:23,400
for example at the end of the Swamper

00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,460
project there was an application Obul

00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,880
application that now everyone can

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:33,990
download and the citizen can plan a trip

00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:38,570
in yangon and it's very useful for them

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:45,480
and now the local technician are able to

00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:47,730
edit officers map data and to process of

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,960
a street up to build a GTFS and to

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:55,470
update their data and we hope these

00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:59,220
three feet are publicly available in

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:05,190
order to build a new application from

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:06,220
sedum and after the project completion

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,120
we

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:13,840
did some check on Pacific lab to see if

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:17,680
the situation was the change and we saw

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:21,670
that young gun technician I've had a lot

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:26,280
of data because obviously the the

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:29,740
network is changed a lot and they have

00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:33,790
continued to upload the data into the

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:37,510
opposite of database so now they are

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:42,280
autonomous to edit and to create their

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:50,530
data for citizen and thank you for your

00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:53,280
attention thank you very much if someone

00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,280
have some question

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,939
hi I'm curious like on one of your

00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,470
slides towards the end you mentioned

00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:08,019
that after all this work there's a

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,660
consumer application like I think my

00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:13,720
mobiie app or something that you know

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,549
could you share a little like is this

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,739
something that the government build is

00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:19,739
this something you guys built for Yangon

00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:28,449
was part of the project so now it's

00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:30,489
available to the to the city I know that

00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:33,249
there are also other application

00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:37,209
available so people can download what it

00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:40,799
prefer we we focused on the GTFS

00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:43,749
creation because in our opinion was or

00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:47,049
important because it enables other

00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:49,919
services also from independent developer

00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,919
and the zone

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,620
[Music]

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:11,919
hello I'm very interested to your table

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,100
just to clarify you you map roads right

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,880
sorry

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:20,209
you map road networks yeah yeah road

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,399
network well was already in awesome okay

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:27,350
so so do you take into account the type

00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:33,710
of roads like if it's concrete or is it

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:36,649
under construction you don't either do

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:40,730
you take into account the type of the

00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:43,990
road if the road either if it's concrete

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:47,389
or not or if it's under construction

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:50,929
going on in the road we didn't focus on

00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:55,100
this side because we haven't much time

00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:57,259
for the project because initially the

00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,679
focus was on public transport so we have

00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:02,990
only a few months to do all this stuff

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:07,580
so we have to choose what to upload and

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:10,759
what not but I know that Yangon

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:15,049
technician are still working on it so ok

00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:17,620
and also road network and in all changes

00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:17,620
in city

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,460
okay if you are no more question thanks

00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,460
