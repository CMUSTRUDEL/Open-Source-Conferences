Title: 2019: OSM Quality Mapping : Metrics to monitor Buildings outbounds
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, Hörsaal Ost
Description: 
	Mapathons and Imports represent a Quality Challenge for the OSM community. This presentation focuses on Buildings. It presents Metrics and show progress of tools development to monitor and correct Quality problems in the OSM database or before importing.

Mapathons and Building import projects represent major OSM Quality problems to monitor. Potentiel 3.0 and OSM-RDC started a project in 2018 to monitor Data quality problems. We  present the work done with metrics to monitor quality problems among various Projects (see [OpenDataLabRDC Blog Articles about Building Quality](https://opendatalabrdc.github.io/Blog/#!index_en.md) ).  Individual building geometries are evaluated and classified (ie. orthogonal, quasi-orthogonal or irregular).  Topological errors are detected (ie. incomplete polygon, self-crossing, overlaps).  Geojson visualisations and Statistics let evaluate a project.  Output of List of osm_id's for various problems (ie. topological error, irregular building) let's import simply into JOSM with Overpass queries.

Current development is to go a step further and correct buildings quasi-orthogonal angles in an OSM file taking into account neighbor buildings to avoid distorsions with blocks of buildings aligned on a street (See [OQ_Analysis](https://github.com/pierzen/OQ_Analysis)). 

Programming is based on the Osmosis schema, Python and PostgreSQL-PostGIS.  OSM files to analyse can be imported from various sources (ie. Geofabrik, Overpass, osm export). Each OSM file (specific date-Zone) is converted to PosGIS and stored in a specific  PostgreSQL schema via Osmosis.  The topological analysis and geometry measures are made with PostGIS functions.

all right thank you everyone and now we

00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,990
have Pierre Beyond who will be talking

00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:20,320
about the quality of OpenStreetMap data

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,880
with respect to buildings some of you

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,900
know me as Pearson

00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:32,019
I started collaborating to osm with IT

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:34,870
in 2010 from 2012 all the majorette osm

00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:38,530
responses for disaster I did coordinate

00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:40,839
so have a lot of experience with mapping

00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,540
project tasking manager projects

00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:46,449
thousands of contributors coming and

00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:49,479
coming and making a lot of errors and we

00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:53,049
started to be worried with Nepal with

00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:56,040
8,000 people in one month we realized

00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:59,769
that there was a lot of na Pathan with

00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:02,409
unexperienced mappers this did create us

00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:05,350
a lot of problems but he later said we

00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:09,070
we don't want to validate buildings

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:12,210
anymore it's so terrible then I see in

00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:15,610
various other places more and more and

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,310
last year with Sir Lu which has just

00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:22,720
sits here Tara Lutheran OpenStreetMap

00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:25,960
Congo we started a project to to support

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,530
open city in Kinshasa at the same time

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:33,550
Ebola started in north of Kili so we had

00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:36,180
to go back to North evil in 2012 with

00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:42,010
Clare with already odd map that area

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:44,830
around gamma and so again we take care

00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,979
of that we decided we will develop a

00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:51,640
tool to monitor data quality with

00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:55,930
buildings its own AZ so some elements

00:01:51,640 --> 00:02:00,659
are already in data quality tools such

00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:03,760
as Osmos even gsm does a lot of things

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:07,150
to topological errors things like that

00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,509
but about geometry what can you do about

00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:14,590
geometry what is a right angle what is a

00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:17,470
irregular angle you you have to play

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:22,690
with that so my solution was to measure

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:26,020
the angles and the and say if an REI

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:30,130
takes her be boxer a Fanny area and if I

00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:33,340
have to to many irregular angles then I

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:36,400
should should look troller so that's it

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,680
basically what I was sure to you I won't

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,040
enter too much in detail of the the

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:46,270
functions of the PostgreSQL posture is

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:50,530
function we'll talk more about what we

00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:53,350
try to to identify and what we can do

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,010
with that what we cannot do with it the

00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:00,220
limits of models like that

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:05,100
we we are not only the the mappers well

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:07,930
so have now their imports the I projects

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,720
themselves can create some problem so I

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,910
will talk briefly about that also and at

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,460
the end if I have time I will show you

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,120
the the various tools on it's already on

00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,950
github

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:23,770
we also have a blog open data lab the

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,920
RDC we we did publish last year some

00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:32,440
analysis so in the publication you will

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:36,390
have all the detail about this so as I

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:42,760
was saying you you have the address here

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:45,790
open that I have DRC github you and

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:50,980
geometry imprecision you you you have an

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:52,870
example we see a lot of these in general

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,630
these are rectangular buildings that

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,610
have been traced by new mappers they

00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,860
come for one hour two hours three hours

00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,770
and they leave a lot of problem like

00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,420
that so you try to identify identifiers

00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:09,400
area where there's a lot of this problem

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,190
the same with intersection self

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:17,169
intersections and other polygons that's

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:19,630
another problem to identify and to as

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:22,930
compared to us most the objective also

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:25,680
is to not to look at one building at the

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,419
time but to have an overview of your

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,030
when you manage a big project you you

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,580
know you need to know what is the city

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:39,820
about the data quality you knew you need

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:43,270
some matrix these are examples taken

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:46,870
from the data where we are it's also

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:50,770
shows the type of output that come out

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:53,770
of the of the tool you see here that we

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:57,940
have been able to identify our buildings

00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:02,280
that overlaps over each other overlaps

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:06,550
over the road and the blue ones it's

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,330
let's say I take a historical file a

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,960
year ago

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,880
I look at it and I can place it over in

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,670
the background it's the data as it is

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:21,090
today so I can use overpass or I can

00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:21,090
create a JSON file from from Bochy is

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:30,550
another case here also its target area

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:38,650
agalya's new building tag it looks like

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:41,410
buildings I mean more or less and other

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,710
problems come with imagery more we have

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,930
a major e more we have problems which we

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,330
sometimes have all the imagery a new

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,150
imagery is not as good it does not have

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,340
the same offset and if you have various

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,890
group that come to caliber collaborate

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,560
and start to use the various images you

00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:02,530
have conflicts of addition like that one

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,170
group tracer building the other group

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,360
traced quite differently and deliver all

00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,810
of these data there and it can stay

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,590
there for years especially in Africa in

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:17,290
country workers no not many contributors

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:21,010
local contributors if you don't go back

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:26,260
if you don't have a good process with

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:29,820
all these Matata then then the database

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,820
is impacted in the area

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:41,530
and with Clara and what this is named

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,440
Frederick one fairly recommen did work

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,490
for who he was in the temple there was

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,690
an emergency

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:53,380
and they told us the data is terrible we

00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:55,660
cannot do anything with this data and we

00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:59,380
look at it we measure it from the

00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:01,510
information with refer to we go daily

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,450
and see oh it evil way and we had to

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:09,970
took the take the decision we scrub this

00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:13,840
and we restart so so the you see the

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:17,020
type of data we had it was was just

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,710
impossible and and every date was worse

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,350
and worse

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:23,440
so we reused the tasking manager

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,500
straight from the beginning at that time

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:34,300
we said we only want experienced mappers

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:38,230
no beginners see again in detail last

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:44,050
year I took 15 tasking managers that

00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:47,890
were map in August 2008 and they were

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,740
every there were contributors that

00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,570
validated through the tasking manager

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:57,130
you would expect well the better quality

00:07:52,570 --> 00:08:02,440
if it has been validated and it shows

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:06,130
all the tools can be used these are 15

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:10,510
projects did vary a lot you you add one

00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:15,730
one in particular project tasking

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:19,110
manager 14 7 75 60 percent of the

00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:23,260
buildings were identified as irregular

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:29,560
what I call regular is a either an angle

00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:33,520
is between 88% and 92% of 2 degrees from

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,919
90 or if it's an exact octagon a regal

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,010
roaring ghoul again I would accept 2

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,680
degree variation then we call these

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:43,329
regular the order without irregular sirs

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,019
are irregular build

00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:50,259
but in general three five percent not

00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:52,869
sixty percent when when uses something

00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:55,959
like that you go back to the data and

00:08:52,869 --> 00:09:02,799
you see example like did show before

00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:05,559
other project it is very less but you

00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,259
see rapidly either a project in

00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:11,110
particular or an area in particular you

00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:26,920
you can monitor rapidly with with such

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:29,379
two example where you see buildings and

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:34,629
the police are not detected one year

00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:39,999
later I reran last month I rerender this

00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:45,129
and I see that it's still there and on

00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:46,809
the right you see that that's why those

00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:49,869
see the same thing oh I see the next

00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:53,730
around listen okay I on my screen and I

00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:59,049
have two images I see the next image

00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:01,749
here's the one with which qsm you can

00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:04,899
click on any polygon and have the

00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:07,809
information you see here that there's

00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:11,459
even duplicate people are not only

00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:17,439
overlapping but also creating duplicates

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:20,889
that's a lot of problem like that and

00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:23,919
this year I want you to compare versus

00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,239
the tasking manager I showed the 16

00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:30,540
towns around the world

00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:33,540
Cambridge okay Adelberg Kyoto Japan etc

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,540
in

00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:40,600
at out even if I take ten cities it

00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:43,779
would be quite different from beginners

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,709
using the tasking manager but then I had

00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:50,110
another surprise

00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:55,059
it's a I see you and you you have more

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:56,980
complex data shame Oh in cities like 3d

00:10:55,059 --> 00:11:01,690
shimmer people that don't

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:06,240
properly you you Outland use tags that

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:13,930
overlap buildings or order other type of

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:17,139
polygons you imports were a lot of

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:20,230
problem arise I did compare Toronto with

00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:25,589
Dallas the road to was data provided by

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:30,820
statistic Canada and I found 54% of the

00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:35,230
buildings that did have irregular angles

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:39,010
Dallas which comes from Microsoft only

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:43,029
14% so you would think that Microsoft is

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:47,829
better than statistic Canada will come

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:50,320
back and we also has also found a lot of

00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:54,760
layers collision in Cambridge and Kyoto

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:59,230
I will show you some example see we can

00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,240
we can identify the buildings that that

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:05,050
share knows that they are adjacent and

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,149
they are connected and if it's a town as

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,730
a lot of these buildings I think it's

00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:13,240
more complex and you have more risk to

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:19,740
to have problems so here I showed the

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,740
area of Toronto that I didn't arise and

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,970
another problem was that the data did

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:31,180
have access a detail over straight-line

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:35,199
a lot of points and not always on a

00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:38,560
straight line and that that was

00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:43,420
important as is I think it it's not it's

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:46,389
not okay it should be clean example area

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,870
and Cambridge a collision or the

00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:53,370
University on over here it's a

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:56,829
commercial area so you see you see these

00:12:53,370 --> 00:13:00,880
3d Simo where buildings are not

00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:03,449
identified in inside say it's a part of

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,449
the building

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:15,950
and here you see retail polygons that

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:20,000
overlap buildings this second example

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:27,790
it's a university land which the

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:31,010
retailer trust the the land in Kyoto you

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:34,880
hear this first slide I show the

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:38,560
overlaps of buildings the the second

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:43,460
slide I show buildings overlap with with

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:47,950
three three polygons use you see de it's

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,950
it's quite square but a lot of problems

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:54,020
so Joe matric classification how to

00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:59,360
analyze the angles so I give the details

00:13:54,020 --> 00:14:01,820
so 82 to 92 I call it regular then the

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,050
second one is CAHSEE regular or

00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:12,110
irregular so it's it's more for analysis

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:18,010
to see how it spread the data and we we

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:22,780
classify the information and we then

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:27,050
actually routes variables in the model

00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,580
here I give examples I had in my sample

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:32,120
of the oldies

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:36,620
tons area I had 2.7 million buildings

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,660
it's not a fair sample because some area

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,750
we you have a lot of building some area

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:47,630
are small but still it gives an idea for

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:49,850
15 million angles I have on I have one

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,950
question question of these points are on

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,870
a straight line so you can have a line

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,400
word or point some time that's okay but

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,740
you don't

00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,590
will not count that as angles then the

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:04,280
auricular angles that's almost 92

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:07,250
percent 93 5 I don't take care of the

00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,280
the points on the straight line and so

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:13,730
in general the irregular our rally

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:18,200
achieved we were actively small 6% of

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:20,480
the of the the angles are irregular but

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,650
as I showed before it varies a lot from

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,990
one project to the other shall go

00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:32,660
further okay so the the data is

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:34,990
published on github it so I'm Aris open

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:39,550
that ODB L and you think that we

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:43,490
evidently do from OpenStreetMap is dbl

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:47,480
the the type of functions that we see

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:50,000
her it's quite simple it's it's inside

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,550
PostgreSQL it's a function so you just

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,780
need to call a function like here select

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:58,630
it's a selects from Toronto Canada and

00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:02,290
that's it it will produce the result

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:05,450
example of the result here I'm using a

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:08,810
JSON variable that's it's more flexible

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:11,570
to enter many analysis variables if

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:15,170
later we want to revise it would be easy

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:18,550
to add one more variable in into it and

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:22,280
I identified buildings and other

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:25,640
polygons when the geometry of buildings

00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:29,000
and also comparable buildings the

00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:35,180
buildings polygons that that trust each

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:39,380
other the the workflow there's a script

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:42,850
warrior you import the data into post

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,830
GIS using the osmosis Chima it it says e

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,710
are so published later but I have other

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:52,120
screw myself I go directly from overpass

00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:55,760
our step were I read from overpass then

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:59,150
then passed this to to post GIS it's how

00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:03,320
I can analyze a Mainieri at the same

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:05,330
time and then in in post GIS as we saw

00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,130
it's a simple function to produce the

00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:12,040
indicator from there you can analyze or

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:15,459
publish with you

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:19,839
format published the polygons the

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:24,310
buildings so the documentation is on

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:29,850
github Pearson OQ analysis there is just

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:29,850
creep and various documentation and

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:38,250
audiences on the puja is function I

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:46,450
thought I had an example for the import

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:51,250
I said that would come back this week I

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:57,520
found that Microsoft did wish new

00:17:51,250 --> 00:18:00,070
buildings for Africa and on the blog you

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,440
look at the image you see that the

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:06,430
building are rectangular they correct it

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,770
but it doesn't correspond with the what

00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,960
you see in the background and discussing

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,690
with the developers we see that there

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,120
are problem even if you work with a AI

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,400
it's not perfect it depends the measure

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,470
you who you are using you are various

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:26,320
problem possible with that and it was

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:29,020
evidently image quality there while in

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,720
Dallas it did look a lot better so we

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:36,820
still need to to be careful about these

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:41,400
various import project so that's my

00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:44,210
presentation will pass two questions

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,309
thank you so much here

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,309
[Applause]

00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:54,799
so do we have any questions

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:11,230
it's just a comment so my name is Claire

00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,490
ham from OS MDRC we've been working with

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,730
I mean

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:17,980
collaborating with ya for about eight

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,070
years and I met him for the first time

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:25,510
yesterday so that's something yeah in

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:27,580
person so in in a country like DRC where

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:31,330
it's huge and there are lots of

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:34,380
different mapping initiatives where most

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:37,510
of them are coming from external

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,570
initiatives to the OSM community it's

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:43,480
been really useful initiatives and tool

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:46,150
to be able to make some organic

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,120
gardening and quality checks across the

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:53,110
country in areas rather than just at the

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,800
object level and it showed where there

00:19:53,110 --> 00:20:01,210
were I mean tasks with a suspicious

00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:03,430
number of edits that were done and so if

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,830
you are in a similar situation or

00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:09,630
willing to do some more quality checks I

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,630
think it's it can be pretty useful

00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:24,120
is your hand so we know where to go next

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:27,060
[Music]

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,900
thank you I'm Janet mapping Tanzania

00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:32,340
with many similar issues thank you that

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,430
was really useful I wondered if you had

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:38,220
any advice about the best way after

00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:43,140
you've found all this terrible data what

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:47,820
what's what to do with it the problems

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:50,580
count from the start often with

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,640
methadone you have too many

00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,890
inexperienced people that come from one

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,500
hour to hour to hour you don't have time

00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:01,170
to learn any demap right away and they

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,080
never come back to osm they're hit and

00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:07,620
run what we call the hit and run it's

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,170
that that's a huge problem and I saw it

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,330
from as I said from Nepal I saw it it

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,090
it's more and more and more there is

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,070
more they say we need for this crisis

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,910
for this Christmas for for this

00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:23,880
vaccination program etc but the people

00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:26,640
that start these project we don't sure

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,040
the people are trained well they don't

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,920
ask you a good coordination the tasking

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,350
manager is very good to escalate and

00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:41,640
have a lot of people but not enough

00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:44,580
coordination is ID people the trace by

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,580
and buildings in ideas is where you see

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:51,840
all these geometry and Jos em it's a lot

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,120
easier to trace a building and what's

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,640
the solution there there are probably

00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:00,150
many but we have to do it at the start

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,450
the same with their import data it's

00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:06,600
easy to correct it to make it a square

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:10,910
but does it correspond to what you see

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,910
on the imagery that's another subject

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,220
hi thank you for your presentation it

00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:20,440
was very interesting I work in the area

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,810
of research and engineering specifically

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,510
so we're very interested in buildings I

00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:29,140
was wondering if in your tools you had

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:32,320
or or if you have any thoughts about how

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:34,420
to identify and/or deal with the cases

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,380
in which several buildings are just

00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:40,300
modeled as one polygon in the map if you

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:47,260
have any ideas on how to deal with these

00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:49,270
cases so in many cases we have had a

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,730
chance to see many cases in which

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,280
buildings that in reality are separate

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:56,170
buildings are mapped together as just

00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,780
one big polygon like first of all you

00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:00,700
have terraced houses or even even cases

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,200
in which it's obvious from when you see

00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,600
the buildings that it's different

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:10,870
structures they're all modeled as just

00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:13,780
one building no polygon opinion myself

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:17,710
no I have not seen that many situation

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:20,380
no it's true that if buildings are

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,450
individual it's easier to to trace you

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,210
will have more problem in dense cities

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:28,360
but in general they I would see them

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,460
make a big block people are tracing and

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,520
zero and dividual buildings but then

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:36,580
they overlap each other and start to

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,850
have a lot of programs like that okay

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,850
thank you

00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,130
