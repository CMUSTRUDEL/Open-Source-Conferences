welcome to the next session on lightning

00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,440
talks we got five presentations five

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,380
minutes each we will start with

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,990
Mannheimer metal mech buttons just it

00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,540
feels yeah hello everyone my name is

00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,130
Robert Danziger and I've never said

00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,660
anything in less than five minutes in my

00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:31,310
life but I'll try

00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:35,239
I live in Mannheim and I've been

00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:38,239
involved since 2015-2016 in humanitarian

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:41,770
development Car Talk cartography and I'm

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,180
a member of the Bureau of cut cut oMG

00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,180
some of you know the organization I

00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,739
studied here also cartography it in

00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,520
Heidelberg

00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:54,850
besides the project here besides the

00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,230
project here I also have a project

00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,120
development project this is humanitarian

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,790
an integration of development project in

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,440
Ghana if you're interested in that we

00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,200
can talk about it some other time

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,820
anyway the project has two goals

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,469
promoting integration of new arrivals in

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:16,700
Germany and also at the same time

00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:19,159
providing humanitarian aid here you can

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:24,200
see pictures of what our mapathon look

00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:26,329
like pretty colorful and the activity of

00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,189
the project is is ridiculously simple

00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:30,289
the idea we organized a series of

00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:33,369
mapathon every four or five weeks and

00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:38,149
which recent arrivals migrants refugees

00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:41,270
others immigrants and local residents

00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:45,369
they work together in tandem unselected

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:48,740
hot Missy and hot missing maps projects

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:50,569
the somewhat to my surprise when I

00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,149
proposed this the local authorities

00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,369
integration authorities those

00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:58,009
responsible for the school's language

00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:00,919
was in fact in physically welcomed the

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:07,639
project and we've been and they've given

00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:09,890
their support the mapathon are more or

00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:13,310
less always in the afternoon there are

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:15,740
reasons for that and we hold them more

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,020
or less regularly every as I said every

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,160
four to five weeks you can see I'm not

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,780
going to go through all of this you can

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,150
see when we started

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,090
how many marathons we've had today where

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,700
we've had them the mapa tons take place

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,790
with 25 35 persons although we do i do

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,130
have i did start smaller mapathon to do

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,440
more intensive training for the for some

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,360
of the users who come back i have this

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,750
some of them new arrivals have been

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,110
taking part 10 times out of 18 marathons

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,520
so there's some support there for

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:55,250
developing more skills on the part of

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:56,780
the map Lathon users for time to look at

00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,130
that or you can see our supporters we

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,120
have a finite we received a small

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,739
financial donation from BASF the costs

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,080
are very very low because we have free

00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:10,790
use of IT infrastructure from the local

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,410
authorities and for that reason the cost

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,330
of this project very low but it's a

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:19,069
hundred percent volunteer nobody's paid

00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:23,680
for anything what I don't need to tell

00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:26,840
you here is about how the mapathon helps

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,400
humanitarian efforts and you know all

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,079
know that you wouldn't be here I don't

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,310
think if you didn't have some idea about

00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:36,890
that but we do surveys after every

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:41,769
mapathon and as far as the integration

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:44,600
aspects are concerned three areas of

00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:47,090
interests of three areas of sort of

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,120
profile themselves what the immigrants

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,359
are what the are new arrivals what they

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,329
see is valuable the first aspect is the

00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:58,100
integration aspects they map any tandem

00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:00,350
sometimes on the same computer sometimes

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,540
sitting right next to each other so the

00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,430
social contact there's language practice

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,200
these immigrants are almost always in

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,269
language schools or in integration

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,370
courses at the time I go and do

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:13,070
recruiting in these schools I present

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,750
the project and do recruiting there they

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,039
value very much getting to know their

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,840
new environment because they come out of

00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:19,340
their daily routines and they come to

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,410
this mapathon they meet people from

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,570
other language schools they learn about

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:26,330
the city their Geographic horizons

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,370
change a little bit and I should add of

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,560
course for all participants both sides

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,540
migrants and local residents that they

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,010
work together there's a

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,560
the effect is clear the deconstruction

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:40,310
of Syria typical thinking subtle

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,420
prejudices which I mean obviously no

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,440
Nazis take part in our in our map lots

00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,030
but there are people who are positive

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,700
but still using subtle project

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,680
prejudices always work themselves in the

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,590
second aspect which which is valued by

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,720
the participants mostly immigrant

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,750
partisans but also the others there is

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,370
an acquisition of skills I do want to

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,180
say though that there's a very high

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,880
level of education for many of the

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,770
participant is Syrians and Iraqis we

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,140
have architects of a physicist that

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,720
mathematician who's comes all the time

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,150
engineers but there's a knowledge

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,300
acquisition by many and so that's value

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:23,270
quite highly geographically Geographic

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,950
IT skills and even an awareness we talk

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,960
about career possibilities because

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:31,550
they're all seeking to do work

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:34,430
eventually here finally there's a real

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,350
value they see real value in supporting

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,490
other people I mean many of these

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,890
migrants have had very difficult

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:47,240
his recent histories but they haven't

00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:49,700
they really value the ability to to help

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,560
others despite their own often not

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,240
always but often difficult situation to

00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,480
be a part of a worldwide community

00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:00,050
OpenStreetMap humanitarian activity and

00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,600
yeah if I have one to have 90 seconds or

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm finished

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,900
okay then there was a little video but I

00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,030
don't think that's it's 90 seconds

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,810
anyway if you want to see the video I

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:17,330
can show it to you on my portable it's a

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,720
video showing sort of 90 seconds out of

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:24,200
the mapathon xand reactions of the of

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,910
the migrants and the local participants

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,350
how they value it it's in German so

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:31,930
probably wouldn't have done it much help

00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,930
anyway anyway that's it thank you

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,110
next presentation will be on wealth

00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,110
management

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,900
hello and welcome to this lightning

00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:23,540
toward my name is Alexander right I am

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:26,610
from the LST and I want to show you the

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:31,790
our project roadworks management system

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:35,250
in baden-württemberg called base 2.0

00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:37,410
firstly to the background to the roads

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,010
of patent gutenberg but boot mech has

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:44,820
more than 21,000 kilometers length of

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:47,490
classified roads of the more than 3500

00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,970
kilometer on highways and national roads

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:53,850
alone each year more than 400 major road

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,190
constructions have been solar lean-burn

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,890
wittenberg on the classified road

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,830
network and hundreds of smaller

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:04,590
maintenance works as they are planned by

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,200
our that centralized it administration

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,810
or for administrative regions and forty

00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,590
four districts common view is required

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:16,290
to see when and where roadworks will

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:22,080
take place in which diversion roads need

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:23,580
to be kept free of other works for this

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,860
proposed the lander still efficient

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,100
arson technique is currently developing

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:32,130
the roadworks information system second

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:35,039
edition this - it supports planning of

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,950
roadworks voiding conflicts were

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,250
possible this - supports the planner by

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,830
estimating the traffic impact of these

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:48,350
works and if possible finding better CU

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,350
the time slots to perform this works

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,040
this is a previous screenshot showing a

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,700
dialogue to capture a planned road

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,700
construction give you a few seconds

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,550
to detect conflicts between various

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,860
roadworks of the different parties we

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,740
map all roadworks onto the OSF Street

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,010
Network then we check if two routes it

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,020
meant serving each other as a fallback

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,270
route on carry roadworks at the same

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,790
time to perform this matching we

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,710
initially map matched the official

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,590
street database with the OSM street

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:28,050
network locations where we were not able

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:31,050
to match or we great a difference

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,830
between match Road segment secured

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:39,240
usually flagged data quality issues in

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:41,070
mostly of the official database we use

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,620
the route able Open Street Map network

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,260
to enter diversions during road

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:50,490
constructions in contrast to our

00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,800
official Street database osm also

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,890
contains their and classified road

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,320
network the construction planner may

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,830
either enter a diversion we are a few

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,720
clicks in the map or by just choosing

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:09,240
predefined official detour routes from

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:11,850
Open Street Map to improve the data

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,000
quality of Open Street Map detour routes

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,430
which currently is not very good we

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,440
published a list of all official detour

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,530
routes in baden-wuerttemberg under the

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,350
German data lights and zero behind the

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:28,680
scenes we are working hard internally to

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,020
get published a cartographic cata

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,420
graphic detail map as well which

00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,370
currently is still objected due to

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,700
license issues concerning the background

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,710
map the lander still official arson

00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,290
technique is looking forward to working

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,720
together with the OSM community there

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,390
are many data sets like classified road

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,030
network bridges and tunnels along roads

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,280
daily traffic volumes roadworks

00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:57,450
and so on which we are working on to get

00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:02,030
published as open data even THOG wheels

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,030
of administrations grind slowly

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,750
sorry

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,380
so even four wheels of administration

00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:17,000
spline slowly we are currently

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,740
reorganizing and well will be an

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,910
official contact point for the OSM

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,829
community soon so thank you for your

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,600
interests your attention and before all

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:28,639
all your efforts in creating and

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,500
maintaining OpenStreetMap we are looking

00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,079
forward to working with you and if you

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:48,380
have any questions we have out at a

00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:50,300
booth for information thank you the next

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:55,029
speaker will present public transport

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,029
stops and comparing them on open story

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,440
so hi everybody my name is Raghav

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,690
hopefully meet and tala we are

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,140
doing multimodal routine combining

00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,529
carpooling and public transit and public

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,540
transits

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:20,990
public transport is Christine I want to

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,029
share our insights comparing public

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,380
transport stop data from official

00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:29,270
sources nah about Micmac and

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:32,320
OpenStreetMap so in June the Norfolk air

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:35,149
gesellschaft baden-württemberg published

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,029
public transport stop data so these us

00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:40,760
stop places which correspond to stop

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:44,540
areas in OS m level which are the areas

00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:47,990
where bus and trains leave and arrive

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:51,950
and a keys which are an in fact kind of

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:55,010
platform and well you wonder there were

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:58,010
some arrows in the data which will be

00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:00,890
well would make differ the matching

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,899
difficult but have to say the guys at

00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:07,310
the Norfolk a special pod would really

00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:10,910
responsive of a few time a few weeks

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:13,910
after we contacted them and told them

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:18,800
about these issues already a quarter of

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:21,170
them resolved so on the other hand open

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,910
transport OpenStreetMap public transport

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,920
stops well there are different data

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,279
models in OpenStreetMap you know perhaps

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,470
about it PTV one for example bus stops

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,320
are just indicated by a highway tag

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:39,350
equals bus stop the name route Ref

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,600
perhaps + PDV - is a bit more

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:47,620
complicated that we have a public

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:49,850
transport platform perhaps we have IDs

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,370
the highway bus stop should be

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,170
maintained for compatibility

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,360
compatibility reasons which is not

00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:00,980
always the case but should and then we

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:04,250
have stop another note the public

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:08,990
transport stop position where the bus

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:12,740
stops and yeah it's different but well

00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:14,670
there as well we have some varieties how

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,520
the public stop

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:20,790
data is mapped Tech's are missing

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:25,590
sometimes it's the name or it's not

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:27,890
neither PTV you to know PTV one IDs are

00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:31,380
have typos in them and so on

00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:35,490
nevertheless we try to match them and

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:40,220
what did we match we match the official

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:45,240
stop for bus for buses we match to the

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:47,040
platform and for rail bound transports

00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,820
we matched with the stock position and

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,680
we took into account name resemblance

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:56,760
the mode resemblance is at bus as a

00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:59,370
train the key so the key number or

00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,560
letter perhaps distance how far away are

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,440
these candidates these match candidates

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,320
and perhaps if given their directions

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,530
the next stop equivalent so these are

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,770
details how we do this perhaps can talk

00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:17,010
about later so well we are still not

00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,360
perfect our matching has many issues for

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:22,260
example we are very sensitive to

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,290
incomplete tagging so this is here take

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,150
no be parked there are some notes with

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,940
which have missing text and we mismatch

00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:32,730
them them and what is difficult for us

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,120
as we have no stop sequences we

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:38,670
sometimes mismatch left and right-hand

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,010
side of the street but perhaps this will

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:44,840
be better if we match with gtf test data

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:48,540
nevertheless this gives an impression

00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:52,140
about the matching results we are able

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:54,990
to match about half of the official

00:15:52,140 --> 00:16:00,620
stops and the green ones a quarter of

00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:04,710
them we did not match we could not match

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:08,880
completely not match and the light red

00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:10,380
ones there's at least one stop one

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,830
platform which we could were able to

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:19,080
match and what we are the insides we had

00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,880
well authoritative locations official

00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,980
locations are often inaccurate we have

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,510
sometimes more than 100

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:32,820
meters of difference they are they have

00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:35,550
no validity data provided often so not

00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:38,070
often but those stops in our region I

00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:40,350
checked there where neither under

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:44,040
construction I don't under construction

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:48,329
or perhaps like here already out of

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,980
service then the name diet data is not

00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:52,380
regularly updated apparently

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,920
OpenStreetMap is more accurate on this

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,149
topic we we think and on the other hand

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,850
there are some regions in

00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:04,140
baden-württemberg where many stops are

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:07,380
still to map and yeah the data quality

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,480
is heterogeneous and my time is over so

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,059
this is the agenda what we want to do

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:34,380
further and well perhaps we have

00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:40,429
questions picker of Geo chicas is he or

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:44,210
she around if not and we'll proceed with

00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:48,049
the last lightning talk that's called

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,049
open 12 you

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:13,640
thank you

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:19,290
hi so my name is Nick white like I did

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,549
was that presenting properly yeah okay

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,860
so my name's Nick white like I did

00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:25,559
present on hi car my AR app yesterday so

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,260
here I'm I'm here today to talk about my

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:33,240
other project open trail view this is

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:35,370
basically a street view for foot paths

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,900
and trails so it's like Google Street

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,390
View in terms of what it's aiming to

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:43,080
achieve but it's focused only on

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:45,540
footpaths and trails off-road routes it

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,280
is 100% free and open source I want to

00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,700
make that up clear and I've given you

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,160
the gitlab repository URL there and the

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,460
interesting thing about it is that the

00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,370
panoramas which our user contributed are

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:03,210
auto connected using Open Street Map

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:06,059
data so what I do is I basically contact

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,520
my server I get back geo Jason and then

00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:11,669
I use an extremely useful library an

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,530
open source library buy pair leadmon do

00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:15,360
Jason Pathfinder which have given me the

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,549
URL for there and that will basically

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,970
calculate the path from one point to

00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:24,660
another given basically a network of geo

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:26,490
Jason so and the other open source

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,820
library I've used is Piniella which

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:32,910
basically is a panorama viewer library

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,540
so basically panoramas are auto

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:41,880
connected using the underlying

00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:43,799
OpenStreetMap ways okay right so how can

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,760
you contribute well but you need some

00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:51,450
sort of device to basically shoot a 360

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,970
panorama a couple of options here first

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:56,370
of all the photo spheres which are

00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,650
available on the Google camera app which

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:02,790
you may well have if you have an Android

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:04,780
device are a bit time-consuming that's

00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:08,080
the problem with you

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,910
photosphere panorama but they are quite

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,200
good quality these days that's the nice

00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,540
thing about them they're relatively good

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,640
quality you do need about 40 shots so it

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,830
does take a couple of minutes to take

00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,460
those 40 shots but then they are Auto

00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:23,860
stitched using the photosphere basically

00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,920
the Google camera app and the other

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,510
option is a 360 camera such as a reco

00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,460
theta

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,110
I've got one here it's actually borrowed

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,830
off a friend but I'll sort of a

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:37,780
long-term loan so to speak they're quick

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,730
because you can just take a single shot

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,980
like that however they do have a couple

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:44,440
of disadvantages the quality can be

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,780
poorer as you'll see in a minute and the

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,640
shooter appears in the panorama so

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,110
basically if you want to avoid yourself

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,380
appearing and obstructing the view

00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:55,240
you've got to hold it up like that

00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,060
but I believe some of the newer models

00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:04,710
of these and some of the other models

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:10,170
available are higher quality okay so I

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:14,220
do want to do a demo if I've got time

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:31,060
two minutes okay good so open trail view

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:34,810
org is windows okay okay so the URL is

00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:36,670
open trail view - org I'll just quickly

00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:40,230
log in because there's some panoramas

00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,230
which I haven't authorized yet

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:56,820
god I forgot my password you what no no

00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:06,020
it's definitely not that no not nothing

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:09,410
like sorry I forgot to forgot to

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:11,460
authorize some panoramas of Heidelberg

00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,760
but I'll just show you some in the

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,020
default location okay so this is the

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,549
suddenly where I live in Southampton the

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,950
UK so you can see there are various

00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,510
panoramas here so you can navigate from

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,400
one to the other like that and then

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:26,390
we're at a junction here you can go one

00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:31,429
of two routes so we'll go that way and

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:35,160
so on and so on and so on so basically

00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:37,950
that's what it does

00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:41,370
these panoramas were taken with a rico's

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:43,470
theta unfortunately I did forget to

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,720
authorize the panoramas of Heidelberg

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:49,020
which I took this morning but I will do

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,850
that in just a minute so if you're

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,100
interested if you want to check the

00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,140
website in about half an hour or

00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,750
probably even about 20 minutes you will

00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,370
see some photos of Heidelberg there so

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:07,679
there's a map mode and then you can just

00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:09,630
search for Heidelberg and top result so

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,790
basically check again about ten minutes

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:14,940
and you'll see various panoramas of

00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:17,610
Heidelberg a few around the castle a few

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,710
on the bridge not the altar Brooker but

00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:22,740
the other one and then a few on the

00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:26,250
philosophy vague okay

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:30,390
right I think that's time up but I'll

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:32,870
just any questions that I've got to have

00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:38,150
questions but I'm around in the break

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:38,150
and that's my contact details nice

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,609
