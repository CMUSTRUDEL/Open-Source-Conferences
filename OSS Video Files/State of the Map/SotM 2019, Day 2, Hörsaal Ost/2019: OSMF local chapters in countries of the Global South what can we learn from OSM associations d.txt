Title: 2019: OSMF local chapters in countries of the Global South what can we learn from OSM associations d
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, Hörsaal Ost
Description: 
	This talk will share lessons that OSM and OSMF members can learn about the multi-years collective dynamics around OpenStreetMap which unfold in French-speaking southern countries of Africa and the Caribbean with the view of identifying paths for local OSM grassroots groups evolution towards a formal OSMF local chapters.

It has been some years that OSM and OMSF members have been discussing the topic of OSMF local chapters over emails, wiki, physically through BoF sessions at SotM events. In 2019 the Ugandan NGO MapUganda applied to be the OSMF local chapter in this country. This talk will share lessons that OSM and OSMF members can learn about the multi-years collective dynamics around OpenStreetMap which unfold in French-speaking southern countries of Africa and the Caribbean. In these countries, since the start local OSM actions (outreach, communication, mapping and training) have been organized collectively. These actions lead to the de facto building of first informal collective of mappers which organized internally over the years and for some incorporated as local associations mandated to the promotion and support of the OSM project playing the role of a de facto OSM Chapter. The talk will look at the collective practices of these de facto OSMF local chapters in the light of the OSMF requirements but also look at the OSMF local chapters requirements in the light of this multi-years OSM associative experience with the view to identify itineraries to the building of OSMF local chapters.
Like in Milano's BoF sessions, this talk will be collectively built with African mappers involved for  many years in these activities and ideally co-facilitated by those from Western Africa successful in getting visas and traveling to Heidelberg. This talk is meant to introduce a BoF session opened to anyone active or interested in supporting the growth of OSMF local chapters connected to the pioneering grassroot collective in the hard environment of the countries of the Global South and especially southern countries of Africa.

next session that didn't change that

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,030
much here and in front of the

00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:16,189
reinvestment

00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,240
that's easy also no need to change

00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:23,419
lights and stuff so we have again

00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,800
nikolayeva and say that I mean I you've

00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:28,579
heard the last session a lot of

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,160
experience in general mapping in the

00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:33,050
global south basically so this session

00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,230
that they're gonna lead is about the

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,210
Association dynamics in in in

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,620
french-speaking Africa also with a few

00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,000
on tourism at local chapters yeah so I'm

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,190
interested but they have to say about

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,379
this and to hear also about some

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,480
experiences from from people from the

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:56,239
Global's out about this

00:00:50,480 --> 00:01:00,079
thank you luck I would just into the

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:04,129
context of because many of you do not

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,590
know the others so we are involved in

00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:12,159
OpenStreetMap into them eight into the

00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:15,460
antenna we are in the past we we were

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,829
during the very beginning of the

00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:24,790
OpenStreetMap new entrant OpenStreetMap

00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:29,299
keep us NGO and now we are presented to

00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:31,670
Association once called Jose UF that's a

00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:34,909
voluntary based and the other one is the

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:39,369
what it's called ladybug of the free

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:47,270
geographers and this is what we use for

00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:52,640
I mean economical project and say so we

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:55,850
have been active in empowering even

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,549
sometime creating community of mappers

00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:03,619
in more than 10 countries in Africa and

00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:05,899
many of represented ha are here through

00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:09,020
generally 2 weeks training the training

00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:11,570
camps funded by the organization

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:16,450
internal organization of Francophonie

00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:18,530
and so this you have this country like

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,650
synagogue were the first one

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,920
malee leisure

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:35,500
kennefa so ivory cost taco Benin and

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:38,409
recently Madagascar Congo okay and so

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,019
during this this last training that we

00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:44,650
held for two weeks with the people and

00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:49,019
the mappers from from those countries we

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:51,790
dedicated a lot of time to governance to

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:57,540
the reading of the text of the

00:02:51,790 --> 00:03:02,829
Foundation's all the the trademark and

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:05,670
the the series of text arranging the

00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:09,700
formalization of local chapters we also

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,769
paid attention to the conversations of a

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,470
mailing list and add some group

00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:17,230
discussions and understanding on that

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:21,189
with the idea to look at the current

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,799
practices that that are the one of the

00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:26,709
OpenStreetMap collectives in in those

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:31,379
countries with the view of being there

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:34,959
and intervening and putting forward some

00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:39,280
elements for consideration for the u.s.

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:43,060
MF and in the way that it wants to go

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,480
ahead with registrations of local

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:50,349
chapters in a way that can be both

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,229
respectful of the text the practices at

00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,419
work in the OpenStreetMap ecosystems

00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:56,560
which met the rubb business and the

00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:59,530
success of the project

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,569
but as well taking into account dynamics

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,900
that are very specific to those

00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:13,470
territories and that shall be cut it for

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:17,610
as well so basically the result

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,010
the result of many years of support by

00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:25,440
the organization Internacional de la

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:28,950
Francophonie into the local emerging and

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:33,050
rise of OpenStreetMap in this territory

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:38,510
is just materialized into very early

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:45,690
constitutions of special collectives and

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:50,960
and this put us into the the necessity

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:54,990
of very quickly after having given to

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,240
those those matters the technical skills

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:01,350
and some capacity-building and

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:04,790
organization skills for them to be able

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:08,730
to fulfill their activities in safety

00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,670
the need to do that collectively was

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:16,080
something that was very important

00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:18,600
because of the ite or the GIS or the OS

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,910
and backgrounds that was the one of the

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,400
art because of the learning curve in

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,710
terms of OpenStreetMap and the

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:32,640
efficiency of learning and growing

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:37,110
together and also because of the simple

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:40,250
fact that to safely map a city in those

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:43,550
territories on your own or collectively

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:46,290
being able to refer to an

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:49,530
institutionalized OpenStreetMap

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:52,230
association is one one way of just not

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,330
having problems with the people living

00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:57,600
the territories or just with the police

00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:02,490
so despite the fact that we were very

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:06,410
aware of a sort of a steep project a

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:10,500
steady process in terms of first redress

00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:13,200
registry incorporating as an association

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,230
which is not the way things developed

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,330
normally in in most of the of the

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:22,110
territory of the north where you had

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,889
some practices and at one point things

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,069
were mature enough for

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:29,740
the people to go and registered and

00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:36,539
OpenStreetMap association and then go

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:39,969
eventually the road to apply for a

00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:43,590
status of local chapter in those

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:47,199
territories that was a necessity just to

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,560
have a sort of safe framework for the

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:55,210
people that were mapping the second one

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:58,330
was due to the nature of the ite the

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:01,090
free-software and now the open data

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,099
ecosystem well you've got already

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,240
organized groups that are more or less

00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:12,460
in a novice to mystic position and that

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,990
could perhaps just registered as an open

00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,810
strip not collectives and just

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,580
marginalised the pureness that has been

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,960
doing most of the work and that have

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,279
been really making a difference for

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:30,089
OpenStreetMap locally in the countries

00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:33,629
so that was why very early associations

00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:41,229
with OpenStreetMap in the name i've been

00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:44,500
i've been started because we were very

00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:50,949
aware of the difficulties to put young

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:54,339
people into the necessity of facing an

00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:57,759
organ the the fact of operating as a

00:07:54,339 --> 00:08:01,319
collective as an organization so since

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:05,639
2014 you had some support package on

00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:08,740
organisational matters spanning both

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:12,189
techniques and governance items with the

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,439
tax of the foundations and the like the

00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:17,080
second thing that has to be cat at fault

00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:20,500
was the way for those matters that

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,259
wanted to try to make an economic use of

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,439
their skills and their ability to create

00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:29,289
and play with OpenStreetMap or open data

00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:33,729
or Jaya's data to have a way to do so

00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:34,060
with respect to what are the the common

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,990
part

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:42,849
here in in in our territories in the

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:48,450
north by most the foundations and all

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:51,850
the registered local chapters are not

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:56,740
making a commercial release of

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:59,380
OpenStreetMap and this means that for

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,930
those young people growing in Chi

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,750
OpenStreetMap putting force and

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,920
associations I was meaning that they had

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:11,800
to organize an activity outside of that

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,360
common that that common structure of

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:19,930
dens and there was a second layer of of

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,290
possible difficulties so now if we look

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:27,339
at where things stand with respect to

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:31,480
the criteria that emerged for local

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:34,320
chapters we've got obviously things that

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:40,150
that are diverse and the typology of

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:42,730
situations we can just look at some of

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:47,680
those criteria and see where things are

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:50,920
okay a local chapter is supposed to

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,560
share the goal of the foundation and the

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,300
mention of the Foundation which is

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,130
sporting the OpenStreetMap project

00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,110
without controlling it and that's

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:04,600
something which is really embedded into

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:08,000
the DNA of all those mappers the idea of

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,160
having an and

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,650
an internal governance which is

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,920
democratic is also something which goes

00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:20,870
without questions at least in in the way

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,300
that things are set out and lagged to be

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,400
a nonprofit organization and to be a

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,950
registered nonprofit organization is

00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:32,180
something that can be difficult in some

00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:37,040
countries but there is some flexibility

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:41,810
within the USNS and that's not something

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:47,240
which which is a problem in a problem

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:50,870
per se where there is something which

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:55,510
which is which is more difficult is too

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:59,480
low mass entry into our local chapters

00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:02,650
for all the fourth nine of the ten

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,480
countries that were present in enorme

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:08,770
okay for nine of the ten countries that

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,380
are present in LA may the idea of

00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:14,270
allowing into their associations someone

00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:18,290
which is not skilled at always

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:20,240
OpenStreetMap and up that someone being

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,550
able to take decisions that's the inner

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,780
level of the collective is something

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:29,230
that was seen as a problem and the idea

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,930
was to propose a sort of path by which

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,970
first you map those are those those

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:38,660
local collectives are throwing a lot of

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:41,390
mapping of training activities so there

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,970
is a way for people that just want to go

00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:46,310
into OpenStreetMap to is a self strain

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:49,130
themselves or is it just go into those

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,500
training and then other possibility of

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:54,470
entering those collectives and then

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:58,340
there was an idea that a new member into

00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:00,350
the organization as to to spend some

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,250
time just to basically learn or this

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,690
organization is working functioning

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,430
knowing the organization's and having

00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,909
the members of the organization knowing

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:14,699
in Prior being in a position

00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:22,129
to act at the inner level of this

00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:27,479
organization in a in in its board then a

00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:32,099
local chapter by formalizing the status

00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:34,639
is supposed to obey and comply with the

00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:39,659
tax of the OpenStreetMap foundations

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:43,079
namely its trademark policy this is

00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:44,609
where sometimes we've got difficulties

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,859
we've got difficulties with the

00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:49,259
understanding of what are the boundaries

00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:51,869
of community and what are the boundaries

00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:53,939
of associations and there is a tendency

00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:58,079
and the confusions about the two things

00:12:53,939 --> 00:13:02,939
but generally the picture is gotten at

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:07,199
the exceptions of given countries the

00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:12,269
second layer of difficulties if we think

00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:18,229
that not mixing economic project like a

00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:21,029
business within the local chapters or an

00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:23,879
OpenStreetMap national organization is

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:26,489
the way forward that's the way things

00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:29,939
are working in most of our SMF and local

00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:32,459
chapters then there is in given

00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:37,709
countries some difficulty in tendency to

00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:41,129
try to use DSM name and the local

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:45,599
organization as one way to make project

00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:49,470
work with with with humanitarian or

00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:54,539
development actors and despite the fact

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:57,179
that this is breaching a sort of of

00:13:54,539 --> 00:14:00,269
practices that Satna in the ecosystems

00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:02,429
and that to our mind and to have views

00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:05,039
as something which makes the robustness

00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:09,239
of OpenStreetMap this is also opening

00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:11,909
the floor in those countries for more

00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:15,239
competitions within the organizations

00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:16,820
and possibly a sort of change of nature

00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:19,170
of the

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,720
collective's moving from something

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,760
that's meant to support voluntarily the

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,260
grossman street map into something

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,610
that's going to be seen as a business

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:33,000
with client holistic relations more

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:36,330
power more control a tendency not to

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,820
Train not to work on people because then

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:42,540
they're going to potentially compete

00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,940
with with other members of previously

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,760
part of the organization with respect to

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,100
possible paid and project work and there

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,830
is a risk of more conflict within the

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:59,670
organization and also yes a risk of a

00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:05,490
risk of a change of a loss of the

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:09,080
potential of of opening and enlarging

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,730
the community that that chapter or that

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,390
Association or that informal collective

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:20,570
can fulfill so with those elements in

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:23,760
mind what could be the path for both

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:27,300
proto local chapters from the sides in

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,630
those territories of Africa and the u.s.

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:36,410
MF well I think that on the u.s. MF

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:43,530
front what is necessary is to be more

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:47,100
present and to to try to make the actors

00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:50,070
more calm compliant with with the text

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,370
and and the documents of the foundations

00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:56,340
but this is something which is not

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:58,950
specifically to be expected for a local

00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:02,580
organization which is something that is

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:05,280
also expected when some big actors from

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,380
from the TAC are just misusing or not

00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,370
obeying as per the OpenStreetMap

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,270
trademark

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:16,050
so this vigilance as to also expand and

00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:19,400
happened on the ground there is also I

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:23,040
think the need perhaps to

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,300
constitutionalize that practices that is

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,460
happening at the moment in the

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:30,200
foundations and in the registered local

00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:35,220
chapters which has been too

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:39,090
economic work within the do SMF and to

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:46,620
keep it and to keep it really voluntary

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:49,650
or let's say the outside of of the way

00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:54,360
of outside of a sort of business mind

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:56,730
frame then there is also need to be

00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,390
attentive to the localizations in terms

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:04,680
of making accessible the text of the OS

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:07,890
MF into the local language that's a huge

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,220
buyer and it was really a painful

00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,410
process to help people translating and

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:17,580
understanding the text from a language

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:21,870
which is not their language then in

00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:24,660
terms of the criteria that should be put

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:28,110
forward by people from the size we would

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,840
say that that would be its I'm just

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:34,290
taking one minutes and I'm them that

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,390
would be to be more flexible have the

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:39,840
the flexibility in terms of registering

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,640
the entity which is okay take into

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,740
consideration the fact that there is a

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:50,070
need to have as a sort of entry pass or

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,920
it's nearer a towards becoming a member

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,480
of those entity as first being active in

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,880
OpenStreetMap and taking the time

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,130
internally to notice that's not I shall

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,860
not be seen as a breach in terms of not

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:06,540
allowing mass entry and and basically we

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:10,770
will be set for a sort of long-term

00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:13,170
process whereby this the two groups

00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,120
needs to inform themselves about what is

00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,850
happening I think that the requirement

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,800
for a formalized local chapters in terms

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,110
of informing the foundations but the

00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:27,630
activity shall apply to each photo

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:29,910
chapters and we can also expect from the

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:34,440
OpenStreetMap foundation shall we've got

00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:40,700
the means voluntarily or through through

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:45,450
small small economic grants to support

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:47,820
this process of sharing to the

00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,770
foundation as a local chapters so that's

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,789
basically the elements that we wanted to

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:59,160
bring forth to the community and us MF

00:18:53,789 --> 00:19:01,770
members and I've present for this

00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,110
afternoon discussions about this

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:14,429
Congress of local chapters that used has

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:16,320
been calling for we have still time for

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:18,330
few questions

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:29,460
somebody has question or if you I don't

00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:32,100
know maybe one or two hi Sofia from MSF

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,640
I do have two questions for you if I can

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,970
so the first one it's actually how do

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,360
you think a order like big organization

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:47,190
or my Italian organization can approach

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:50,760
these local communities and how actually

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:54,299
and the second question would be is

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:57,720
there already a network between these

00:19:54,299 --> 00:20:01,260
little localities and what is the

00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:04,049
platform where they discuss is there

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,030
because you talk about competition but

00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:09,380
what about also the networking and how

00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:12,539
they use this network to actually grow

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,460
okay well thanks for the questions I'm

00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:16,260
going to start with the second and the

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,210
clarification well when I was speaking

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,850
about competition I was speaking about

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:25,260
the possibility of competition opening

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:27,990
shall a local cap a local chapters was

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,030
going into sort of a breed model by

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,210
being both a chapter and also a business

00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,940
[Music]

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:38,100
the way that we've been working and the

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,320
way that people have been active around

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,470
OpenStreetMap has been through a sort of

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,900
network and since the very first actions

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,650
you had people from Senegal are going to

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:51,400
support people from Togo

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:55,030
and people from other countries just

00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,580
working together and knowing to knowing

00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,700
each other's and developing their own

00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:05,440
toys building their own corporations

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:07,840
that some are opening through voluntary

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,390
schemes some other very tiny are

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,490
openings through economic project so

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:17,040
that's that's the first thing in terms

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:20,890
of having a sort of entry door for

00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:24,100
organization it's something where you

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:26,520
need to have some patience because there

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:30,310
is a deficit of communications about

00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:33,700
what's what's happening usually there is

00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:38,010
ways for consulting those people through

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:41,020
the wiki the mailing list and and some

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:44,500
some Twitter of Facebook handles on

00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,360
social media and in terms of the past

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,940
the recommendation will be just to try

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,950
to stick and be attentive on the way

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:54,340
that you're engaging with those actors

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:57,790
to the to make a distinctions on what's

00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:00,250
happening at the community level what's

00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:04,990
happening within the framework of an

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:10,060
associations and try not to mix economic

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:12,490
needs to to the the way that a local

00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,590
chapter is is working that would be the

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,860
recommendation that this is just the

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:21,910
view of a couple of people like 50

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:23,560
others in in in in Africa and some of

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,660
the people may have different views but

00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,990
this is something for consideration or

00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:34,000
thinking you know SNF and you know I say

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:37,060
at large what I think we're gonna need

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,220
to wrap up and thanks a lot for the talk

00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,920
and the question there is also this

00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,230
afternoon these local chapters

00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:46,390
conference conference here so join there

00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:50,260
to continue the discussion on local

00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:54,570
chapters with with more points of view I

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,570
