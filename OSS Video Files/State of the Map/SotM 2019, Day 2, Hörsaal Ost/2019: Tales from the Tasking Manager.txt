Description: 
	The Tasking Manager is OpenStreetMap’s most used software tool to organize mapathons, community mapping initiatives and professional mapping teams. Over the last year it has been developed further significantly. This talk will give an update on the newest developments and the emerging community around the application.

The Tasking Manager is OpenStreetMap’s most used software tool to organize mapathons, community mapping initiatives and professional mapping teams. Over the last year it has been further developed significantly. This talk will give an update on the newest developments and the emerging community around the application.

Based on tales of data storytelling representatives of the development team of the Tasking Manager are going to discover remarkable curiosities and insights out of a wider application and user analysis, of course backed by hard stats. From this starting point we explain the solutions we implemented in Tasking Manager in the last year to improve the user experience and increase the data quality by mappers using the tool. Three stories will be told, about group of users that are coming to the Tasking Manager frequently and how the changes affected their flow. New mappers, validators and project creators are the main actors of the exciting adventures of combating a low beginners retention rate, lifting data relicts, guiding a mapper through the labyrinth of OSM contribution and learning about the magic of people’s using technology to achieve what they want.

We will talk about the new ingredients of the Tasking Manager, from the redesign of the users interface and the interaction among them, to how it now fits into a wider spectrum with much more applications of the OpenStreetMap ecosystem in order to improve direct access to more efficient mapping and data validation.

hello welcome for those who are new in

00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:16,460
the room we have three magnificent

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,099
people fronting in the road we have

00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,539
Ramya Willie and Felix and they're the

00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:23,779
team from the humanitarian OpenStreetMap

00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:25,970
team who are working on the tasking

00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:30,109
manager who have you have used the

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:32,570
tasking manager okay so you know kind of

00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:34,730
what we're talking about and so they're

00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,559
gonna tell us about the new developments

00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:44,570
for the tasking manager so let's see

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:45,019
what that brings thanks thanks for being

00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,960
here

00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:50,809
I'm Ramya developer with humanitarian

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,869
OpenStreetMap team in short hot so with

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:55,250
me are my colleagues Willie and Felix

00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:57,860
together we are going to talk about our

00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:01,269
tool tasking manager the journey so far

00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,269
and what lies ahead

00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:08,000
so about tasking manager it's a web tool

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,549
that's used for organized editing on

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,979
OpenStreetMap the idea is that if

00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:14,630
someone like a humanitarian group wants

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:16,399
to map out a certain geography on

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,560
OpenStreetMap they could get on the

00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:20,899
tasking manager divide the area into

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,049
like a series of blocks which different

00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:25,429
volunteers can then claim and work on

00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:27,380
this shows everyone like how much

00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:29,119
progress they have made as a team and as

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,700
an individual and also make sure that

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,700
multiple people don't edit the same area

00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,319
at the same place at the same time which

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,350
otherwise would lead to like confusions

00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,749
or errors the to log in is tied up with

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,369
the OpenStreetMap username so once you

00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:45,170
create like an OpenStreetMap account

00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,609
you're all set to contribute to any

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,619
projects within the tasking manager

00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:53,960
worldwide so within the tasking manager

00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:55,729
there are like lists of mapping projects

00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,460
and each project has specific

00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:01,340
instructions on how to contribute what

00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:04,130
kind of data the project requires the

00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,619
imagery availability skill requirement

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,959
for the mappers the boundary for the

00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:10,580
projects and the priority areas that has

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,910
to be mapped first within the project

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,150
and also each project the area is

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,440
divided into like smaller tasks and

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,510
contributors can choose her tasks within

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,930
the project that is free and contribute

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,489
accord

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,519
the instructions provided within the

00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:27,290
project one day one person can work on a

00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,450
task at a given point of time the task

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,450
is autumn automatically unlocked after

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,720
to us and all the contributions are made

00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:38,450
on lake OpenStreetMap and the edits are

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,400
made using the OSM editing tools the map

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,379
is usually spent most of the time

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,930
mapping on these editing tools rather

00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:47,629
than the tasking manager itself and all

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,549
the awesome change sets from the tasking

00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:51,760
manager they have the they have the

00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,620
annotation with the hot specific tags

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,690
which means like hot contributions can

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,900
be identified later in the OSM edit

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,549
history I want to walk you through the

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,930
workflow the workflow is generally in

00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,510
three stages within the tasking manager

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,159
first is the project creation then the

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,870
data generation and finally is the

00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,840
quality check which we term as the

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,760
validation and each of this stage is

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,189
handled by mappers with different rules

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,680
based on the project involvement and the

00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:21,500
mapping experience different roles are

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,510
assigned to mappers for example there is

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,389
a project manager who sets up projects

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,590
to address particular information needs

00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,989
and this project could be anything it

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,549
could be to map out buildings that aids

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,769
humanitarians to understand the

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:36,799
population distribution or it could be

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:39,590
to trace roads that help teams to plan

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,239
transport roads and a larger heart

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,180
activation can consist of multiple

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,859
individual projects a mapper in the

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,079
second stage maps from the satellite

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,870
imagery of remote places and in some

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,519
cases regional groups host marathons to

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,739
come together in a more social setting

00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,349
but mostly like people get online lick

00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:59,389
and do the participation remote the

00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:00,889
third States the qualities text age is

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:03,409
handled by a validator

00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:05,739
a validator has to make sure that each

00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:08,090
block each task within the project

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:10,459
fulfills all the mapping goals for the

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,430
instructions and all the data added is

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,989
qualitatively good usually more senior

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,579
mappers get to do the validation but

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,859
based on geography and the nature of the

00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,389
project local mappers could be the

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,729
validators because they have the

00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:24,860
knowledge of the respect area and they

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,770
open the maps by adding more detail

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:31,060
annotations and they also like make

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:35,300
corrections ground-truthing the data

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,830
on the software side we have the

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,990
back-end built with Python flask

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,690
framework the front-end is currently on

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,610
angularjs we are working to ported to

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,640
react will he would be talking about it

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,320
later when he talks about redesign the

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,240
code is free and open-source it's hosted

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,240
on github yeah

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:59,900
thank you room yeah the main and largest

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,900
instance of the tasking manager is the

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,030
hot tasking manager where it includes

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,010
over a hundred organizations and they

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:13,100
have created over six thousand projects

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:16,100
with over 180,000 mappers mapping or

00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:19,280
contributing to an area of 33 million

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,400
square kilometers which corresponds to

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,560
the home of 80 million people the

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,310
generated data has been downloaded by

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:32,990
humanitarian organizations around 34,000

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:34,670
times but the tasking manager is also

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,350
used by many communities around the

00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:40,400
world from Colombia to the Philippines

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,920
in Switzerland in India in projects like

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,130
open historical map and the francophone

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:50,060
Libre all of them and many more are

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,830
using the tasking manager to map for

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:56,090
their own purposes and with their own

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,920
ideas but also professional mapping

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,250
teams rely at large at the tasking

00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,140
manager Apple Microsoft Facebook marks

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,700
our development seeds and many others

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,920
are using the tasking manager for

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,470
coordinating the work of their teams a

00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,720
lot of them have taken the tasking

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,180
manager and extended them and created

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,880
additional functionality on the site and

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,580
over the last year we have been working

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,010
with them on getting their changes into

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,710
the main tasking manager again and it's

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,540
still an ongoing journey but it's great

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:32,420
to see that an open-source community is

00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:34,790
emerging around to software let's go

00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,730
quickly back into the history so the

00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:41,510
idea of the tasking manager was started

00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,880
around 2000 70s 2007 sorry

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,140
and at that time it was more thought as

00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,480
a quality assurance

00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:52,610
tool and had names like quality street

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:56,240
map or osmq a in 2010 the tasking

00:06:52,610 --> 00:07:00,460
manager as it is today it was planned

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,020
and in 2011 the first release happened

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,960
the development at that time had been

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,670
led by Pierre Shiva with hot and

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:14,060
together with a company called Camp to

00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:15,350
camp soon after Pierre voluntary led for

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,320
the development of the tasking manager

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:21,770
and included the start of a new version

00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:25,460
a more stable version to which got

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:28,490
released in 2014 the scope was to review

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,770
the data model do basic things like post

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,110
GIS support and the ability for

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:36,050
translating the UI so we can use it in

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,760
an international context improve the

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,100
workflow and the present performance

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,400
based on the experiences they've had

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,380
from version 1 the version 2 became

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,510
widely used tool and not only within

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:51,110
heart but within there was an

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:54,250
communities to and actually today still

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,950
many instances are running on version 2

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,080
but we are working on it to change that

00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:02,540
the version 3 was a complete rewrite

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,400
with the main focus on improving mapper

00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:09,110
engagement so making communication

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,480
between mappers possible and allowing to

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,510
provide feedback for new osm

00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,340
contributors easing up the validation

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,960
workflow to help identify new

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,730
contributors and give them feedback

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,990
about the review of the contributor data

00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:27,500
and

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,330
it was it was looked at the project

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,280
creation and management workflow that

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,190
hasn't been tagged out so much in the in

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,310
the past in the previous versions and

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:40,000
the infrastructure got re architected to

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:44,000
become scalable and also to allow

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,880
contributions to become easier the

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,680
development for version 3 was led by

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,260
Blake Sheila dot and think we're a

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:56,209
company from Scotland and the version 3

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:58,220
was released two years ago so when we

00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:00,589
wanted to go into the fourth version of

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,779
the tasking manager we clicked off to

00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:05,720
work together with a design studio major

00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,910
from this one and conducted a deeper

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,420
research around to TM user experience

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,640
and we wanted to design a new user

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,320
interface and we looked at the part that

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,390
make it really bit difficult for users

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,200
to continue or to understand what

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,339
they're doing we started performing

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,920
usability analysis where we looked at

00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:27,560
individual pages and flows to understand

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,750
how easy they are to use and if they

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,029
follow best practices and standards and

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,200
if they ultimately help users to achieve

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:38,300
their goals we looked at heuristics like

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,060
the visibility of the system status user

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,560
control and freedom and also the

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,060
aesthetics in order to look for

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,709
improvement points our key findings were

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,709
there's a lack of system feedback and

00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:54,529
error prevention so a lot of time

00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:57,470
actually people don't necessarily know

00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:59,660
why certain things are not working a

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,640
lack of affordance and content overload

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,010
especially in project pages when

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,730
presented to new mappers of obviously

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:10,490
because the tool was built from more

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,740
experienced members and looking at the

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,890
way how new members are using it gave a

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,300
lot of insights in that way and we saw

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,460
that there were actually many buttons

00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,500
competing

00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,720
each other and making it harder for

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:28,370
users to know what actually should click

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:32,630
next so I'm going to hand it over now to

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:35,690
Willie to present concrete results from

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:41,720
our from our study and how the redesign

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:45,620
could look like so in the front-end we

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:48,170
have a new friend framework however our

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,779
goal is not just to make a technical

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:54,649
change our goal is to provide a bad

00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:58,480
experience for the users make it easy

00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:01,160
make the mapping of workflow easy

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,130
whatnot of the things that will not is

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,839
that a beginner map you need a smaller

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:10,220
number of clicks to start mapping and we

00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,529
also are improving the communication

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,640
notification features in order to

00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:18,500
provide more feedback to the users and

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,459
that way you can keep the users more

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:28,580
engaged to map that is part of the new

00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:31,910
homepage the new the new function will

00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,100
be easily custom customizable by all the

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,350
organizations that want choose tasking

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,720
manager just searching some

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,570
configurations and editing I stay of

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,230
file you can change things like the logo

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:47,600
of the organization the colors change

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:51,260
the name URLs of the organization that

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,410
maintains that mistis so it should be

00:11:51,260 --> 00:12:00,620
very easy to draw the parties choose

00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:03,410
task manager we a new design is more

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,829
centered on the user after they use a

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:11,120
he'll do the registration they will be

00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:14,839
directed to a page like that that will

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,020
ask the user for some information we

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:22,380
have that part some terrorist calls that

00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:29,970
the user wants to put reboot

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:32,940
for example environment or refugees we

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,400
have some more settings in that part as

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,350
well and after they use a set some

00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,530
preference they will be directed to a

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:43,980
new page that we used to just some

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:47,580
projects that are related to to the

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:51,120
cause that interests the user so you'll

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:54,510
like don't don't let the user albumin on

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:59,220
the system but have a workflow that he

00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:02,280
can follow to such contributing another

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,530
change that we are making are about the

00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,940
maps we are updating the Maps tools

00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:12,120
vector tiles that is a new technology

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:16,640
which it works faster and we came to of

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:19,830
the the styles of the map as well

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,530
the IgH tour is being integrated in on

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:25,470
task manager that way the user don't

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:29,070
need to like go away from task manager

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:32,310
to another website and so all the way

00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:35,340
map mode flow can be done inside task

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:39,480
manager and after they use that maps and

00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:42,440
saved the change set you can like mark

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,440
the task as done

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:51,660
the API will be updated to have a 2d

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,120
version to know that you provide a

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:58,290
better performance make the pace loader

00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:01,290
faster and make it more easier easier to

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,480
use by other developers now we want to

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,509
highlight some histories about task

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,490
manager the first history is about

00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:13,490
collaboration as felt Felix mission at

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:17,279
the idea behind task manager dates from

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,740
2007 some solutions were proposed with

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,750
different names different approach to

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,259
try to solve that problem of how to

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:28,440
distribute map in effort around an area

00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:29,850
so both the idea in the soft itself was

00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,440
a result of collaboration between

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:37,740
opposites map users so until one year go

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,810
hot didn't have a tag team and most of

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,360
how to's development were done by

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:46,009
volunteers or by contractors or

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:49,110
companies hired by hot so we didn't have

00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:54,029
knowledge about knowledge about task

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:56,819
manager inside hot so Maria Santiago the

00:14:54,029 --> 00:15:00,630
tech team from how to start to be built

00:14:56,819 --> 00:15:03,029
and we have now a staff education

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,430
maintain improved asking managers who

00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:08,670
have now in own knowledge about tasks

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:14,420
managing side heart to lead it to a new

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:16,949
connect level we work with collaboration

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,050
in collaboration with companies and

00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:22,350
organizations that use and collaborate

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:26,160
to task manager development we have a

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:28,980
Buick limiting we're like we discuss the

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,449
future of task manager you can join

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:36,329
those meetings and we invite you to also

00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:38,670
coverage of giving feedback writing code

00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:44,120
testing its documentation which

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:48,050
documentation or translation so now

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,480
women will talk about the second Houston

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,000
so before we get further into the user

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,100
centric design I

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,830
show you how do you use the API

00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,140
documentation to extract individual

00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,610
stats from the tasking manager to know

00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,740
like how much you have contributed to

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,480
the tasking manager say you want to

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,460
learn more about the average mapping

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,040
time for all the contributions that are

00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,890
made on the tasking manager you could

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,560
visit the API documentation site link

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,750
there and you and you'll see like a list

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,350
of operations that let you like talk to

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:23,390
the database and you have to like scroll

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,400
down to the user section select the use

00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,080
of statistics from there you have to

00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,360
click on explicitly trying out the

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,080
option or the operation key in your user

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,490
name and Xu to see the result cure this

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,950
would return like total time you have

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,740
spent on mapping validation and your

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,600
project sum up all the time fields are

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,430
returned in seconds and project counts

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,700
are absolute values now these data

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:48,200
points you reach the average for mapping

00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,210
validation and overall contribution in

00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,070
the tasking manager or otherwise if you

00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,480
have the URL handy you could also append

00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,750
the username directly to the endpoint

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,370
just like how I have mine appended there

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,980
and fetch data for any external use

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,750
cases that you would like to do and this

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,880
is just one endpoint showing your

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,380
individual contributions we also provide

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,780
summary statistics for the global

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,240
instance and project based statistics

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,770
for each of the mapper and all these

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,589
endpoints are also feed into hot oil

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:18,530
sims websites project and country pages

00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:20,630
as part of redesign we'll also add and

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,089
more data points to better understand

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:26,089
the impact each mapper brings into the

00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:30,050
individual mapping projects to felix for

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:32,750
the user centric design so one of the

00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,460
things we realized this oh where have

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,330
all the mappers gone because a lot of

00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,100
them are there but they not necessarily

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:43,220
start mapping so we realized that half

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,530
of them were not doing even one task

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:49,550
after signing up and we wondered why

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:52,070
this is happening and we discovered

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:55,220
several things that made it hard as

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:57,260
really was also explaining jumping out

00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,690
to another editors heart and I'm coming

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,559
back actively so it's not like part of a

00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,950
real user flow

00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:08,760
in this way we you can see in the back

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,740
like the difficulties on that so we

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,990
thought about how we can improve that

00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,120
and the ID integration is definitely one

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,000
of the like big steps that we want to do

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,890
here so people can map within the within

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,090
the tasking manager and then don't have

00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:26,490
to know that they have to go back but

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,640
another thing that I wanted to highlight

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:33,120
here is and I think this is also like

00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,919
one of the interesting results from a

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,880
discussion any hot summits a couple of

00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:41,840
days ago that actually did a simple

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,860
binary yes/no of invalidation and

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,770
validation of saying this is good or

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,570
this is bad might be not not enough and

00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,640
we are more looking into having

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,039
something like coaching so that new

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,350
members have actually more possibilities

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:59,190
of going back and forth with more

00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:02,070
experienced mappers so one of the things

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:04,409
we introduced was at least getting there

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,659
collecting the email addresses so people

00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:09,530
will get notifications and will get

00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:12,690
messages that others are sending to them

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:16,380
and this has been already part of

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,090
version free but almost nobody took

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,010
advantage of it and ninety-eight percent

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,580
of the map of the mappers actually

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,210
didn't

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:26,159
so recently we enforced this so all

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,900
people have to give their email address

00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:29,700
if they want to map on them tasking

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,880
miniature because we see this as a place

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,580
for interaction for becoming better

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,669
mappers and not just a place that it

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:44,280
will where anonymously yes and it all

00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:47,100
happens so so yeah lifting you redesign

00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,900
this user flow will be a little bit more

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,780
seeming less so people will sign up

00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,549
first with their email address and yeah

00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,380
we are constantly improving on maybe

00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:59,850
making sure that people can talk to each

00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:01,559
other the tasking manager is becoming a

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,150
living open-source community and it's

00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,850
really about all of us

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,230
you're welcome to participate and there

00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,090
are many ways of doing so

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,010
testing writing user documentation

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,410
translating is a great support

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:18,669
especially for the new version that is

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:20,710
going to be ready in a few weeks we

00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:22,750
really need your help so please follow

00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,570
the links if you want to help of one of

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:28,150
those tasks and we will let you know

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,309
when we are ready and need your help and

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:33,280
like give some instructions on where to

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:36,370
find and where to find things in the

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,559
feedback and of course developers are

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:42,250
always more than welcome we really want

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,919
your code you can check the source code

00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,540
on github and I encourage everyone which

00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,360
has more interest in the tasking manager

00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:52,270
to attend our working group meetings

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,059
those are bi-weekly Wednesdays on 4:00

00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,940
p.m. UTC and the next one is actually

00:20:55,059 --> 00:21:00,429
happening next Wednesday so with this I

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,890
want to say thanks a lot and open up the

00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:04,059
floor for questions

00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,059
[Music]

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,280
thanks a lot

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,580
wonderful presentation interesting to

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,970
see also to history is very nice to see

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:20,300
ya

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,300
since from the room question over there

00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:42,750
I think here yeah for those of you that

00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:46,980
don't know me I am Pierre Bellon Pearson

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:50,760
I did coordinate most of the major

00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:53,550
disasters since 2012 a lot of experience

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,250
with that tasking manager what I've seen

00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:59,970
over years especially since 2015

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:02,040
a lot of Matata it's a tasking manager

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,890
is very good to escalate to have

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,220
thousands of people's for Nepal we add

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:11,550
eight thousand people in a month and

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:14,460
million of problems building building is

00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:16,860
quite a problem with ID there's a lot of

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,140
problems now you choose to even

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:23,160
integrate it more with the tasking

00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:25,890
manager and other aspect is a lot of

00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,350
groups come you we know the project

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:31,620
manager I'm often project manager for a

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,480
big mission but a lot of small groups

00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,580
organized

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,470
mapathon and they come and they use the

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,980
tasks and we have no way to communicate

00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:43,500
with them it's become a nightmare like

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,600
last year for Boonton Bou it Ebola

00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,500
outbreak it was an emergency

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:54,030
we had to restart job and what we did we

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:57,900
with we we raised the building that were

00:22:54,030 --> 00:23:01,860
added via the buildings were of a lot it

00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:05,340
was over lap over road one way the other

00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:09,030
way so we have to decide to to only use

00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:11,970
the experience matters so very good to

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:16,260
escalate but not enough coordination and

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:20,340
from tools let's say and in the testing

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:23,370
manager thank you thanks for the comment

00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,470
Pierre yeah I think this is a tool and

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:28,830
how it's getting used to pens on how

00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:30,840
yeah what decisions people take what we

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:32,460
can do in a technical side is facilitate

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,040
this communication that you're saying

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,620
that is

00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,740
and that wasn't happen in the past and

00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,750
exactly for this reason we included the

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,070
possibilities for communication and

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,620
making sure that there are email

00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:47,440
addresses making sure that people can be

00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:50,110
contacted and if there are things like

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,630
on editing that are not very well at

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:56,650
least we can like talk to people and try

00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:59,860
to improve the situation thank you

00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:01,450
next question yeah thanks for the

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,930
presentation I'm really looking forward

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:09,070
to the new new task manager Jung from

00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:10,510
MSF we've been in contact already a lot

00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,730
has been said about the validation and

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:15,190
data quality in the past few days also

00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,170
during the hot summit and I'm just

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,840
wondering there are the gamification

00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:21,810
features the user profiles with the

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,670
bread badges and so on but it's mainly

00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:28,780
focused on mappers on those who are

00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:30,730
producing the mapping data but not not

00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,920
on the validators so is there any plan

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:35,530
to motivate the validators to do more

00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,560
and and to give them some kind of

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:40,090
feedback in the new task imager maybe

00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,070
let's just take also just another

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,590
question quickly so they can answer two

00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,330
questions at the same time okay thank

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,790
you for the task manager we just

00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:52,300
deployed the Version three in Croatia

00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:54,430
and is there an easy upgrade from three

00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:59,090
to four or should we kill it and started

00:24:54,430 --> 00:25:02,029
four from scratch thanks a lot

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:04,370
yes about the validators the

00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:08,570
contribution timeline our so considers

00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:12,470
validation and I think the bets come

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:15,559
from the Miss maps but yes we can think

00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:20,749
more ways of engaging all the data's as

00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:23,269
well maybe I can add that one part is

00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:25,850
going to be new in a tasking manager for

00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:28,460
is the possibility to create teams and

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:31,490
those teams can then be added as

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,889
validators to projects so this is not

00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:36,139
like in going towards badges and and

00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:38,539
like reputation but it goes towards like

00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:40,549
actually organizing validators in a

00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:42,619
group and maybe like gift a gift of

00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:45,080
feedback and like the frou-frou a human

00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:47,600
side but we definitely would like to

00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,970
also focus more on how to encourage

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:56,450
validators to do better and to recognize

00:25:49,970 --> 00:26:01,519
their work the question from open

00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:05,240
operations so the upgrade from 3 to 2 to

00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:07,820
4 you will not have any problems if you

00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,769
don't have any extra code so it is in

00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:12,519
the same code base it is within the

00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:15,470
lambic migration so there's like it can

00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:19,759
continuty so it's not like a hard cut as

00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:22,570
it was between 2 and 3 just a question

00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,490
here would it be possible for

00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,320
experienced mappers to get the ability

00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:34,850
to create tasks without going through

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:36,440
the what a mean is uh would it be

00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:38,720
possible for experienced mappers to

00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:44,690
directly join and get the ability to

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:46,639
create asks so what we are having with

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,769
the teams so if if you're an

00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:50,960
organization and there's enough trust on

00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:53,240
a hot Moscone manager then it will be

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,450
easier and for for people to create

00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,159
projects because you don't have need

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,250
like access to everything anymore

00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:04,950
but yeah I think thrust is here the

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,320
important part so at least an hour an

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,120
hour instance we want to collaborate

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,509
with people that don't know what they

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,190
are doing so we do trainings for for

00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:17,370
people that are doing project creation

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,500
and and yeah make sure that this is

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,990
going on well on that side you are

00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:29,340
always free to install your own instance

00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:34,590
where you can do everything time for one

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:38,370
last question now you're all wanting to

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:40,549
have coffee let's go for coffee thanks a

00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,549
