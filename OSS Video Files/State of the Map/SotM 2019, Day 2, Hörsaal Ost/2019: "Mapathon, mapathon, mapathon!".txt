Title: 2019: "Mapathon, mapathon, mapathon!"
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, HÃ¶rsaal Ost
Description: 
	Who benefits from the mapathons: between (over)communication and (over)attribution, critical feedback on the inflation of a form of action oversold in the field of humanitarian action and development aid. Really for the benefit of OSM?

It would be possible to multiply the subtitles for this "Mapathon, mapathon, mapathon!" talk which questions the almost mandatory use taken by this form of collective OSM contribution for humanitarian and development aid stakeholders in the southern territories. "Mapathons in the "south" for what?", "A mapathon does not make a summer", or "Who benefits from mapathons?"... This presentation will aim to open a discussion about the inflation of one specific OSM contribution, to identify the diversity of its practices, the logics of communication, attribution, the quality issues of the data produced, and list the necessary conditions for a mapathon to actually benefit the OSM project in the southern countries and not harming its database. Like in Milano's Bird of Feather sessions last year, this talk will be collectively built with African mappers involved for many years in these activities and ideally co-facilitated by those from Western Africa successful in getting visas and traveling to Heidelberg. This talk is meant to introduce a Bird of Feather session opened to anyone active or interested in this topic and how it impacts the OSM dynamics in the hard environment of the countries of the Global South and especially southern countries of Africa.

good morning good morning welcome at our

00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:23,560
session about mapathon

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:28,120
so we have here with us nikolayeva and

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:30,640
savory Mina welcome they want to bring

00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,739
us a critical view on mapathon Spartans

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:42,489
marathons give them a big applause to

00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:44,920
start today ok thanks very much

00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:48,969
we'll see if you will keep playing at

00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:53,949
the end of the speech hopefully yes so

00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:59,879
the idea that we had by going for this

00:00:53,949 --> 00:01:03,609
magazine a person talk was to to present

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,190
the history of that form of collective

00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:08,350
mapping that that happened in our in

00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,229
OpenStreetMap but we're doing that from

00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:16,570
a perspective which which is us which is

00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:21,750
bit oriented and and so that's not a

00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:24,070
purely neutral way of looking at Madison

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,189
Southern I have been involved in the

00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:30,460
humanitarian OpenStreetMap team and we

00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:32,500
had disagreements on how things have to

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,240
operate which is perfectly healthy and

00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,000
sane in any organization and in

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,479
OpenStreetMap and the way that we are

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
looking at things derived from from that

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:47,950
perspective in terms of outline first we

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,259
some inspire ourselves from talk nur

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:54,189
with this my person my person but the

00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:57,340
idea is to use it as showing what's the

00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:59,590
first form of matter oh it's a it

00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,649
appeared in the OpenStreetMap ecosystem

00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,420
then we so gradually a second form of

00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:07,210
Mikasa which is more or less the one

00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,759
that we're familiar with and hopefully

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,800
we were just going to keep working and

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,330
improving Matheson's and maybe a suit

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,030
for

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,940
is going to emerge which will perhaps

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,430
meet some community requirements with

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,030
respect to the limits that at the moment

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:30,930
we can see in Madison so I'm going to

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:33,540
let self continue the talk now so this

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:41,340
document is public and so we will share

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:44,850
the so history of the mapperton

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,200
phenomenon aside what is what's called

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,700
is - called the mapping parties in

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,090
related to prison space or same

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,640
activities so mapping parties was at the

00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:01,680
very core of the very beginning in in

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:05,450
OpenStreetMap and some generally related

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:11,490
to an activity involving the field

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:17,190
collection regarding mapperton about

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:19,440
historical facts that you actually find

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,180
if you just look on the wiki

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,580
OpenStreetMap about all the past

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:29,250
even's had been made by event organizers

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:34,020
the first day i first mapperton was in

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:36,239
atlanta news 10 years ago and it was so

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,030
I want us to add mapperton

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:43,320
and if you go to the the wiki page you

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:47,760
can see that it's it was over several

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:51,540
days involving local people data

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,590
collection etc and also on a second

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,330
occurrence two years after in India same

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:02,640
thing

00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:05,790
long long duration and after that the

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,940
next occurrence with the disaster

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,340
natural disaster in am Nepal with the

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:16,049
earthquake if you couple of years later

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,630
and with a you my eternal perspective

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:20,430
and then

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,950
a few of the data because it was

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:27,270
involving so much people so many people

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:29,820
and it was a huge outreach for for

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,030
Intuit map and created a lot of data

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:39,030
even if at that time there was already

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:43,620
some data quality issues the the

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:47,310
mapperton multiplicative with now very

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:50,550
short duration events like we couple of

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:59,010
hours three hours typically at the end

00:04:50,550 --> 00:05:02,310
of a working day so now that said let's

00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:07,620
have a look of this mapperton 2.0 I mean

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:12,050
what we have now I mean this is this

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:18,930
scheme of short based mapperton so

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:22,800
basically what it is it's a way to make

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:26,550
to-do information out which kind of demo

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,840
of mapping party time in event and is

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:37,830
generally essentially directive on to

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:40,980
the for for beginners regarding the

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:45,740
mapperton in communication so the

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:48,960
promisor does in for partridge Gmail

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:55,370
involving serve people to January

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:59,100
natural disasters creating data and also

00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,530
often like local community engagement

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,080
Department building especially what it's

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:08,460
related to a connection with local

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:13,770
people joining the map pattern for

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:17,550
example collecting data like in feed

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,800
papers and thing like that regarding the

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:27,710
the material of these of these mapperton

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,710
scheme so you have for example this is

00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,460
documentation about 2 minute tutorial

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:40,590
how you you can aha you can host an Open

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:43,200
Street Map a patent so and it's

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:47,070
basically the communication is anyone

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,840
can organize an a patent and you will be

00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,810
explained how to do it in you will be

00:06:48,840 --> 00:07:05,310
directed to a few resources to organize

00:06:51,810 --> 00:07:09,710
that and I just took a link to some very

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:14,610
recent events that was in May this one

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:18,050
button University of this one was I

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:23,040
think it's even Thursdays

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:25,560
ok so September 24th yeah those two days

00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,230
and you can see that generally the end

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,740
of the day that's three how is long this

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:36,440
one is also three hours long know people

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:43,800
beginners and doing an actual things

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:54,180
events plus data to digitizing over

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:57,480
imagery okay so now like to put this

00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:01,560
this mapperton 2.0 scheming in questions

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:05,210
so I don't know our perspective it's a

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,760
powerful information archery outreach

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,830
events like into a first training a demo

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,900
because it's only three hours for four

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,440
people to be involved in OpenStreetMap

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,740
on that on that front that we can be

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,250
useful as to to put newcomers in

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,530
OpenStreetMap and we know that any

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:29,370
newcomers when you do training you will

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:34,300
have some only 1% of the people that we

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:37,089
really like that impact the thing and

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:40,269
stay and stay active that's not a

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:43,120
problem part but we see the the limits

00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:46,120
we regarding for example the data

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:50,260
quantity I mean the the I mean the but

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,260
the data that it produce really through

00:08:50,260 --> 00:09:00,730
these short-term events is obviously

00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:02,860
limited and of course there's a learning

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:06,310
curve in OpenStreetMap and you cannot be

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:10,779
effective within your first two highways

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:13,300
of mapping that's kind of evidence for

00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:16,720
everyone if you remember you your first

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:21,130
step as a mapper and regarding the data

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:24,519
quality so I just put a few examples old

00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:28,060
ones more recent ones of things that

00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,970
have been done to my patents and think

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:34,709
as the data quality was not good in the

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:39,490
beginning yes for example never been

00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:49,029
corrected I would say by the mappers and

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:51,839
self or the organisers you have some I

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:56,420
mean these mistakes you have FiOS type

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,960
of mistakes recently in a

00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:03,440
discussion list mama make some kind of

00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:08,690
cheap emoji of mistakes he found over

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:14,840
the the areas he monitors and why happy

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:18,250
this this issue because first there is

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,720
actually no prerequisite skills involved

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,760
both of all the participants okay that's

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,890
their beginners but not even for the

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,620
organizers if you go back for example

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:32,290
these two minute tutorials anyone can do

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:36,050
it and the majority for such learning

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:44,150
self training material but actually

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:47,900
anyone can do it and I mean it's it's no

00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:50,870
not unfortunately many of the organizers

00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:57,760
are not skilled enough not even very

00:10:50,870 --> 00:11:00,890
sensitize about the quality aspects and

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,040
generally and even in this community to

00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:06,050
there's absolutely nothing say about you

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,780
should do data cleaning after you

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,780
mapperton that's you you Mapple

00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:16,460
individuals will certainly do mistakes

00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:21,970
and you would need to to clean talents

00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,970
and I mean this sorry

00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:31,990
and this scheme has been one of the two

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:34,579
reasons of the asanas establishing

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:38,449
directing editing guidelines that are

00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:40,759
active from this year the other reasons

00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:43,370
are the companies using OpenStreetMap

00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:49,750
the way they want and not situated with

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:53,839
a community so and I mean for the people

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:59,259
more extreme people involved in the long

00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:02,149
term for in OpenStreetMap in the past we

00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:05,329
some time to tell her to came there's

00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:08,300
kind of the mass like this one that we

00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:10,519
take you really more time to clean that

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:15,439
if you have to start from scratch and

00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:18,110
now a feeling that okay without that we

00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:20,629
have no a second burden that the G the

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,449
thing that could be done in a flexible

00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:26,149
way not having wide lines to do it

00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:31,269
because we we could do the the map you

00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:36,139
know effective way like organizing

00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:39,439
directive in editing without causing and

00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:43,759
harming those and database nerve will

00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:47,899
have that to handle and yes thank you

00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:51,589
for map attuned organizers that just let

00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:59,740
the mess and we know to have to to deal

00:12:51,589 --> 00:13:03,339
with more rules to to to map okay

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:06,110
and so regarding the communication

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:09,649
communities re-engagement the supports

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:13,160
and the building I mean us I mean we

00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:17,350
think it's really about to communicate

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:20,980
did because you you cannot spend

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:24,589
community engagements generally the way

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:26,930
it's it's done if you are just for

00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:29,720
example involving locals doing just a

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:35,780
part of the other marking

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:39,980
workflow what's the benefits of the

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:46,390
scheme for osm outreach yes beginning

00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:46,390
newcomers but not that much actually

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:57,050
generally we ordered the people involved

00:13:52,070 --> 00:14:01,070
as organization or individuals or

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:08,080
individuals cleaning that working on the

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:15,080
the same areas they have to now have a

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:19,070
handle an extra charge of dealing with

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:23,240
the quality and validating all the

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:28,040
details down but for the Newburn ization

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:33,830
involving a patent that's clear that's

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:39,020
really huge communication through this

00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:41,750
map patent okay so we think that it

00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:45,080
really had them to increase their power

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:49,430
and sensuality within all the artists

00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:52,870
poverty CVG i depends on more or less

00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:55,970
the same same thing that voluntary based

00:14:52,870 --> 00:15:00,560
calming communities helping in the you

00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:03,020
might turn field and that's at the

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,430
organization during this matatini to to

00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:10,520
appear as the one creating voluntary

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:13,400
based geodata for big stakeholders and

00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:16,790
funding odds that will give them funds

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:21,620
to continue and order to for for their

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:24,920
other acute activities and also we we

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:28,600
think that this kind of stream

00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:31,250
mentalization of the OSM mappers and

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:36,360
aiming at building for this organization

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:42,400
and centrality for example

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:45,850
every one big that's participate to

00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,890
mapperton to use hot tools etc will be

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:51,910
the volunteer of this organization

00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:55,000
they're hot volunteers the edits

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:58,990
produced by the recent contributors to a

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,870
map patent the tools for example the

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:08,200
tasks the tasking manager the instance

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:10,000
and by H of T becomes their edits trying

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,800
out the edits produced over a year for

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,030
example even if you were just using

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,280
actually the tool without really knowing

00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,860
you want to be to contribute to open

00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,250
street map we're not involved in a in a

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:30,400
project and you didn't know about the

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:33,100
project or other the people behind but

00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,610
you will be inserted what we will do as

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:41,470
a person as a contributor you edits will

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:46,960
be considerate cooperated in the in the

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:50,380
I mean to statistics others also works

00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:59,170
case magazine for disasters green spoons

00:16:50,380 --> 00:17:02,770
is we had bad experience with the

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:09,040
highest signal natural Matthew in in

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:10,960
English michurina in - that's many of

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,960
the marketing organizers of the these

00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:19,300
disasters over the disaster were not

00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:24,340
actually even over the affected areas

00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:27,850
but it was actually mapping projects

00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:32,380
sometimes already existing that would be

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:37,510
useful for certain organization working

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:42,250
on the fields so now what could be

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:44,890
magazine 3.0 maybe we can change fixed

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,850
the semantic that's Martin which is

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:50,139
American cetera

00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:53,049
we don't think it's really fits with

00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:57,409
something that he just tweet how is loan

00:17:53,049 --> 00:18:03,820
first improving that accurate quality

00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:03,820
does some profits from mapperton holders

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:13,399
for example establishing a chief data

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:14,559
officer would be very the solution I

00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:18,610
don't think so

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:21,679
for example Google Maps had some people

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:26,029
caring about quality but the drop google

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:31,070
map maker vetting attacks was helpful

00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:34,759
for the mapperton leaders I don't think

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:36,500
it would be efficient recently my might

00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:41,000
for me was yesterday that they are

00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:44,000
really they're trying to to test the the

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:50,809
AI to connect automatically newbies

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:54,220
errors I think I mean that's we we as

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:58,070
individual we want you to map and

00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:02,090
produce good maps and good data it's not

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:05,509
the process to have someone producing

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:08,000
bad data robot to correct it and us

00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:12,289
explain mappers are validating something

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,740
has been cleaned by a robot we have a

00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:18,490
listen F grout lines now just comply

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:22,220
with that it just required methodology

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:26,990
skills and time I tested that recently

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:30,460
also was in a in Madagascar to really to

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:32,860
test the compliant of these guidelines

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,309
it takes time it takes more time

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:40,700
actually I discovered more thing about

00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:43,639
monitoring data quality but it was three

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:46,909
days of data cleaning process over this

00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:51,350
area to have something cleaned after

00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:53,480
that so just forget I will have to house

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:56,130
my pattern and that that's it

00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,750
no you have to care about the

00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:03,570
the area any text I'm and snot also you

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:07,400
cannot add today you cannot do it just

00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:10,770
to the tasking manager you need all

00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:15,330
other tool like for example as most to

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:16,530
do it communication please stick to the

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,070
variety of the results

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:22,410
it's basically limited to sensitization

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:25,590
to for newcomers of these minima

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:27,840
patterns okay it would be good to job

00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,659
over communication and instrumental

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,960
addition of contributors as I explained

00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:34,760
that

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,590
so the you are de facto volunteer of

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,780
this method in this organization please

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:46,230
drop it that's not a good way of

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:47,640
attributes the the contribution

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,090
basically we are always same

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,510
contributors and something with the

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:58,049
edits bring up or edits when I use a

00:20:54,510 --> 00:21:03,390
tool I'm not I don't want that what has

00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:09,980
produce is supposedly part of what the

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:13,679
the tool holder from the Little Bay

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:15,919
provided by the holder what could be

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,230
done is protein promoting more

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,780
OpenStreetMap in all the communication

00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:24,740
you can see all the links and generally

00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:28,380
opens it map is just a platform

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,950
basically function verbs is above all

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:35,730
the community and there is nothing about

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,559
how to join it and also providing more

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:40,110
the learning curve to provide useful

00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:43,289
contribution it's not something like we

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:45,840
you can learn just by reading some

00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:50,000
documents it takes time for you to learn

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,750
to to produce data and to get something

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,810
this was that's it

00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:58,370
sorry for anything no worries it was

00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:02,870
interesting to hear so it's good that

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:12,710
you finished yeah let's do first a clap

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:15,170
no interesting interesting points you

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:31,700
bring forward do people have questions

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:38,230
for them yeah question over there yeah

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:43,820
it's good um I wanna M if you have any

00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:47,620
know of any studies about the effect of

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:51,130
recruitment of the rapper tones on

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:54,620
getting new mappers involved in osm I

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:56,900
mean we all know that the options that

00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,970
there are some episode coded at these

00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:03,050
events but do you know of any

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:05,900
substantial studies such look at this in

00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:14,960
more depth and provide solid data on

00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:17,930
this I really like someone really good

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,410
at playing with statistic you know with

00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:23,120
our son doing something like a really

00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,520
deep review of what has been done just

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,040
to state that one once for all and I

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,710
would say over the time would be good to

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:33,410
have us also breakdown by kind of

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:36,050
advanced by organizations I mean to give

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:40,220
incentive or feedback forward to them

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:43,520
because yes it's I mean abroad

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,380
I brought feedback that generally we we

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,410
can provide that's really what it will

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:53,510
be very very useful to have such such

00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:55,940
deep analysis of of contribution through

00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,860
my patterns and that's a good thing that

00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,190
we are all stood in act in an academic

00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,260
forum so that's clearly a series of

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,730
topics that would be

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:08,920
very interesting to focus on being very

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:11,740
crises a country specific or than just

00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,500
looking at more general patterns that

00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,660
would really be helpful in terms of

00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,210
framing what's the communication which

00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:22,180
is suitable so that's not to oversell

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:25,060
anything and and stay true to the

00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:31,150
promises of our Simon in that collective

00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:33,070
ways of doing I think I agree with most

00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,990
of everything you presented my only

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,660
complaint is you didn't attribute me on

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:42,610
that mailing list post but you

00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:44,500
attributed other people this is the

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,380
first words I'm saying this morning so

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,420
I'm sorry now I'm saying I think I agree

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,130
with most everything you presented here

00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,260
my only complaint is you didn't

00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:58,570
attribute me on the mailing list post

00:24:53,260 --> 00:25:01,800
you have listed there joking I I think a

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:04,540
lot of it is a communication issue and

00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,030
do you think that it's possible just to

00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,580
iterate on the version number in order

00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:11,380
to present a different concept or do we

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,810
need a new name for what these kinds of

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,360
public engagement activities are should

00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:18,070
we go back to the label mapping party or

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,190
do you have some other ideas for what we

00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:28,600
would call a new and improved events

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:30,340
like these yeah so the attribution was

00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,070
there in the in the in the French

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,650
version and in the translation we forgot

00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:40,480
it so sorry but we shall we shall have

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:43,300
said Nisha so but no yeah really I think

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,720
that one of the of the first points in

00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:49,060
terms of up steps of two steps to your

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,140
attack is to get back to the semantics

00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:56,770
and well reflect on what it usually was

00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,330
what it started to be shall we at the

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,100
beginning when when we were throwing

00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,780
mapping parties we're doing most of

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,820
everything there was sort of end

00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,370
conference around open street map and

00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:10,360
then it had a tendency to focus on on

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,040
field mapping and the map is now is kind

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,730
of a

00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:17,280
an outreach and civilization and then a

00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:20,640
remote mapping party that can focus on

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:24,390
creating data or running data quality

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,730
and I think that what is what is

00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,920
difficult there is that when you use the

00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,740
film APIs and you've got this merit and

00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:35,010
things in mind and the idea that it's

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,490
lasting that it's impactful in terms of

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,280
data

00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:41,280
and basically this is misleading and

00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:44,400
since it's misleading on the short-run

00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,890
that can spark interest from the people

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,080
that are supporting us but then when

00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,510
they will just look at what the

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,780
mapperton in that way it has been sold

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:58,860
that it is really delivering then we can

00:26:54,780 --> 00:27:00,120
face some some possible issues and and

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,840
critics from

00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,610
people that were supporting and and so I

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,240
think that yeah that would be really

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:12,810
cool to to try to relook at our

00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:17,030
practices and find ways to define what

00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:19,890
is a like Alfred a couple of hours

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:22,770
mapping party working remotely on

00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:25,770
something on data creation or data

00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:28,920
quality and what can be something which

00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:31,970
is more important that will last really

00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,910
long and that is meant to to meet

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:40,050
standards in terms of volume of data

00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:43,350
quality of data sort of inch pager of

00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:47,880
skills and and support for four

00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:49,500
capacities locally or remotely and I

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:54,420
think that would be really beneficial

00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:59,480
for all of us shall we do one last short

00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:02,970
question yeah I'll try to be sure my

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,580
name's Dan I should say my name is Dan

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:09,180
I'm involved in the mapping parties in

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:11,390
London I'm interested in this drop the

00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:15,900
volunteers de facto that you're

00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:18,210
suggesting I see in London a lot of

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,350
people coming in because they are

00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:23,930
volunteers

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:27,650
motivated by these organizations so it

00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:35,630
seems quite strange to sort of try and

00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:38,330
exclude that no I think that this is not

00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,910
the idea is not to cut the volunteer

00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:44,090
inside of getting into things the the

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:46,790
idea the the critic is more about the

00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:50,000
way that in communications certain

00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:53,000
organization have a tendency to call

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,290
people that attended those events and

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,120
that use certain tools as a sort of

00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:02,390
volunteers or people from their

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:07,250
communities without any formal agreement

00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:13,310
I think that those organization may try

00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:15,320
to learn from GIS GIS NGOs that have

00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,050
been active in the field like map

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,750
actions or cat omj and they've got a

00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:23,720
status of volunteer whereby you want to

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:26,120
be a volunteer of that entity to act

00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,390
then you've got a process whereby in

00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:33,080
conscious you're cheering as a volunteer

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:36,110
to that group and as a volunteer well

00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,400
you've got certain ways of behaving it

00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:42,350
it really depends on the organization

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,030
and sometimes when you're just there is

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,740
a crisis happening you just want to do

00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,290
mapping you're going to use the tasking

00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,480
manager myself and I'm using that key

00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:54,560
manager and I'm mapping enable hours

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,720
Claire and cap I in I'm not creating

00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,270
data for the humanitarian OpenStreetMap

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:03,950
team organization I'm part of an

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:07,700
OpenStreetMap response and then I'm

00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:10,310
using that platform and I may be quoted

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:13,190
as a volunteer or as a member of that

00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:15,260
community when I was acting in a very

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,060
specific way I mean this is the this is

00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,940
the point that we were making but not

00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:22,040
cutting the volunteering and we are

00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:25,160
treasuring the fact that there is an

00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:29,629
interest and a motivation to bring to

00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:32,749
OpenStreetMap people rely based on the

00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:36,340
the needs the network which is done by

00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:39,049
those organization as we said we said a

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:42,590
mapperton the waiter has been promoted

00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:46,879
and the way that it it solidify is a

00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:49,129
very powerful outreach and enforce and

00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:51,919
civilization D module that's something

00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:53,690
which is very very good and we shall

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:58,460
leverage on that and basically that's

00:30:53,690 --> 00:31:01,639
the whole set of framing the the the the

00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:04,820
the text the the semantics and and

00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:07,849
trying to stick to true communications

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:10,249
if ever possible would be a good way for

00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:13,700
OpenStreetMap and those groups just to

00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:18,889
to fully capture the potential of

00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:21,639
Maupassant okay thanks a lot last big

00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:21,639
