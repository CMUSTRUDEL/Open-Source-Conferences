Title: 2019: Mapper's privacy
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, HÃ¶rsaal Ost
Description: 
	OpenStreetMap's processes are carefully designed to minimize the privacy footprint of the mappers.
Nonetheless, the principle that any edit shall be attributable means that some data is still recorded.
An overview is given which data is recorded at all and which of it gets available to whom.

OpenStreetMap surveys data about places, not about persons. Thus privacy sensitive data in the geodata is very rare and always unwanted. Likewise, the principle of distributing the data allows data consumers of the geodata to stay as anonymous as they want. Mappers can contribute with pseudonyms, although not completely anonymous.

However, for both the social features of OpenStreetMap and the purpose of attribution for the edited data it is necessary to collect some privacy related data. A useful starting point to see your own data footprint is the tool HDYC.

All the edits you make are grouped into changesets, and the editing software will urge you to add a comment per changeset. As both the edits and the changesets carry dates it is possible to track your activity times. The nature of some edits may suggest local knowledge thus that you actually have been at the mapped places. The kind of edited objects and the mapping standards can be checked by every other contributor as well. Most often, this is simply a reason to be proud of the achievements, but you should know and check before it might get a matter of concern. Using separated accounts for different mapping tasks is often an appropriate solution and well-accepted in the community.

OpenStreetMap offers additional ways to interact: you can leave comments on changesets and notes on the map, you can discuss on mailing lists or the forum, or you can answer questions on help.
You can write documentation on the wiki. All of these channels have their own rules with regard to how long the data is stored, how it is searchable, and whether you can hide or delete your contributions.

The talk presents the data traces of each channel and discusses strategies to get the desired degree of privacy.

	00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,740
so yeah we're gonna hand over now to

00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,760
rollin to talk about Muppet privacy

00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,550
Thanks yep

00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,220
thank you for the introduction and thank

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,610
you for the thank you for coming here to

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:26,810
the talk and I'm talking about Methos

00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:28,939
privacy this is not about the gdpr

00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:33,050
because this would easily fill an entire

00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:35,690
talk on even less about current law in

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,260
general there are still some GDP our

00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:43,790
work by the OMF under way you will see

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,860
things changing in the upcoming years I

00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:49,519
will be honest in the upcoming years it

00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:52,670
has been two years ago that gdpr got

00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:58,820
effective and there's not happened that

00:00:52,670 --> 00:01:01,720
much sin in this time then this work

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:09,140
would mostly increase privacy and

00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:10,700
matters continue to and members continue

00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,860
to get information about other methods

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,799
but usually what will happen from the

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,440
awesome eff side is such functions now

00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,140
known that somehow are about Memphis

00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,290
data will get behind a bar that you need

00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,010
to lock in my document here's the actual

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,780
information flow and one important thing

00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,620
to keep in mind of them Street Map

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,760
relies on accountability as in science

00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:38,450
accountability has to be pride of the

00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,240
own at the on things one has done and

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,670
not about accountability as in crime or

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:48,100
liability while you try to avoid to

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:52,340
being being accountable for something

00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,480
there's made in particular there's not

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,460
that much

00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,080
checking necessary than in the other way

00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,850
around because are no drastic

00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,340
consequences if you are just hold

00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,340
accountable first thing you have done

00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:10,159
the hope is of this talk is that you

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,659
learn to get super data in avid

00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:19,040
inevitably gets at at and get the right

00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:21,200
idea what happens to it I will start

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,060
with one extreme case to get everybody

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:31,209
awake just please read this text

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:33,459
I hope it's big enough okay I'll just

00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:35,410
read out in response receiving a

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:37,420
short-term account Bend from one of the

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,600
members of the or data working group you

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,700
have contacted their employer and

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,670
complained about supposedly illegal

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,200
activity on their part you have crossed

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,819
the line by attempting person to

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,560
personally intimidate those who

00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:58,000
volunteer at the time for awesome F this

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,739
is totally unacceptable and what has

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,790
happened here is one extreme case I

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:07,060
never have heard about this but 99% of

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,250
all NFS are of Cottam of course harmless

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,019
but in this case is turned out to be

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:16,870
somebody who has already been convicted

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:21,100
about stalking and were attacked one one

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:23,080
of the data working group members trying

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:29,049
to do his proper work and to sort out

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:31,420
wonder lism this stalker has done and so

00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:36,670
this to see why there is some manner in

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:38,860
having the in getting privacy right we

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,630
all trust all today and we can trust

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,440
that most of our fellow members are

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:47,590
somewhere in the range of normal behaved

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,489
but just in case of a thing like this or

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,290
in case your government gets totally get

00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:57,010
totally bad it's also not completely

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:59,739
impossible it's always better if you're

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,239
if they just can't do this thing because

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,470
they don't have the data to do it

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:07,989
and for that for this reason I would

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:11,410
generally strongly come strongly suggest

00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:13,720
to use pseudonyms which means it should

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,090
be impossible to get from yours and data

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,320
to your private phone number or your

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:22,960
privates postal address email address

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,669
the depend a little bit of you

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,770
ultimately from your email address can

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,800
be kept

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:34,370
- a postal address and so on it's

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,389
probably a bad idea anyway it's just

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,270
that's a little bit of clash between

00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,610
this pride I've mentioned before and on

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,349
the other and this one it's just to

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:48,409
mention it's not totally pointless it's

00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:52,699
not just fulfilling fancy legislation

00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:52,699
there's really some background to this

00:04:52,729 --> 00:05:00,419
so the general or some F policy on this

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:02,550
is I'm not not part of support and even

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,490
know bought member could just speak for

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,740
this this is not officially announced

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,169
policy but the general policy to to give

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,330
you an idea is you need to be a meta to

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:14,789
see the data of other mappers this was

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,610
the basic idea about how all the

00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:22,080
functions after the work should look

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:26,879
like the important thing is here this

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:31,560
deter blatant abuses of the data just if

00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:33,870
a company is going to just cover tree

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:39,810
copy all of the data they know that they

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:41,430
are doing something unlawful but on the

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,349
other end you have just seen that the

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,180
stalker in question would easily would

00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:49,620
have still have got all the Memphis data

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:52,110
so this is not going to to be the magic

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,819
Silver Bullet that makes every data safe

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:59,460
so that we have a walled garden where

00:05:53,819 --> 00:06:00,900
everything is safe inside we do never we

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,710
do not want to make this promise we

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:08,819
cannot make this promise to be honest so

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:11,310
yes this is a policy that solves most of

00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:14,490
the problems but still you should at any

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:19,370
point understand how your data this data

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:22,319
you - that you add is going to last a

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,810
very good site to get this about the

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,060
general mapping activity is how did you

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:33,569
contribute from husqvarna's who in the

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:38,130
room can know that or okay I encourage

00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:42,900
everyone else to Google for

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:45,920
HDA why is he and osm or Pascal knives

00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,330
if this is easier to remember for you

00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,210
the idea of this tool is you have to

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:54,060
login as an awesome user to get to

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,060
credit use this is in accordance with

00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,060
was a policy mentioned before and then

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,180
you can ask the information about any

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:07,590
other mapa what I have done is I have

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,600
two accounts one for my activity private

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,500
activity and the other father for my

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,710
working activity and I have just used

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,900
all the data from my working activity or

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,410
loss just watched all the data of my

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:26,240
working activity from my private account

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,240
so from the system's point of view it's

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:33,780
it's one meta about a fellow meta but in

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,590
fact it's me about me so I'm I can't

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:42,210
present this data without without

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:44,360
hurting anybody's privacy so there's a

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,830
very good tool to see what's possible

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,750
what's what's the baseline possibilities

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,710
are about what happens to your mapping

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:55,440
data and I'll come back to this in a

00:07:52,710 --> 00:08:01,010
moment you'll just sift through this

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,010
part and then get to additional channels

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,390
one thing you could do is the

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:09,120
classification of edits this is for

00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:11,700
example not directly in how did you

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,590
contribute inside but you can do it with

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,620
the overpass API and there are some

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:19,350
other tools too and what I have what

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:24,690
have I done here well I have create

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:29,630
through which keys are often a key learn

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:36,510
how many objects carry a key was this

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:40,110
value in the object that the user dr r

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:44,130
BR underscore m DB that's my workplace

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:47,280
user username has touched so I see

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,930
karate three clearly there are 949

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,820
objects

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:57,220
with carrying a key railways that have

00:08:51,820 --> 00:09:00,520
touched there are many other objects or

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,790
the objects that are on the top of the

00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:07,420
list are are about railways

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:09,370
so obviously the my workplace account is

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:14,020
mostly busy was doing reveille mapping

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:16,840
and you could also see that I'm not

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,490
doing much about about wheelchairs

00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:23,020
because it's the first place where I run

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:26,590
tech related to this appears and you

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,360
could kiss get this more fine but

00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,010
obviously about if you're thinking a

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,950
couple of minutes about it would be even

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,920
more interesting to get it more cause to

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:38,810
get to define for yourself categories of

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,740
what you were interested in and then

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,970
[Music]

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:47,470
then put together a group together

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:51,490
several tags to to see really just parse

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:53,080
how our intensities how how much as a

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:59,170
certain leper is interested in one

00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:02,380
subject and this is possible it's also

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:05,530
done by by how did you contribute in a

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:08,740
slightly different setting and they look

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:13,030
into change sets and they make a Beck

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,590
resource meant of the of the objects

00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,320
that are touched in the change fit and

00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,930
look in which presets in which docent

00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,770
presets the tags of these objects are

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:26,610
described this looks like this and it's

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,860
only done for the signal to change set

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:32,470
but this is just an example to see what

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,330
you what about your user data could be

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,760
made you could really you could even

00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,290
combine this was things seen before and

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:43,240
you could seem how your interests have

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:46,600
to have devolved and whether you had

00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,070
involved various presets just in the

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,020
first three years and then the

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,420
diminished or was they have been super

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:57,190
present all over the time or was our

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:59,140
wheelchair presets just have popped up

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,600
in the last year and so I couldn't

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:05,790
credibly claim that I have been in one

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:10,540
was wheelchair taking much longer Anton

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:12,910
but happily enough there's no there's no

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,410
tool so far ready to do this and at the

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,519
moment due to the structure of the

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:21,279
database it would require to to process

00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,110
the full history planet um and that's

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,240
quite a big of things so I don't think

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,339
it's happened to happen yet but it's you

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,759
should keep in mind it would be possible

00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:32,709
at any moment for any other mapper to

00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:35,709
get in detailed idea what you are

00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:38,920
interested in on subjects what

00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:46,540
concerning your mapping and also where

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:52,149
are about your areas of interest and

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:55,180
indeed a similar as the thing that did

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:58,269
create some up rear there are two

00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,670
sections in how did you contribute that

00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:04,690
you created where people were surprised

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:07,209
from one is that you could figure out

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:11,199
this is a style that you also find in

00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:14,230
github so if you're doing commits a bit

00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:16,240
if you work with github to and similar

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,540
statistic about you will be available as

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:24,930
well this unfortunately it's difficult

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:27,670
to reach on the on the large screen it

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:30,069
essentially it offers a whole calendar

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,899
of the year and it marks all the days

00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:34,060
where you actually have done some things

00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:36,850
so people could exactly see and see at

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:41,350
which days of the year you have to sum

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:44,259
or much extent being active and this one

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,240
would usually set out quite clear

00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:48,699
whether you're mapping from the office

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,949
or whether you're mapping from home

00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:54,639
because in this case it's it's pretty

00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:56,350
obvious if most of the mapping happens

00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,480
from Monday to Friday then it's

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,480
obviously happening in the in the office

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,750
so yes if somebody wants he could figure

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:10,689
out about another meta one the Met

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,050
parasite if what the mapper is doing and

00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:14,000
also if it's

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,100
interest shifts with the day of the week

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,240
with the day of the week and so on it

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:23,420
would be always possible to combine it's

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,610
just luckily we don't know of any cases

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,260
where people are doing this but you

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:32,450
should be prepared the data would be

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:37,240
ready to do so and this goes back to

00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:40,579
like the other data - about - about 2009

00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,950
when change sets were introduced so you

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:45,820
could check back you are back to 2009

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:49,250
when what your interests were or

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,959
probably in most cases including me back

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:55,459
to the point we are joined to project

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:57,200
what I have done another thing our

00:13:55,459 --> 00:14:01,070
change its common its change that

00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,750
comments the feature in itself turned

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,269
out to be extremely useful they have

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:09,050
been introduced relatively late into

00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:13,550
OpenStreetMap and that year is instead

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:17,450
of escalating a discussion always into

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:21,560
the entire wide community - to pinpoint

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:24,350
the change that is causing the problems

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,320
and to attach the discuss a discussion

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,390
to that same set and that way you could

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,190
see how controversial the idiots of a

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:36,589
similar matter are this is the only Beck

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,910
possible to 2015 but mostly because the

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,589
feature hasn't been implemented before

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,920
so nobody has been able to write

00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:45,589
comments before there are also no

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,579
indications that are people are wanting

00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:51,709
to cut off the strangest comments later

00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:57,350
and time to to limit the amount of time

00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:59,720
that you could look back for a pass so

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,810
you could make even seen that this

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,320
morning about anonymized in Peter Mooney

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,910
stocks that could make social graphs our

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,019
Memphis interact whether there are

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:16,370
cliques that are working together or was

00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:18,769
a release enemy lines fighting each

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,770
other you could all get out all of the

00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:23,120
the comment list because it's already -

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:27,080
to read from the main a

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,150
yeah this is opposed to mailing lists

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,270
and in fact all the other communication

00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:35,240
channels there's an example for the tech

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:38,540
for the talk archives you could download

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,640
the entire did the entire set of mails

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,540
it ever has a chance it of posts that

00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:48,230
ever has been written to talk it's here

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,900
it's in this gzip tax or you could

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,200
viewer stand on the web here and it's

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:57,500
also it's going back to 2000 I think

00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:01,160
2004 even so it's also when you write

00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:04,220
something to to awesome talk it's also

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,510
its public or its project public you

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,110
know this case it's even completely

00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:11,779
public forever it's completely part of a

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:16,250
public forever in this case because the

00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:18,500
account system here is independent of

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:24,170
the account system of the awesome user

00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:26,390
base part similar for the wiki we have

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:32,600
two functions here to even facilitate

00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:35,410
sorting you could either track who has

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,850
contributed to a page or you could track

00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,279
which contributes and somebody has made

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:44,420
you can also get back the entire history

00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:50,990
of of a single contributor back to 2005

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:54,080
and it's somewhat mitigated but I think

00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:57,680
it's more accidentally than entry then

00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,650
on purpose by that you cannot just get

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,660
the dump of the wiki at the moment I

00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:06,319
think it's mostly a technical constraint

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,179
and not not intended so yes it's ready

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,360
to click you can check it for any other

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:13,189
matter and yourself of course - but it's

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,550
not machine readable so it cannot be

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,770
matched up with the other data and its

00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,949
are still separate accounts that's

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:24,530
different for the forum we have exact

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,780
mucha lines up with your awesome user

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:29,540
account and it's searchable in the same

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,790
way search for the author search for a

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,290
certain

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:37,870
list of posts all the people that have

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:40,510
contributed and doing this forever for

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,970
the lifetime and for her bottom street

00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:46,870
map which is also based in all same user

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:48,880
accounts and so there are some other

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,370
other systems that I have intentionally

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,510
skipped hoping to talk about the most

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:58,570
important to give you a summary there's

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:01,240
a huge block of metadata of mapping

00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:06,040
together with changing data a huge block

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:12,390
of metadata on top of CEOs M database

00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:15,400
that allowed to do a lot of a lot of

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:20,500
extra analysis and a lot of extra

00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:22,810
intelligence on the Napa's network it's

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,200
by gdpr it's technically or restricted

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:28,720
to to only purposes for the good of the

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,190
project but it's basically it at the

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,440
moment it's accessible to the entire

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:37,390
world and the intent is to restrict it

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:43,390
to mappers but this doesn't mean it gets

00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:44,950
invisible and the second large block are

00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,920
the communication channels which are

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,600
each separated and do not allow to to

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:55,030
interchange information directly between

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:57,490
it so they are in that sense a little

00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,270
bit harmless but if I want to make a

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:02,440
suggestion

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:05,080
I generally encourage you to to use

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,180
pseudonyms to avoid that you can from

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,250
your username from yours I'm username

00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:14,290
check back your personal address and

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:17,380
phone number because it's for the

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:19,390
project like mentioned the whole thing

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,850
is pyar based and pride so you really do

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,680
want to want to have user names that can

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:31,860
build up reputation so it's never going

00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:34,450
to vanish beside project inertia and and

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,540
for the other communication channels to

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:43,020
just keep in mind that everything you

00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:43,020
write is essentially stored forever and

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:49,350
the best solution the solution that I

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:51,000
apply that actually had improved all my

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:55,670
contributions through the communications

00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:00,270
in March is I reread my messages before

00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:02,220
before I sent them and usually I keep

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,670
them if stuff if I find traces of

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:09,150
emotions in the replies I keep them back

00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:11,660
for some hours up to 24 hours so you

00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:14,040
often will see that I will answer

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,200
relatively late to a discussion but

00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,150
that's on purpose because I want to cool

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,240
down the discussions usually if you have

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:25,260
facts it's no problem to two and a half

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,990
a day later or so but much of the things

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,620
you the afterwards don't want to have in

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:34,110
the net about you happen because you

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,500
your answer in five minutes so the

00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:42,600
general suggestion here is just we read

00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:46,110
your messages when consider sending it

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:49,290
later to much later with the order of

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:52,380
magnitude of 24 hours so thank you for

00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:55,160
your attention and I hope you have feel

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,150
free to ask questions now

00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,309
[Applause]

00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,309
[Music]

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,840
hey thank you so much so we have about

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,670
seven minutes for questions so I'm gonna

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,010
run a mic on this side and who she is

00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:15,120
gonna run a mic on this side so hands up

00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,120
over here first okay

00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:23,460
thank you basically is a privacy

00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:26,710
protection that only mappers can see is

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,590
well seriously taken it's pretty kind of

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:33,310
soft or or fake so it does not protect

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:35,440
any privacy in reality so insistence in

00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,570
better sooner than later but we'll

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,440
definitely need something better I don't

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:45,370
know maybe mandatory one-off usernames

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:50,170
or not storing usernames at all could be

00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:51,820
a solutions are so probably this is very

00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,960
difficult to implement to make it

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,610
securely but just wanted to note that

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,440
this kind of longer-term privacy

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:02,770
protection solution is definitely needed

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,930
which is really kind of hiding and does

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,990
not collect the data what is can be

00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:10,360
later used for years thank you for the

00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:15,130
remark but as I have mentioned there's a

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:17,770
lot of a lot of osm is based on user

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,080
name reputation or I would to make very

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:25,440
clear I prefer to speak about user name

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:28,900
pride so I don't see any any approach to

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,970
to keep people from from building up a

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,420
reputation and using user names of a

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:44,170
long time it's just because it's so

00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:46,330
essential for the project there are pros

00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:48,640
and cons and the challenges are but in a

00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:51,160
longer term people maybe see after 10

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,400
years that they should have been more

00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,770
careful so we will need to step like one

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,840
step ahead and makes his private

00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,810
settings as default ones and if somebody

00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,240
really knows what he does and takes

00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:06,100
extra steps then he can link different

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,200
edits to one username until the

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,050
reputation and these kind of things so I

00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,150
think nowadays we should kind of look

00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,160
other way use private settings as

00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:16,890
defaults makes it as easy as possible

00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,290
and if really somebody wants to destroy

00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,070
their privacy then make it possible okay

00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,830
thank you

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:26,280
can't the need to login to see other

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:29,280
users data be circumvented by using the

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:34,050
show data and then history on the slippy

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:37,200
map sorry that you can circumvent the

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:39,000
privacy all that point clumsily by going

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,820
on to the slippy map putting the data

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,890
layer in and then asking for the history

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,050
of something it would be quite hard to

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:50,250
stalk somebody with that but I would

00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:59,820
like to suggest you'd read for hours

00:23:50,250 --> 00:24:02,220
sorry I'd like to suggest you to reach

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,250
the full hours and F concept it's a

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:11,190
month the functions that would be hidden

00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:13,470
behind the login requirement it just it

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,420
the long list we have essentially three

00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,990
different types and I don't have to all

00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:22,560
in mind one is nothing needs to be

00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:24,570
changed one is the call in itself will

00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,450
still have a useful result but the

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,460
result is somehow altered for example if

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,290
you ask for an original object you will

00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,770
see the object but the username and

00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:37,230
change that will be dropped from this

00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:39,390
and thumb are just you don't you can't

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:44,550
present meaningful data and for that

00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:46,800
reason the you won't see and you want

00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:53,130
because it won't be possible to to make

00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:55,920
that car without being locked in to what

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:58,350
extent do you think that creating a

00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,940
community of human beings who

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,680
communicate with each other is actually

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,250
in tension with the idea of having

00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,250
privacy

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,250
excuse me please I have understood the

00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,679
conflict between building a community

00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,240
and privacy but has there been more on

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,000
the question of just misses so I'm sorry

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,790
for this no no I was just wondering if

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,679
if everybody takes all steps necessary

00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,970
to protect their privacy mmm

00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,820
how much do you think that gets in the

00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,830
way of events like these for example you

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,929
know people are here we are not in

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,690
wearing balaclavas we're not protecting

00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,940
our privacy to the utmost extent so

00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:41,160
clearly human beings prefer to interact

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:43,080
with each other well there are many

00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,770
shades of grey and they are even colors

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:52,410
to make the work more more beautiful so

00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:54,870
I think I'm not going to give you my my

00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:57,570
full detail map for private details

00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:00,510
I'm not wearing a t-shirt with my postal

00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:03,750
address and even the less my medical

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:07,980
data so you can get to a conference and

00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:14,429
present a certain role and this case

00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:19,320
roughly gets my name image and and my

00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:21,210
username and similarly when was in a

00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,730
project like of street map there will be

00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:26,340
in the long term after the work is

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:28,710
through was an F I'm sure there can and

00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:35,910
should be discussions how we could

00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:38,610
balance between privacy and and building

00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:42,929
a community for example one thing I

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:45,059
would would suggest this way would put

00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:47,010
going through an idea of one-off

00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:49,170
usernames but without making the

00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,600
mandatory if we facilitate to have

00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:54,210
multiple accounts shut that such that

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,300
people are used to have on average

00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,970
thousand accounts or so and everybody

00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:05,370
else only sees basically unconnected

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:06,420
accounts but yeah later point in time if

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,930
you're

00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:12,300
consider it useful you can tell people

00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:15,810
that you own several of these accounts

00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,640
it would be able to sort out different

00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:21,210
mapping activities for example by region

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:24,360
also us also this might make more

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:26,730
privacy without messing in with a

00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,800
commuter with a community aspect but

00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:34,280
it's a difficult thing you have to to

00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:38,700
fine tune a lot of a lot of screws and

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:40,920
probably we have to find a way out and

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,200
as we are still building was the basic

00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,610
work at the moment and don't think this

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,610
