	00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,799
so if we have quite a a varied schedule

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,120
for the next 20 minutes but we're

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,750
kicking off

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:23,340
with Steven talking about open Street

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:27,119
browser Thanks hi I'm Stefan from Vienna

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:31,200
Austria I'm involved if the

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:37,739
OpenStreetMap for about 11 years or so

00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:39,780
after Padma first GPS receiver and soon

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,899
after I started playing with the data

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:47,670
and what came out was the open Street

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:52,980
browser which has its the other fourth

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:55,769
iteration now I just want to show you of

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,350
what you can do with it so you get a

00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:03,030
normal map view and on the left you have

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:06,630
these categories for example you get

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:13,790
everything which has which is gastronomy

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:18,630
like restaurants bars fast-food cafes

00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:21,299
whatever and so it was a bit faster

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,469
because I pre cached the data so we

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,810
don't have to wait for the data and yeah

00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:32,100
you can click there and then you see the

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,439
camps it has we don't know what kind of

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:44,820
cuisine test it has an address has a

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:49,289
website opening hours and stuff here and

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,530
there like variety of categories the

00:01:49,289 --> 00:02:00,380
shopping craft leisure children

00:01:52,530 --> 00:02:04,799
amenities like playgrounds toy shops and

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:08,670
restaurants which have a toilet with a

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:14,430
diaper changing table and all things

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:17,490
that's useful I want to show you some

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:21,650
special integration which the open

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,270
Street browser has this is in culture

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,130
objects

00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:32,690
have some Wikipedia article II will get

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:36,800
an image Wikipedia big data Wikimedia

00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:42,880
Commons image maybe you know the several

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:50,800
ways to tag objects from the wikimedia

00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:50,800
group so yeah it's just a wikipedia tag

00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:03,050
different example is here there's the s

00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:06,320
printing horse and as you can see it has

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:08,720
a wicked theta maybe I guess you are not

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:14,540
aware with wicked date because I also

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:17,560
just found out about it recently wiki

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:22,580
data is a platform which connects

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:29,390
different several Wikipedia and

00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:30,410
Wikimedia Commons projects you can go to

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,610
wicked data

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:42,200
org and when I choose this ID which is

00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:46,340
some it's Q and some number difficulty

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:50,030
then it shows me the image a location

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,160
and the commons category and so this is

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,570
a data which is passed by open street

00:03:52,160 --> 00:04:04,310
browser to give you this slideshow here

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:08,060
yeah what you also can do is you can

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,240
filter in the categories for special

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:15,880
types like only interested in fountain

00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,880
so I'm only interested in galleries and

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:30,060
other things that are interesting this

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:33,500
is the max speed map of this region so

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:43,350
you see the green lines of 30 kilometers

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:48,780
orange 50 and it even understands the

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:53,030
mph if it's text correctly so it's

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:56,340
really cool what I am recently

00:04:53,030 --> 00:05:00,360
interested in is the start date of

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:03,390
buildings and other objects you see the

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,320
gray buildings don't have a start date

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:10,940
set so most of them they're just a few

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:16,100
here's a synagogue which was built in

00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:21,590
1994 and there's an older Church

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:26,130
apparently it was built in 17-7 team

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:31,400
yeah so there are some cities around the

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:35,700
world which are colored very bright

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:38,850
because so many buildings are mapped

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:42,150
with the start state but this is quite

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,970
some work to do so if you're looking for

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:49,620
something which you want to map you can

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:54,800
Viki data tags upload images of artwork

00:05:49,620 --> 00:06:01,280
and buildings and memorial plates and

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,280
map start state you still have a minute

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,190
yes so if you are really interested in

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,050
the open suite browser

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:15,140
you could even design your own

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,140
categories that is websites

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,200
ww of a 3-part work slash def where you

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,950
can adjust it looks a little bit like

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:29,330
github it's it's keep teeth some it's a

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:32,220
clone of kids are basically and it's

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:36,830
where you can create

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:39,270
is chasing files which have category

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:50,940
definition for example this would be the

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:51,180
children can get a bit I think I broke

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:57,170
it

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:59,850
oh that's good that's good so it's a

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:03,570
category these are the key areas which

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:06,000
it uses like notes ways and relations

00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:12,360
like a playground summer camp in the

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,630
play a few shops toilets with tire / and

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:20,250
kids areas and there's a description

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:23,900
which so depending on the type of object

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:29,100
it will choose the correct translation

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:33,530
markers and a met key even the filters

00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:38,960
are mapped here and which is if you

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:48,930
click on edit you would even get some

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:53,390
it's not so useable in that size some UI

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:56,190
where you can which helps creates these

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,500
categories so but if you are really

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,710
interested then please come to me after

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:05,870
the talk and I can show you how it is

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,870
being done yes

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,620

the end so next we have Arianna talking

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,360

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,360

convert as many GIS people traditional

00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:59,069
GIS people into open GIS and we're also

00:10:55,509 --> 00:11:05,040
bringing computer science students and

00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:05,040
some osm mappers that are in the region

00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:13,990

have transport I've never known that

00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:01,209
before in an event so next we're gonna

00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:03,779
have planning urban accessibility with

00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:03,779
OSM

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:34,970
okay hi everyone

00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:38,180
Alessandra Sarita and talking short talk

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:40,130
about how we used OpenStreetMap for

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,450
planning urban accessibility for

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:46,880
disabled people in the city of Padua who

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:49,130
founded this project together with the

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:54,200
patronage of the Wikimedia Italian and

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:56,720
the the topic was the called pepper is a

00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,380
plan for elimination of architectural

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,450
barriers and it's a legislative tool so

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,720
it's not only a project so that the

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:09,590
output is a administrative allegedly

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,200
legislation a grounding one the aim was

00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:16,820
to ensure for full accessibility of

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:20,420
urban path spaces and buildings for all

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,940
the people and it had a wide

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:28,480
participatory vision in the sense that

00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:31,670
we organized 10 meetings for citizens to

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,780
select the areas where to map

00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:41,589
accessibility elements and 10 mapping

00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:44,450
events to collect information we

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:47,030
OpenStreetMap has been selected has been

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:50,030
chosen as the core tool for map in

00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,980
accessibility elements is not used the

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:55,550
fora for background but from the

00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,110
beginning we chose to go directly on up

00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,810
the street map from the beginning to the

00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:04,130
end of the process using open geospatial

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:10,910
tools for analyzing data and inputting

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:15,110
data starting from ground images through

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:18,490
mapillary using field papers and ottoman

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:22,100
app for collecting information and

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:24,420
johnson for editing and OpenStreetMap

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,029
plus QJ yes for

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,720
using the final cuts of graphic outputs

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:32,880
of the of the project this slide is just

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,160
to tell you that usually or a more

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:40,399
commonly the approach to accessibility

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:43,199
in OpenStreetMap is about information on

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,529
buildings or shops whether they are

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:50,130
accessible to wheelchair system is quite

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:52,440
simple as which is no limited class you

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:56,389
can add information some information on

00:15:52,440 --> 00:16:00,870
steps or bathrooms but it's mainly

00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:07,260
focused on places where you can enter or

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:10,880
not we needed to go not specific on that

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:14,670
but on foot way paths crossings

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,649
sidewalks so the tagging systems is not

00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:21,269
so simple and we want it to be more as

00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:23,940
as quantitative as possible not using we

00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:27,990
haven't really used the wheelchair tag

00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:30,029
but try to focus on the tag scheme

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:33,570
considering all the elements of a

00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:36,060
sidewalk of a crossing or and you see

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:40,829
here a table with some of the elements

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:43,589
and how we interpreted them as useful

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:46,980
for accessibility purposes so smoothness

00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:50,820
with inclined height for the foot base

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,380
and paths for the curbs the height of

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,920
the curbs whether or not there is a

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:59,339
tactile paving or for the traffic

00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,980
signals if there is a sound signal

00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:05,839
available or whether there are obstacles

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:10,319
in the in the sidewalk that to be

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:12,449
described and and included as an

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,919
information for accessibility of the

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:19,439
path and the final out in maps is

00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:23,459
something with that where we we have the

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:28,079
path crossings the curbs obstacles with

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:34,049
a degree of accessibility made directly

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:36,419
from selecting that quality qualitative

00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,840
quantitative information from the upper

00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:41,770
treatment database

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:46,330
and represented this is one of the part

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:49,929
of the of the maps in the in the plan of

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:54,520
the of the city so it's OpenStreetMap at

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:56,770
all and some numbers we use the we

00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,720
collected more than 10,000 images in the

00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:02,760
pillory it's 40 kilometers of the food

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:06,100
trade paths mapped people involved

00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:10,809
specific elements mapped just to give

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:12,669
you a rough idea of the effort and just

00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:14,860
a suggestion so one of the main thing

00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:17,049
that we want also to try to improve is

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,409
how to use this information in opus

00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:22,720
treatment to have a route oriented to

00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:24,700
disabled person in this case through

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,630
maybe a open on route services that has

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:32,220
profile specifically usable for a

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:34,720
wheelchair and thank you we have a

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,350
poster in the poster sessions you can

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,550
download the poster at that link and I'm

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,870
available for questions

00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,720
[Applause]

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,859
[Music]

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,859
[Applause]

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:51,300
perfect thank you so much so we have one

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,700
more talk and then we will do questions

00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,610
if people have them before heading over

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,130
to the poster session so very excited to

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:02,520
introduce Alessandra who is going to be

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:05,580
talking about crowd mapping for mental

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,390
health awareness so yeah looking forward

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,390
to hearing about it

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:38,080
hello ok I I have presented as the hot

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,280
summit but I was hoping to share this

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,930
with more people and gather more help on

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,820
especially young the projects mapping

00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:51,640
platform so anyways just a background

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:53,800
surveys show that there is a very low

00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,810
percentage of people who seek

00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:59,020
professional help for their mental

00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,790
health so the reason for this mostly is

00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,000
because of the stigma on mental health

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:05,680
and the discrimination against people

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,150
who have mental health problems so

00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,830
people are ashamed or afraid to share to

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:15,970
other people that they might be having

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:18,520
problems on mental health let alone seek

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:21,340
help or ask for any information and how

00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,200
to seek professional help so what we

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,720
wanted to do with this project is to

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,970
show where the years help is so if

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,210
there's a map I could easily look for

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:36,190
the places where to ask for professional

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:39,570
health and infirm the information would

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:42,010
be there I will show later what the

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:45,730
basic information you wanted to show on

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:49,330
the map are so anti dia is for anyone

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:52,180
anywhere with internet access to view

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,610
the map and contribute to the map to if

00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,170
they have additional places that they

00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:01,360
want to add to the map to help other

00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:05,020
people - so what we did first is to list

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,270
all the available sources or the

00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,190
information that are available in the

00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,470
Philippines that the mental health

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,380
services and resources that are that are

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,330
available and these are the important

00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,450
information one might need when looking

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:22,720
for professional help so named doctor so

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:25,420
and so forth and this is the mapping

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,470
platform I'm gonna quickly show it to

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,250
you so if you want to add a map here and

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:35,300
you can just click

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:38,870
and then at the point there and the the

00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:43,070
details that one my team can be added

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:46,310
here I'm not I don't have any coding

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:48,650
background so I just try do you learn

00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,860
this all very quickly through the help

00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:57,140
of github and all the other resources

00:21:51,860 --> 00:22:01,730
and anyway um the person anyone can ask

00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:03,560
can also locate their location so if for

00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,280
example I might have I'm at a clinic

00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:12,680
right now and it's not yet map I could

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:15,890
also add the location this uses geo

00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:19,040
locate a leaflet controller located and

00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:24,290
then osm geo coder for the search tool

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:29,960
and the data here is stored to a cartodb

00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:32,240
via SQL so anyway if anyone just wants

00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,120
to check information that's available

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,770
near them the points also show these

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:43,240
data so they're up if anyone needs or if

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:47,840
anyone here wants to contribute or add

00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:50,720
information or help improve the plaque

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,300
that platform please reach out I'll show

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,390
you the details later too and anyway

00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,610
aside from this platform we also have we

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:02,000
also conduct map patterns and for this

00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:05,300
week we use map contrib and we also

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,220
teach the basics of Open Street Map and

00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:14,240
use map contrib with the default tags so

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:20,950
healthcare and psychotherapy so since

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,950
these are points we also made before the

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:28,910
indoor yeah so they're um our first

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:35,120
mapathon was held last May and these are

00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:38,540
the map points so far yeah so from these

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,390
maps that I alone was mapping this is

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,630
now the the map where is more

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,120
collaborative

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,710
it also provides purpose based on

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,929
feedback from other mental health

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,179
advocates it somehow provides purpose

00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:53,070
for those with mental health problems

00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,890
they feel that they can help more to the

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:58,770
community and to those who are to have

00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,600
the same problems and these are also the

00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,600
other mapping projects on the on our

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,460
website so it's called mapping emotions

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,070
it encourages people to share their

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:11,010
mental health stories to show that

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,620
mental health occupies space it's real

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,830
and to also provide hope for those

00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,960
younger undergoing the same problems and

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:21,380
this one is here here as for those

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,970
people it's for those people who want to

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,990
who's willing to listen to anyone and

00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,990
they're going with mental health

00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,940
problems so most of the people here just

00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,590
input their Instagram or Twitter

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,690
accounts or social media accounts

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:38,760
because they they they are willing to

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:41,909
have to be reached out by other people

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,070
who for example um most people I have

00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:46,890
swished suicide ideations and it comes

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,929
at any time so some of these people need

00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:51,630
someone to talk to so they could just

00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:54,240
look here in the map and then see who's

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,610
near them and how can they contact them

00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,299
and they can talk to them anytime so

00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:09,200
there if you pull requests or walk out

00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:13,770
I'm sorry yeah yeah so here just please

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:17,780
contact us and the github username is

00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,780
this mental health awareness thank you

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:29,820
amazing thank you so much I'm so

00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,590
wondering if maybe all of the Lightning

00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,289
presenters could come to the front and

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,750
then just if we have questions we can go

00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:39,240
in and ask them I'm sure people are very

00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:41,220
keen to get to the drinks and nibbles in

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,100
the poster event so we'll keep it

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,230
relatively short if you have a question

00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,289
you got one mic over there one mic here

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:52,130
and please wait for us to get to you

00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:52,130
anybody wants to go first

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:16,170
a question to the Kosovo conference

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:18,720
people is is the logo that you have on

00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:23,730
the t-shirt is that the region can you

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:42,870
show that t-shirt is that southeastern

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:45,510
Europe many people don't want to be in

00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:48,720
the Balkans actually but more or less

00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:59,070
who are trying to represent still ista

00:26:48,720 --> 00:27:01,920
clear artistically thank you I have a

00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:08,030
question for Sandra just around what is
