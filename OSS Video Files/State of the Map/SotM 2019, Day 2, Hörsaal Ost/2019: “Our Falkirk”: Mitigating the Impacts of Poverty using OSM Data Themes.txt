Title: 2019: “Our Falkirk”: Mitigating the Impacts of Poverty using OSM Data Themes
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, Hörsaal Ost
Description: 
	Services that provide money advice, access to food provision, digital access and community support are key to supporting those facing poverty.  “Our Falkirk” is a simple mapping platform for service discovery that allows enriched OSM data to be easily described, mapped and shared through the concept of data ‘themes’.

Falkirk Council is one of 32 Local Authorities in Scotland. Located in the centre of Scotland with a population of around 155,000 people, 1 in 5 people and 1 in 4 children in the Falkirk Council area are estimated to be living in poverty.

Fairer Falkirk is Falkirk Council’s strategic response to the rising poverty in the Falkirk Council area.  It brings community planning partners together and sets out in detail a series of practical, deliverable, and achievable programmes aimed towards mitigating the impact of poverty on individuals and families.  Services that provide money advice, access to food provision, digital access and community support are key to supporting those facing poverty, but ensuring that local people and front-line staff have access to up-to-date information relating to these services is challenging.  

With funding from the Open Data Institute (ODI)’s Local Government Geospatial Data Stimulus Fund, Fairer Falkirk and their technology partner thinkWhere have harnessed the richness and flexibility of OpenStreetMap to create “Our Falkirk”: an online, map-based tool to allow local people to easily access information on services in the area. 

The presentation will look at how we’ve created a simple mapping platform for service discovery that allows enriched OSM data to be easily described, mapped and shared through the concept of data ‘themes’.  We’ll look at some of the key challenges and opportunities identified through this process, and show how taking an Open Data approach has allowed Falkirk Council to democratise access to vital information through the streamlining of data creation of publication.  We’ll look at potential next steps and sign-post the resources now available as a result of this fully open–sourced project.

hello welcome everyone to this session

00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,050
first up we have Alison moon from think

00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:21,670
we're who is speaking about fear or

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:25,599
Falkirk thanks ok hi I'm here today to

00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:29,050
talk about the our Falkirk project which

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,660
is an online community resource created

00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,160
with an for the fear of Falkirk team at

00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,399
Falkirk council the local government

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,989
organization in scotland to support the

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,110
work that they do to help minimize the

00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:43,630
impacts of poverty for those living in

00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,490
the Falkirk council area and does this

00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,770
by providing information on where to

00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,950
find particular types of support in the

00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:55,840
area the tool was designed using open

00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:58,390
data specifically OpenStreetMap and open

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,300
source technologies which is why i'm

00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,040
here to talk to you about it today I'll

00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,570
put up a slide at the end with lots of

00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,890
links and resources for anyone

00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,200
interested in finding out a little bit

00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,270
more including the link to the think

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,109
where a public github repo where you can

00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:16,210
find all of the code there's also a wiki

00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:18,490
page and also an wiki page and with a

00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:22,979
bit more about some of the the kind of

00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,979
tagging work that we we did

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,950
okay so just to provide some context

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,619
really as to what we're talking about as

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,180
I say for co-counsel it's a it's one of

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,560
32 local authority areas in Scotland

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,770
located right in the centre of Scotland

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,689
with a population of just over 150,000

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,159
people in terms of poverty in the area

00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:52,140
essentially it's it's really on a par

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,049
with the rest of the country it's where

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,539
an average at around 20 percent of

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,869
people living in relative poverty but

00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:03,060
this is expected to rise where folkert

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:08,130
council doesn't match the national

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,929
pattern is child poverty around 27

00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,780
percent of children live in poverty in

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:16,260
in the Falkirk council area which is

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,080
quite a staggering statistic obviously

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,360
this has an impact on them day to day in

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,319
terms of being cold going hungry not

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,769
being able to take part in activities

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,880
with their friends but it also impacts

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:33,180
their aspirations their achievements and

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,640
also their health just to give you a

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,130
couple of statistics here provided by

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,959
the fear of Falkirk teen by the age of

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,760
three poor children are estimated to be

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,980
on average nine months behind children

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,290
for more wealthy backgrounds that's by

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,350
the age of three and by sixteen children

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,370
receiving free school meals achieve 1.7

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,959
grades lower in their end of year exams

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:58,230
in work poverty is also a significant

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,350
problem so ensuring the employers pay

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,980
the living wage that jobs are

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,170
sustainable that there's in work

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,670
progression these all help to secure a

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,310
person's future and their ability to

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:12,000
plan ahead for themselves and their

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:15,870
families just to cover the last point

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,230
here the team do expect that poverty

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,230
rates will rise in the area do you in

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,989
part two changes in the Social Security

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,319
system which are currently being rolled

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,989
out and it's estimated that around 62

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,300
million pounds a year will be lost from

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:36,720
the Falkirk economy

00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,210
once fully rolled a so that's the kind

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,860
of scale of the problem that the team

00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:46,350
are facing with some really quite

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,850
worrying statistics so in terms of the

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,970
local authority that the local

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,820
government responds obviously they have

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,360
their fear of Falkirk team whose

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,970
responsibility is to try to sort of

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,960
ameliorate the situation and they have

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,370
as an organization with partners have

00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,910
devised a strategy which has recently

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,850
been refreshed for 2019 to 2024 called

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,710
towards a fear of Falkirk and this

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,120
strategy recognizes that neither the

00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:18,350
council nor its partners are going to be

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,420
able to lift those people out of poverty

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,390
necessarily what they can do is they can

00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,520
help to mitigate the impacts of poverty

00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:30,510
and mitigate these impacts on

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,280
individuals and children and families so

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,890
to achieve this the strategy focuses on

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,560
four key themes fear access to services

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,630
for a culture for your money and fairer

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,030
childhood and this is underpinned by an

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,920
action plan which details the steps to

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,830
be taken to deliver across all of these

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,740
themes so in terms of fear access to

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,990
services this is essentially the the

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:56,100
theme of the strategy in which the

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,800
fearful Kirk Project really sits there

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,440
looking to sort of help provide access

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,510
to money advice access to food provision

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,150
such as food banks which unfortunately

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:10,710
in Scotland we have all - too many of

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:12,810
but a real need for digital access and

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:16,320
community support so these are these are

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:20,760
key support services to those facing

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,700
poverty just to give you a bit of an

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,330
idea here the the the fear of Falkirk

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,850
team identify that there is a four

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,089
hundred and ninety pounds per year cost

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:37,849
of being poor

00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:39,959
so better digital access can help to to

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:41,969
mitigate that to some extent through

00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,579
things like online shopping getting

00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:47,159
better deals on utility bills better

00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:50,489
deals on mobile phones that that sort of

00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:52,739
thing but it's it's really providing

00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:56,039
access to those services that's quite

00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:58,589
quite crucial there are a range of

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,209
services available not just through the

00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:03,329
council but through its partners through

00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:06,169
churches community groups schools so on

00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:08,219
but bringing that information together

00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:10,409
packaging it up but making it available

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:15,059
to people in a way that is sustainable

00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:17,189
its flexible its cost effective Italian

00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:19,559
public sector budgets are squeezed to

00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:25,199
breaking point and that that's the

00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:31,169
challenge so obstacles to effective data

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:33,239
sharing well budgetary is significant in

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:35,449
terms of bringing in external resource

00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:39,769
or utilizing existing resource within

00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:42,539
the local authority to kind of tackle

00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:45,389
these kind of issues of data collation

00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:48,719
and dicta custodianship and technical

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:51,299
development support these are real

00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:55,349
issues not just financially but also in

00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:57,119
terms of skills and capacity what we

00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,939
find working with local authorities is

00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:02,219
that due to shrinking headcount very

00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,659
rapidly shrinking headcount the staff

00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:05,549
that are there are taking on more and

00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:09,809
more areas of responsibility and there

00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:16,279
is no spare capacity to look at some of

00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:16,279
these things so with that in mind

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,570
project and the way it came about

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:27,020
essentially was through the or di which

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,630
is the open data Institute's it's a non

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,490
for profit not profit not-for-profit

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,470
organization based in the UK whose

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,330
mission is to connect equipped and

00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,180
inspire people around the world to

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,790
innovate with data and last year they

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,760
created a new stimulus fund to encourage

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:47,990
better and innovative use of open

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,020
geospatial data in the UK and I think

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,260
where this is something that we thought

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,470
fantastic

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,290
there's definitely got to be some really

00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:00,950
exciting projects that we can sort of

00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:03,890
help to get going with that kind of

00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:06,530
support so just to quickly tell you a

00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,270
little bit about who we are we're an

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,850
independent and web mapping and GIS

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,910
consultancy based in Stirling again in

00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:17,320
the centre of Scotland we're specialists

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:21,950
in open source GIS and technologies and

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:24,050
our sort of core platform the map cloud

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,330
is kind of based on that full sort of

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,830
open spatial stack Bush just geoserver

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:34,130
mat proxy the whole the whole works but

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:37,039
while we're now a private limited

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,229
company our history and our lineage is

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,000
really sort of rooted in the public

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,180
sector in that we were a shared service

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,050
for three local government organisations

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:50,570
for a number of years before then in

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:55,880
2007 sort of spinning off as a separate

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:58,220
sort of private company so you know we

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,980
we have really close ties with local

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,220
government a real understanding of the

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,860
kind of issues and pressures that they

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,950
face we're also keen advocates and users

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:13,930
of open data if you were here for the

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:17,900
previous talk you have heard from the

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:20,450
hot osm tasking manager team and about

00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:27,070
their plans for version 4 of the tasking

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:29,210
manager and will in 2017 we think we're

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,240
redevelop the tasking manager a complete

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,300
rewrite

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:38,610
all on Amazon Web Services so fully

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:43,749
scalable lots more in there in terms of

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:45,939
sort of user engagement and and so forth

00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,980
and that so that would that something

00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:50,290
that as an organization where we're

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,550
hugely proud of and also very excited to

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:58,959
see where the the new hot dev team are

00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:01,300
taking that we also have members of

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,089
staff working for map action on

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:07,990
deployment and host regular missing Maps

00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:11,920
events in Sterling so uh I suppose

00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:14,050
bringing that kind of service the art

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,429
experience and our skills together you

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,069
know obviously having working worked

00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:19,379
closely with various local government

00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:21,610
organizations over many years and also

00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:23,649
working with us and a good deal we

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,300
started to think about the problems

00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:27,790
associated with effective data sharing

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,819
in local government and to think about

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,829
the potential for OpenStreetMap to be

00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:34,540
used to open up access to information to

00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:36,699
local communities and at this point we

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,129
approached Volker council and their fara

00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:41,290
Falkirk team with an idea which thanks

00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:44,649
to the funding provided by the open data

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:47,999
Institute then became the our Falkirk

00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:50,829
project so the aims are pretty simple

00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:52,119
for the local authority really what they

00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:54,579
were looking for is just to provide a

00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:56,230
simple web mapping application that

00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:57,970
makes information about local services

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:01,269
available to people online so that's

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:04,959
both to members of the public but also

00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:07,689
crucially to frontline staff you know

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,939
whether that be a member of the local

00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:12,399
government working in a kind of public

00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:15,429
facing role such as a kind of one-stop

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,779
shop or it could be a nursery nurse it

00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:20,139
could be a teacher it it just could be

00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:21,819
people working directly with members of

00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:24,459
the public who are then better able to

00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:27,369
signpost those people when in need to

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:30,029
the services that they might be able to

00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:30,029
benefit from

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,410
so how does it fit together well the

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,950
central idea was to create a really

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,390
lightweight application in which the

00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:44,950
data both the background mapping data

00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:47,740
and the the kind of feature data would

00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,180
all come directly from OpenStreetMap so

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,230
basically none of that data would need

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,180
to be stored or managed or maintained by

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:58,630
the local government organization by the

00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,550
local council so what the application is

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,700
doing is it's using an API to

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:06,280
dynamically search the OSM dataset for

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,580
features within that bounding box within

00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:13,270
that area that map that match a

00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,910
particular set of osm tags or SM

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,550
attributes and I'll talk a little bit

00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,140
about the tagging in a sec as I said

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,450
it's really like rip like wait it's

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,550
written using the react frameworks

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,190
hosted on AWS so you just need somewhere

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:30,460
to host that website no database no DBA

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:32,140
none of that and like I say the codes on

00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,610
github so the the hope would be that

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,270
other local authorities could just pick

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:41,170
this up and run with it themselves don't

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:44,290
need specialist skills to maintain or

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:47,620
create data browser based tools and a

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:50,560
little bit of guidance which obviously

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,150
we've provided directly to the fara

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,140
Falkirk team for them now to take that

00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:57,700
forward but hopefully you know that

00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,530
means that it's much more likely that

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,320
the data will be maintained kept up to

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,930
date you know by local members of the

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,730
public - or other sort of partner bodies

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,160
to make sure that as the new services

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,660
come online or our services change or

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,460
potentially disappear you know that that

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,610
will mean that the data's kind of live

00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:21,100
and current so it might not sound like

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,230
anything that's too kind of the ordinary

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,780
you know obviously within this context

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,980
but for the local government to be using

00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:32,380
that kind of approach you know obviously

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,870
it's something it's a slight step change

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,690
in

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,120
- perceived lack of control over data

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,250
but I think they were excited to give

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,529
the approach ago so I'm gonna have to

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:47,089
push on so in terms of the data themes

00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:50,150
these were the teams that the themes

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:51,710
that the the fara Falkirk team and their

00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,120
partners thought would give the best

00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,070
value with all so that they would be

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,270
able to sort of fairly readily collect

00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:01,160
that information and like I say these

00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,710
themes are essentially logical groups of

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,710
osm features defined by logical groups

00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,690
of tags so in this case these are the

00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,730
thing but essentially the idea of a kind

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:14,240
of theme of the new SMS sort of you know

00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:20,029
it could be um it could be used for any

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:22,910
kind of purpose really so I won't say

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:25,040
too much about that but essentially just

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,930
to give you an idea that the challenge

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,690
for us I think because we're not experts

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:32,480
in osm was really to define the best set

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:34,370
of tags to use in each case both to

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,680
define those features and then also the

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:40,060
attributes of those features and that

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:44,089
would be sort of relevant to an end user

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:47,779
so we're not experts we're just really

00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:49,550
trying to work with or work on the basis

00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:54,529
that if we use the tanks that are most

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:56,150
commonly already and use and we used tag

00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,790
in for extensively to research these

00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,470
tags and we also had a lot of help and

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,420
guidance from the USA and UK community

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,089
and the top do you be mailing lists and

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:08,480
they provided a lot of insight and input

00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:11,209
into how best to define a set of tags

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,589
that would have you know the most

00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:17,870
applicability and longevity so the idea

00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:21,529
is once we got these sort of groups of

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:23,600
tags defined and like I say this is just

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:26,000
the kind of you know the information

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,300
about those features and it was then

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,830
really a question of looking at the data

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,030
enriching the data both with new

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,900
features

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:37,430
and new new tags on existing features

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,690
what we did find was things like food

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,460
banks and it might be located in a

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,260
church and the church might be a feature

00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,840
within OS m but that food bank we might

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,820
need to create our own feature to

00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,100
capture the information that's relevant

00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,900
because the opening times of a church

00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,030
might be different to the opening times

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,590
of that food bank we might need to you

00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,930
know look at how we actually work with

00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:59,860
the data that's there and develop that

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:02,090
to meet the needs of this but

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,000
essentially once we've got that data in

00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:07,250
to the database we're then looking at

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,170
defining the theme within a config file

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:14,990
which is what the application uses it

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:16,910
that conflict file will determine well

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,070
it basically specify what the themes

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,420
about the group of tags that comprise it

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:24,110
and how it should be displayed by the

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,700
application and then it uses it to sort

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,900
of dynamically pull back the relevant

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,360
features now I'll have to go through

00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,040
this really quickly but more than happy

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,250
to cover any of this off at the end and

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,920
make all these materials available but

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,440
essentially so the theme we're kind of

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,710
setting a really lightweight schema that

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,780
we think could be used in any kind of

00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,240
context but obviously there's a specific

00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,300
context here and but it has sort of key

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,040
elements to it

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,810
metadata the name of the person who's

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:59,000
authored this the description the

00:16:53,810 --> 00:17:02,030
purpose then you know looking at the

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,670
actual tags that define the types of

00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,589
features that we want to pull back and

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,569
the attributes that we might also want

00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:11,449
to pull back to display to the user

00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,130
and how we're going to use how we're

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:15,319
going to display that information within

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,490
the application so the icon to be used

00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:22,540
the colors on and then we're using

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:26,449
creating overpass to get the data out of

00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:28,310
the OSM D to B so that's in a specific

00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,710
format so that's actually encoded within

00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,050
the within the theme as well yeah like I

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,970
say the core idea of the themes is they

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,180
should be shareable you know this is a

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,570
sort of schema that sets a

00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:43,690
it's kind of an exemplar really and then

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:46,450
but potentially you know those schemas

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:49,809
could be shared they could be you know

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:52,540
tweaked adapted and then and then used

00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:55,120
as needed in other contexts so like I

00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,530
say the config file that then reads in

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,750
the information from the database

00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:02,080
according to the parameters that are set

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:04,630
I and the application then determines

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,370
what information it's going to you know

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:09,340
present to the user because obviously

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:11,290
we're working with DITA we don't unlike

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,790
in another context where you know you

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,950
define the database schema we don't

00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:18,580
necessarily know what data we're going

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:21,580
to get back but the config file helps to

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,050
kind of work out based on the data that

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,440
we do get back then what we're going to

00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:28,480
present to the user I'm running it a

00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,040
little short of time so I won't do a

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,110
demo but essentially it's super

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:36,700
straightforward you know it's it's a

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:39,250
really straightforward web app that the

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,230
informations kind of organized by theme

00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:44,040
and then you click on it and you see

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,600
that little pop-up and you can find out

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,670
not just where it is and what sorting

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,790
times are but things like you know if

00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,020
it's access to computers within a public

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,660
library you know do you need to be a

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:58,840
member of that library you know does it

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,640
have Wi-Fi as they're printing and again

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,630
that's where the group did a lot of work

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,130
to define what what attributes a user

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,040
would actually be interested in finding

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:12,130
out about different types of services so

00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,480
yeah whether or not there's printing

00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,340
that that's relevant to a certain type

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,770
of feature another type of feature

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,179
within a different theme you know there

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:23,530
might be other bits of information that

00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:26,950
are much more relevant so just to look

00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:31,600
at the the outcomes of that obviously

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:35,230
the art Falkirk say is live and in use

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,380
and I think the the team are really

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,760
excited about the possibilities of it

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:43,230
and are looking to develop it further

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,029
I think what's kind of interesting is

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,309
and the fact that obviously the the

00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:50,700
approach means that non-expert users can

00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:51,870
map features within these themes in

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
terms of setting up the themes

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,309
themselves I think they're still quite

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,809
there's still a bit of a kind of

00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,700
learning curve to go through to do that

00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:01,649
in terms of what tags do you use how do

00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,519
you do that setting up the config file

00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:08,190
and so on but you know it's all open so

00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,590
it's possible to do that and it's just

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,789
the tagging bit you know I think we

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,419
found that that's where our learning

00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:17,610
curve really really kicked in and again

00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:21,510
kind of keeping overheads to a minimum

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:24,990
in terms of IT and sort of those kind of

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:28,169
data management skills that was

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,269
something that was quite you know it was

00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:31,769
quite helpful for the for the local

00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:34,409
government organization there to see

00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:37,380
that from an osm perspective I think

00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:40,139
obviously the you know the data theme

00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,519
idea you know defining a logical group

00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,539
of features in osm I think that's

00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,809
something that could have wider

00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:49,019
applicability through the use and reuse

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:52,500
of those and that kind of schema that's

00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:55,799
been set out but you know I think it's

00:20:52,500 --> 00:21:00,740
just something that you know probably

00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:02,940
needs more kind of input going forward

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,710
but we kind of showed how you could use

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,740
existing tags and extend these with new

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:12,659
tags with the aim being that those would

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:14,039
become more widely adopted I think what

00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:15,720
we found was that the the kind of

00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:21,419
process for suggesting new tags and

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:23,250
themes was not that clear you know

00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:28,799
sounds really flexible but sometimes I

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:29,940
think not quite sure where to start so

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,260
in terms of just quickly future

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,460
perspectives I can say fear I felt

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,870
correctly are keen to expand the

00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,450
audience and also enhance the data

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:41,880
content of the tool so furniture

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:45,170
provision children's activities even

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,800
sort of possibly temporal or seasonal

00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:53,180
services so summer and Christmas food

00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,470
projects school holiday programs school

00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,910
holidays can be a real challenge for

00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,800
families on low incomes because they

00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,390
lose those free school meals that they

00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,910
would normally have return time and so

00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:04,430
on so that's something that they want to

00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,410
to look at further and take forward and

00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:10,130
work on their own the kind of promotion

00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:14,870
of it in terms of how we might take this

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:17,180
for it and in terms of OSM you know I

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,770
think the idea that we we had originally

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,830
though it didn't quite get to that stage

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:24,970
was a theme creation wizard and allowing

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:30,350
people to you know through some kind of

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:32,000
UI define their own schema you know give

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,740
it a name give it a description

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,390
you know select the tags they want to

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,590
use like I said I think we're a bit away

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,930
from that I think we just need to think

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,870
about how how easy it is to kind of

00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:44,930
define those tags I you know may be a

00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:46,730
bit bit further down the line but also

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:50,390
looking at further implementations and I

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:53,000
know that there is a you know a bath act

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:55,430
event recently done in the South of

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,650
England they work the record and they

00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,810
they kind of provided an implementation

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,940
of it so I'll just leave you with this

00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:05,120
slide here in terms of any of the links

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:07,010
if you want to check those out what I

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,890
would like to see is a big thank you to

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,480
Sally Buchanan and her team at Falkirk

00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,970
Council within the fara Falkirk team

00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,920
because you know all of this stems

00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:19,580
really from their ideas and enthusiasm

00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,320
and our work with the partners in terms

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,600
of pooling all that information together

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,000
and defining you know how they wanted

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,690
this application to work and what they

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,450
wanted to have in it and also OSN UK

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:36,170
particularly Jen's Nicholson it was very

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:38,060
you know generous with his time but you

00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,800
know that was that really helped us to

00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,090
kind of get things moving in terms of

00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,190
our use of OSM

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,520
and to finding those tagging schemers

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,610
and that is me so thanks very much for

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,610
listening

00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:56,180
[Music]

00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:59,740
thank you so much Alison I see we

00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,740
already have some questions so

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:12,269
[Music]

00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:16,470
and thank you it looks great I wondered

00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:20,549
if you had any data about the usage and

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:24,119
the impact that it's had we don't yet I

00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:27,690
think it's something that the fear of

00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:29,759
Falkirk team are quite keen are quite

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,350
keen to look at so that might be

00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:35,279
something that we can take forward with

00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:37,559
them in the future because obviously it

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,450
looks great but who's using it to what

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,759
extent it actually benefits those

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,769
directly because obviously where you're

00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,070
seeing digital access as an issue it's

00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:48,570
an online system and yeah we would like

00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:52,109
to think that frontline staff are able

00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:55,049
to signpost and so on but yeah I think

00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:57,419
it's something that the team are quite

00:24:55,049 --> 00:25:00,119
keen to look at within fear Falkirk and

00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:07,320
hopefully we'll get some data that we

00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:09,419
can then do something with yeah I'd also

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,480
just wondered if there has been any

00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:16,019
take-up or interest from other LA's

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:21,379
local authorities like I said I think

00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:24,299
there was and maybe not formally but

00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:28,230
down in bath they had done our kind of

00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:30,779
hat hackathon type event and they've

00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:34,919
certainly taken taking the code on

00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:36,629
github and got it got it running so it's

00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:39,119
all there I think it's kind of about

00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:41,789
getting the message a I mean as part of

00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:45,029
the project we've published a series of

00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:47,820
blogs on what was going on and trying to

00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:51,330
sort of target that towards a wider

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,950
local government audience I don't know

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,320
if there might be a reluctance to kind

00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:57,619
of move into our kind of more open data

00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,629
space by some local authorities I think

00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:03,480
some are at different points and they're

00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:07,080
kind of thinking around that but I would

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,929
like to see that certainly do you have

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,639
any rough figures for how many of the

00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:12,470
people in poverty do have internet

00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:15,260
access

00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:17,630
and also how much is illiteracy a

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,450
problem that if they could access they

00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:22,130
might have difficulty reading it yeah I

00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,370
think that would probably be a question

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:29,080
for the fear of Falkirk team and they

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:31,520
may well have that kind of information

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,880
obviously digital access is a huge

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:39,260
barrier I'm not sure to what extent

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,120
literacy might be also but I think it's

00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,460
finding finding the ways to reach those

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,090
people who otherwise might not be able

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:50,170
to to kind of access this and that will

00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:52,220
be the kind of kind of sort of role a

00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:54,560
engagement piece within the local

00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,180
authority and with partners and so on to

00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,520
say look this is a resource if people

00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,760
come to you with a need please make sure

00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,590
that you are aware and can use this so

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,990
that you can signpost so it might be

00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,950
that you know this isn't directly

00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,710
public-facing

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,570
in in those instances there's a kind of

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,460
intermediary to go through but it it's

00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,290
just having that engagement going on

00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,680
within the organization to make sure

00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,680
that happens

00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:21,830
thank you

00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,900
