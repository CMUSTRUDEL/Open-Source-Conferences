What is an OSMF working group, what does the membership working group in particular do, and how can you improve the experience of an OSMF membership.

The OSMF working groups are the main way in which the foundation supports OSM in specific areas. I am part of the membership working group since 2016. I will talk about working groups in general, what we do in the membership working group, and also talk about my experience in the latter. In the last year, we had quite a few new things going on like the fee-waiver program, we could improve our processes by using a support tracker and getting part of our procedures finally written down. And then there was the ever increasing wave of member sign ups before the elections, which this year raised the question of how we can protect the OSMF from being taken over by lots of new members from a particular interest group. There is still a lot of room for improvements of the experience for the OSMF members, and a few tasks that are still unresolved will be discussed in the last part of my presentation. And maybe you are interested in helping with one of them. We are all volunteers and it turns out some things need quite a bit of time and endurance to get done. We would be glad to get new participants to our group.

so hi I'm Michael I'm on the membership

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,529
working group since 2016 and I wanted to

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,060
do the presentation not only about the

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,130
membership working group but about a

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:29,329
system of the working groups in general

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:32,400
on the OS MF so I'll start by

00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:35,340
introducing what's the what is the

00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,010
working group I'll then tell a bit more

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,250
about the working group I I know my

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:46,500
experiences activities what we did in

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:50,969
about last year we had an incident which

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:54,600
was quite widely known which Guillaume

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,309
will tell you a bit more about it and of

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,999
course in the end we will like to

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,820
motivate you to participate in our

00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:04,470
awesome working group or in some other

00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:10,620
OpenStreetMap or treatment foundation

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:14,940
working group so I hope most of you know

00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,350
what the OpenStreetMap foundation is the

00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,730
obvious treatment foundation is just

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,620
this tiny little dot in the huge Elm

00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:28,730
Street Map community which is embedded

00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:32,850
in the even larger OpenStreetMap global

00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:36,350
movement with all the consumers of our

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:43,320
data the album Street Map foundation

00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:46,320
holds the trademark they own the servers

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,540
they keep the server's running for

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,390
formatting for our activities next to

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,560
the OS MF we also have lots of other

00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:01,080
small groups which are organized as

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,710
associations like the local chapters or

00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:10,910
special interest groups and so the OS MF

00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:13,130
is is a necessity it's there

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,500
to supports the OpenStreetMap project

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,510
but it is not like controlling the

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,820
OpenStreetMap

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:29,180
project inside the up Street Map

00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:30,740
Foundation we have the board and apart

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,540
from the board there are the working

00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:40,640
groups which are doing kind of the work

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:44,420
the real work that is done it's all

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:53,990
volunteer driven so almost nobody gets

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:58,210
paid it's it's a construct to organize

00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:02,710
the effort to get together all different

00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:08,000
volunteers around one specific aspects

00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:12,760
we also need this formalization to get

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,650
some access control so you get special

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,690
yes special access like to the

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,160
membership register if you are in the

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,400
membership working group and of course

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,050
you have to sign some paperwork which

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,980
says what you can do and what you can't

00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:35,090
do with your special access but like the

00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,490
the conclusion of all this is if nobody

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:41,150
wants to do it it doesn't get done

00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:44,090
because we are not employees the support

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:48,170
can not tell us really what to do

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:50,510
because well you can just move on and of

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,300
course there is some feeling of

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:57,260
obligation but you will also see that

00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,660
often times things can take very long

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,870
until they are done in the working

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,870
groups

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,680
so as an example the membership working

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,739
groups

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,549
what's our duties well we tends to the

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:20,329
register obviously that means we answer

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:25,580
routine questions like is if my

00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:27,820
membership still valid or I changed my

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:32,780
address can you update my email address

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:35,540
we also support the voting by tallying

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:39,830
the votes and we try to grow the

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:42,350
membership I talked about access of

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,979
course we get access to the membership

00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:50,270
register with all the details we get

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:54,560
power to read to do renewals to add and

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,770
remove members and for that we of course

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:04,220
need to sign this non-disclosure

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:06,889
agreement there are a lot of other

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,229
working groups we have the operations

00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:12,139
working group I said oh SMF is running

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:14,770
the servers those are the great guys who

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,970
look after the servers and make that

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,539
everything is running smoothly that we

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:24,530
can map at any hour of the day we just

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:28,610
had a presentation from someone from the

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:32,560
licensing working group there's the data

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:36,229
work group which is for vandalism and

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,380
similar topics we have an engineering

00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:44,360
working group we have communication

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,919
working group and of course without them

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,030
we wouldn't be here the state of the map

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,030
organizing committee

00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:03,180
how does the membership group work so I

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:06,030
joined in 2016 I was taught by then that

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,450
the group was restarted for the third

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:14,940
time so that's kind of risk that it all

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:17,850
fizzles out that all the people that

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:21,960
were on the working group just yeah

00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:26,580
walked away I got some introduction to

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:29,430
ccrm which is the open software of use

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,380
for the register I got the introduction

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,420
by the board members because what the

00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:41,070
workgroups don't do that falls back onto

00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:44,190
the board members somehow and yeah I

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:51,060
just learn to answer some of the

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:52,440
questions I good to note for the for

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,740
signing up so when you renew your

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,860
membership this is fully automatic with

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:03,600
PayPal so there we have not so much to

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:06,450
that's great we also administer the OS

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,110
MF talk mailing list which is for our

00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,729
staff members only so we can subscribe

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,570
people's who want to be on that mailing

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:19,550
list and of course we do have the

00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:25,290
regular or more or less regular meetings

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:28,860
we meet online and discuss certain

00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:36,050
topics problems we have and how we can

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:36,050
do better in the future the new things

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:49,140
sorry what we did about it last year we

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:51,300
had some long-standing mail problems you

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,820
get some reminder emails when you need

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,280
to renew your membership because well

00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,880
it's once a year it's easily to forget

00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,669
but really badly it turns out some of

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,420
those mails were not sent out we had

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:08,290
quite a long time to tractor

00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:10,710
aerotyne but was persistent but yeah we

00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:13,900
were luckily able to fix it with some

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,880
external help

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,720
we were also writing down procedures

00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,730
like I said in the beginning I was

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,560
taught by someone from the board how to

00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,990
do all these things it wasn't written

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:30,040
down so now we have at least a little

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:32,350
bit of introduction for new members of

00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,040
the membership working groups how to

00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:39,130
operate it's not that much but it's good

00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:44,760
when it's written down we introduced

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:44,760
ltrs for handling our day-to-day tasks

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:55,480
we have we got a lot more to do when we

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:58,510
introduce the feel diver program we are

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,000
needed to look at all the applicants and

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,700
that just didn't work out any more

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,180
likely up right before with just mailing

00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,400
stuff around like yell answer that and

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,390
oh I have answered this and does

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,540
somebody know that and now we have this

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,920
this after for support requests it's

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:22,090
originally other working groups were

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:25,360
already using it so it was quite easy

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:29,650
for us to piggyback on that and also use

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,190
that software we improved the membership

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:35,980
work the group page which was

00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:40,810
practically empty before now we have at

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:46,260
least a little bit of text and the we

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,260
cut the fee waiver program more on that

00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:55,210
that's actually quite an old thing it

00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:59,370
was from 2014 resolution which was then

00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:01,840
accepted by the members of the OS MF and

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,880
it was the task of the membership

00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,880
working group to make some procedures

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,329
around them

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,440
the TV programs as we can accept members

00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:17,970
without paying the usual membership fee

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:21,750
if they have no option to pay because

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:24,870
lack of banking facilities or if it's

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:28,470
just an unreasonable financial burden

00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:33,230
because 15 pounds can be a lot of money

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:37,860
in certain parts of the world and we had

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:40,019
some things already in place like we

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,259
have list from our PayPal is not

00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:46,920
available that's a sure thing that they

00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:50,670
just don't have it's available to be a

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,610
member that easily we have the form for

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:56,910
people to apply for the fee behavior but

00:10:53,610 --> 00:11:01,290
we were really stuck for years on some

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:03,000
other things like the fever says the

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,819
person had to contribute something else

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,579
of value to the OS MF and that's a

00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:14,160
really soft condition and very hard to

00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:17,810
see objectively to to test it

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,600
objectively and also to have a rule for

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:25,310
financial hardship how can we define if

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:31,980
15 pounds for that particular person is

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:34,290
enough or not so before the elections in

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,240
2018 someone insisted on being as

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:40,439
accepted under the fifth behavior

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:43,589
program which kind of put us in higher

00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:47,189
gear so we had to be hurriedly rolled it

00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:51,089
out with the help of the board we

00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:55,410
finalized the money transfer case we

00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:58,800
selected for the something else of value

00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:01,769
the same as we have in the Act active

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:06,079
contributor clause in our contribution

00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:08,639
guidelines which just as you have to

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,600
have contributed in three different

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,130
months in the last year we regarded as

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,220
an active contributor

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,590
and for the other financial hardship

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:25,860
case we rely on the board to decide on a

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:30,360
case-by-case basis so I hand over to Jim

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:32,970
thank you so one big thing we had on the

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:38,130
membership working group last year was

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:43,410
just before the board election there was

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:45,630
this big big wave of new users and there

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,830
were all associate members did quick

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:58,050
show of hands who's an OS MF member

00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:59,610
hello yeah joiners so as most of you

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:04,560
apparently know we have two kinds of

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:06,600
membership associate and oh dear what's

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,260
the other one no more normal members

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,680
thank you I should know this and all of

00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:17,760
them were associate members all of them

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:19,710
had gmail email addresses so all of them

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:25,170
had Gmail addresses all of them were

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:27,660
from India and the IP addresses of those

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:32,100
accounts were associated with one

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,870
company so I saw this it was a pure

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,500
coincidence that I saw this there was

00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:40,350
just before the election and the French

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,320
community had had a great campaign - hey

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,780
we are underrepresented in the u.s. m-f

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,820
we should do something about it and lots

00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,040
of them signed up so I was wondering our

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,820
other countries underrepresented can we

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,370
check and I found out that there was a

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,090
one country that was highly

00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:01,110
over-represented and that it was very

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:03,360
fresh so I notified the board and the

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,570
board decided that there's when you sign

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,720
up as a man

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,990
there are seven days where the

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,640
foundation can reject membership so I

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:16,960
asked the board hey should we reject

00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:20,140
this and see what's up the board did not

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,209
reject the memberships then I notified

00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,950
the other candidates and said hey should

00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:26,350
we should we talk to the board and we

00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:32,080
fivers of the candidates for the board

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:35,230
sent a letter to the board and and then

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,810
it turned out that those people they

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,459
thought they had signed up just in time

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,220
to vote for the election there's a

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:45,520
cut-off data of 30 days before the

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,800
election where you have to be a member

00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,630
so that you can vote and they signed up

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,040
just after because of a misunderstanding

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:56,800
that I thought it was the day after so

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,410
it turns out they couldn't vote and so

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,529
after the election the membership

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:07,720
working group decided to investigate and

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:11,740
we produced a report and it's it's yeah

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,250
22 pages sorry who's read it show of

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,950
hands

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:21,810
of course you yeah and so it's quite

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:25,709
long and we concluded that it was

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:29,200
orchestrated campaign by one company

00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:31,510
that the company was not being truthful

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,060
there were several contradiction and

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:38,800
things that just didn't make sense in

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:40,839
what we were being told and we concluded

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,870
that it was probably aimed at

00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:47,410
influencing the election how we don't

00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:49,270
know who was behind it we don't know I'm

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,800
not gonna go through the 22 pages you

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,320
can if you have trouble falling asleep

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,339
you can read them that I'm gonna go

00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:00,540
through the key evidence so one thing

00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:03,220
we're really lucky to have is we had

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,930
control group like when you when you

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,339
decide if a medicine is good or not you

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,339
have a control group that gets the

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:09,769
placebo and so we're really lucky we had

00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:12,649
about

00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:15,410
French people sign up in the last few

00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:17,660
days and they were showing very

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,300
different patterns and the French group

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,489
understood the deadline correctly and

00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,569
the Indian group didn't but I made the

00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:28,399
same mistake but also it was a lot more

00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:31,100
concentrated in one big wave and the

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,199
French group it took a few email and a

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,850
few tweets and everything to encourage

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,559
people to join and it was a lot more

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,939
spread out so that was quite different

00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:43,639
and then all you thought you know why

00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:45,499
don't we contact them so we wrote an

00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,799
email to all of them welcome to the

00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:53,420
OpenStreetMap foundation a lot of you

00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:57,350
have joined and what happened and what

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:59,600
made you decide to and so on and we sent

00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:03,019
the same email in French and in English

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,020
to the two groups and the response we

00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:09,740
got was quite different the French group

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,779
replied very quickly and had suggestions

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,779
and they all had very different messages

00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:19,579
some of them were one-liners others were

00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:22,760
like pages and the Indian group they

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:25,789
trickled in at one per day after a week

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,679
and they all looked pretty similar some

00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:31,940
of them even used the same words

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:34,539
Steve Steve Friedel who co-wrote the

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,309
report with me we were laughing because

00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:39,080
an email came in and we were betting on

00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:45,470
whether it would have the word mandatory

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:47,840
in it it did another thing we found is

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,059
that many people signed up writing the

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,580
name in lowercase and you have one of

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:56,090
them that's normal that's not nothing

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:58,120
but there we had all of a sudden 21

00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,540
people working at the same company

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,420
entering the

00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:09,010
the names in lowercase and we compare

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,600
that with the with them we thought it

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:15,760
might be a cultural things that we

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:17,740
compared with with other Indian members

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,960
of the u.s. MF we'd find that they were

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,970
just like everyone else entering a mix

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:27,550
of uppercase and lowercase but mostly

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:30,280
but the first letter in uppercase so we

00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:33,610
concluded that this was almost certainly

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,590
someone typing in the names from a list

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:43,210
during all the memberships one by one

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:45,010
and so yeah it was it was complete luck

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,510
that we had these control groups that we

00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,720
were able to find that evidence that we

00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:54,280
saw the problem was there in the first

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:58,270
place and complete luck that there was a

00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,530
misunderstanding in the deadlines but

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,460
what happened next so we wrote that

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:07,870
report and then sent it out to the board

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:10,510
and then to everyone at mwg we tighten

00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:14,560
the procedures we now check when you

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:16,510
enter a username we check it's a valid

00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,020
OpenStreetMap username we ask for the

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,360
employer we have reports coming out when

00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,420
you become a member

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,160
mwg will get an alert because before

00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,050
that we had no idea what was happening

00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,970
in cv serum if you don't get to check

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,980
you don't see anything now we get

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:36,460
reports and all other kinds of stuff

00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:40,450
which help us have a better idea of

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:44,110
what's happening and then the board

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:49,540
contacted global logic to discuss this

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:51,299
and in the end we got a list of

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:55,630
employees and

00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:57,190
clever logic agreed to cancel I think

00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,100
was the verb use to cancel the

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,049
memberships and we took that list we

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,320
compared that with our list contacted

00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:07,360
the people and five of them are stay you

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,110
know I'd like to stay so we let them

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:15,610
stay and every other membership has been

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:16,870
cancelled but there's also stuff that's

00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,740
gonna happen next we're gonna keep

00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:23,620
improving the procedures the checks the

00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:29,580
and true the data you enter when you

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:32,230
become a member we are going to do more

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,150
more reporting so we can keep a better

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,830
eye we're going to validate the email

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,230
addresses maybe and we thought maybe

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,240
have a checkbox that says my employer is

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,429
paying for my membership things like

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,500
that we don't have all ideas so if you

00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:49,870
have ideas raise your hand after the

00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:53,740
talk and we are also with the board

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:56,200
talking about changing updating the

00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,789
articles of association Yost and I shed

00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:04,750
ice cream the other day discussing that

00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:08,789
for example looked at that delay the

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:12,100
7-day delay to cancel a membership is

00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:16,600
quite short actually to have a look at

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:20,020
what's happening so to lengthen that two

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,270
to thirty days I think to give us a

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:25,140
better chance of reacting things like

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:31,630
that so the articles of association

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:34,200
being looked at and something that we

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:38,230
should discuss as a community is what

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,480
what is a member and how do you define

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:44,320
membership is it enough to just pay a

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,590
membership fee or some other communities

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,990
for example ours Gio and Hart have a

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:53,100
requirement that you have to be invited

00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:57,990
to become a voting member

00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:00,570
and another group the documentation the

00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,390
people doing LibreOffice they have a

00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:06,570
requirement that to become a voting

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:09,539
member you have to have the colored skin

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:12,000
in the game you have to have a certain

00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:14,160
contribution to qualify as a voting

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,710
member and I like that more than having

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,110
a group that's by invitation because

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:23,190
anyone can map their way into the voting

00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:24,990
members and it limits the people

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,179
involved in taking the decisions to

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,370
people who really are involved in the

00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,650
process how do we define the skin in the

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,360
game is it a number of edits some people

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,960
do great stuff up in street map but

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,280
don't edit a lot so we have to find

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,320
flexible ways but I think that's a

00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:45,750
conversation that would be interesting

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:47,549
to have that's it from me no to you yeah

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:52,200
I think we are open for questions now

00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:55,289
almost like oh let's have that could we

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,580
have all the questions at the end thank

00:22:55,289 --> 00:23:05,789
you okay it's just should I do the

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:09,270
outlook so I think most of its DM has

00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:15,120
already said from the perspective of

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:17,240
that membership so to grow the

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,850
membership we want to improve the

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,190
membership fee waiver program as I said

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:25,980
it's not really finished it's it's very

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:32,370
manual process for the financial

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:35,429
hardship case and okay that's the point

00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:38,309
where I have to say we are very open to

00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:40,620
people who are interested in these

00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:44,400
topics to come join us

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:46,940
you don't have to join formally to work

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,590
on any of these topics you can just

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,770
contribute as you like you can become a

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:55,149
formal member of the membership or group

00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:58,039
however you like

00:23:55,149 --> 00:24:01,429
other things we want to is publish

00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:05,950
regularly updated statistics that's also

00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:10,370
for the general public to see

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:14,750
fluctuations and yeah just strange

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:17,149
things pick them up we have the point of

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,570
growing the membership if you have paid

00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:24,620
attention we have done really nothing

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:27,799
about that there was one effort of a

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,600
membership drive which was spearheaded

00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:34,250
by the communications working group I

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:37,610
think so I just put an ad on the OSM

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,980
main page hey you should become a member

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,899
of the OSM F but apart from that that's

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,779
really a broad topic topic we would

00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:48,799
would be awesome if people would work on

00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:52,610
that we want to do a membership sales

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:55,429
service area people are a little bit

00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:57,440
uncomfortable that like yeah now I'm a

00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:00,440
member but I don't have a login or

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,179
anything so you can't even see for

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,700
yourself that you're what what the

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:09,409
status of your membership is that we

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:11,480
would be awesome for a feedback and we

00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:14,149
want to have a patch on the

00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,690
OpenStreetMap tool org main page because

00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:19,340
that's also sometimes a request now I'm

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:23,809
a member of the u.s. RF hey I want to

00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:26,390
show or I want to prove to the world

00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:35,179
that I am a member of the OSM F which we

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:37,370
come to at moments as well so please

00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:39,529
join me yeah please join you can work on

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:44,779
anything that you find interesting in a

00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:46,279
list we think that if you want to be on

00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:47,899
the membership working group it would be

00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:51,679
great if you have at least one day a

00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:55,899
month time because these things just

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:58,789
take time it will fizzle out if if you

00:25:55,899 --> 00:26:02,179
yeah don't reserve a little bit of time

00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:04,279
for it to get access of course to the

00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:07,010
membership register and so on you need

00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:09,139
to sign a nondisclosure agreement but

00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,600
you can also work on certain toppings

00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:16,279
larry's don't need access oh sorry

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:18,889
and we're over time and yeah just work

00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:20,809
out of your own initiative that will be

00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:23,120
great thanks

00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:26,630
do we have time for questions that's why

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,700
I stopped you just one second so I know

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,529
I don't I haven't forgotten about you

00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,210
don't worry don't worry no that's for

00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:34,039
later

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:37,820
so these guys have done an incredible

00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:39,710
job this year and that's important but I

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,539
think they need some help I think they

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,340
said some there's some technology issues

00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:46,789
there for a super smart community I

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,529
think that could help reading all of the

00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:51,200
fee waivers as board members we have to

00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:53,090
read all of those right and you guys did

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,500
that manually before so there's a lot of

00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,570
processes that you've documented which

00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,580
is really important so I always make a

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,679
plea to have people join my working

00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,899
groups if you can to help support but we

00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,340
have time for about two questions and

00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:09,039
then we're gonna do the group photo

00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:14,240
Oh Dermot you gonna make me run upstairs

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:16,309
well I promised aerobic just I'll be

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,529
quick about this one but it concerns

00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:20,360
that I suppose Michele you were saying

00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:22,429
talking about what it is that we think

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,020
membership is one of the questions that

00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:26,270
we often hear within the community is

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,799
why be a member and I think it's worth

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,270
reflecting Guillaume you gave us a very

00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,860
good answer to that because with a

00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,419
relatively small membership of the

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,299
foundation relative to the number of

00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:36,590
mappers it does leave these important

00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:39,370
decisions whether or not people choose

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:42,230
to join the foundation they are

00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:45,020
effectively bound by decisions made by

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,340
the foundation so the actual makeup of

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,370
the board and decisions that get made

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,710
within the board of the foundation the

00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,690
best way to resist this kind of

00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,159
manipulation is but it is by joining and

00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,870
I think it's probably just what everyone

00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:01,130
should have that as a take away of what

00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:03,409
we heard today absolutely it's the best

00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:08,960
defense as you said it's also important

00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:12,639
that we get broad representation to get

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,109
more good ideas and also be

00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:17,239
it's difficult when a small group takes

00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:18,919
decision that affects a lot of people so

00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:21,619
the more we are them the better it is

00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:24,109
yeah I plus 1 on the pleaded joint

00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:26,119
OpenStreetMap Foundation and to do that

00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:27,679
in a positive way but I also think we

00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:30,079
joined open source initiative this year

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,570
right there are other people who have

00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,820
open organizations who do membership so

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,139
what can we learn from them in terms of

00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,779
best practices and if we need to change

00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:40,339
our model that's really up to what a

00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:42,049
member is that's up to the membership

00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:44,149
working group to do it the board is

00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,589
taking recommendations from the working

00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:47,570
groups that's how the power dynamic

00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:48,859
works here so if you want to affect

00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,749
change that's got to be happening

00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:52,129
helping support these gentlemen that are

00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:54,529
working on it and other folks in the

00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:56,389
group one last question before we do

00:28:54,529 --> 00:29:06,019
photos I know you all want to take photo

00:28:56,389 --> 00:29:07,729
Simon very quick sign okay the question

00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:10,519
the questions click up in the word

00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:15,589
answers quick in the end after this

00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:19,489
incident do you have any idea what the

00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:21,379
motivation was and what they expected to

00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:23,749
achieve because that's the big mystery

00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:27,200
there doesn't really make sense as far

00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:29,419
as I can tell I would love to know I

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,749
I've kind of accepted I'm never gonna

00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:37,489
know Steve is still like oh oh dude what

00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:39,919
do you think talk to me outside if you

00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:41,479
have an idea I don't know if we should

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,639
do conspiracy theories but I would

00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,779
really like to do though is solve

00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:47,899
problems and I think you guys this

00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:50,599
process-oriented approach teaches us how

00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:54,200
we can actually prepare and plan and

00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:54,919
mitigate I think in the end it it

00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,289
doesn't matter

00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:01,700
what was behind it what matters is that

00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:04,909
it was detected and it was dealt with

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:07,339
and if you go to the Wikipedia page of

00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:09,559
global logic you're gonna see a section

00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:11,329
on OpenStreetMap and so it's really bad

00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:14,659
for your reputation to mess with

00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:16,600
OpenStreetMap don't do it honestly

00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:19,029
everyone's a member the

00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,529
be a good member is what I think that

00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:22,090
that's the summary I'd be good

00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:24,870
whoever you are a good member of

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,870
