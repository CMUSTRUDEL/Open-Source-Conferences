	00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:13,300
good morning everyone so I put up my

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,890
information

00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,760
I'll raise your hand if you're on the

00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,500
Fed averse on Mastodon or it's quite a

00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,180
few people who might want to check it

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,290
out it's a great way to communicate

00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:29,260
that's an alternative to Twitter so my

00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,419
name is Karen the one of the main things

00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:35,200
that you need to know about me is that I

00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:38,440
have a big heart I literally have a big

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,989
heart my heart is three times the size

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,300
of a normal person's heart it's extra

00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:47,739
thick actually it's called hypertrophic

00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,920
cardiomyopathy it's also obstructed and

00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:53,469
what that means is that I'm generally

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,039
fine I'm generally asymptomatic but I am

00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:58,629
at a very high risk of suddenly dying

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,530
don't worry I should see some highly

00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:04,300
alarmed faces and it is statistically

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:10,120
very improbable that I will die right

00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:12,130
now and so I you know it's it's yes I

00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,560
have a little joke somebody set us up

00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,140
the bomb about the fact that my heart

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,730
could I could could go into when the

00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:23,890
medical term is is actually called

00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:26,170
sudden death and it's all fine because I

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,880
when I found out about this it was

00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,520
coincidental to other medical issues

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,980
that I was having I had a heart murmur

00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,780
and so I went to the cardiologist and I

00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,360
also found out that I happen to have

00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,660
this condition and so finding out about

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,740
it in advance is is pretty great the

00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:47,670
electrophysiologists say no problem if

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,990
if you simply get a defibrillator you

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,640
you'll you'll be fine because you'll

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,390
have this device that's in your body

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,850
that will monitor your your heart rate

00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,460
and if you go into sudden death it will

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,930
shock you and you'll be fine and and

00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,710
this is wonderful technology and of

00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,170
course when I'm in the

00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,960
electrophysiologist office and he slides

00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,550
this over to me which they do they have

00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,250
all these devices in their desks and

00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,319
they they they give them to patients to

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,300
look at so that they see that it's a

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,420
small device that it's not so scary and

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,210
so he he looks at me expectantly you

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,250
know almost like isn't it cute and and

00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,010
of course what I say to him is what does

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,900
it run

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,549
right because of course I'm gonna put

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,549
this thing in my body and I want to know

00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:34,709
what is the software that is literally

00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:37,200
going to be sewn into my body and

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,040
connected to my heart and he said

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,040
software

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:48,080
and this began this long journey for me

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,270
of explaining to people in the medical

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,700
industry that there are you know that

00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,670
these devices operate due to software

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,300
what that means and why they should care

00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,780
about it

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,130
the thing that struck me is that my

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,500
electrophysiologist had implanted

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,540
thousands of these devices and he had

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,760
not considered the impact of the

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,220
technology that he was sowing into his

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,989
patients bodies nor did the

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,269
representatives from the device

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:16,280
manufacturers that were helping these

00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,620
doctors and that I talked to so of

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,110
course you know my first request was to

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,709
ask for the source code that did not go

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,989
very well as you might imagine but but

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:29,209
over time I realized that after years of

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:32,980
putting off getting the device because

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,880
it was so it freaked me out to have

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,640
technology in my body that I could

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,110
review I realized that that was pretty

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,190
silly because you really have to

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,480
prioritize your health a tip to anybody

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,100
in the audience if you're putting off a

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,930
medical condition because you think it's

00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,590
gonna be fine and you just don't want to

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,280
think about it

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,170
don't do that and so III took that

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,450
advice from from a friend of mine who

00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,180
who I had brunch with and she started

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,650
crying and she said you know how can you

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,880
be putting off this device because you

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,980
can't see the source code that is

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,900
absolutely ridiculous if you're gonna

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,850
you're gonna die because you you're

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,010
putting this up anyway so I said she was

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,600
right and I decided that what I needed

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,810
to do was to get the device but to

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,510
launch a research project on the safety

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,579
and efficacy of these devices and what I

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,320
found will not surprise anybody here in

00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:25,520
this room which is that software has

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,560
bugs the the software engineering

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,010
Institute estimates that for every one

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,280
for every 100 lines of code one bug is

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,139
introduced which even if you catch the

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:41,150
vast majority of bugs in most software

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:44,330
that's still a lot of bugs I also found

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,250
out about how how vulnerable all of our

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,440
devices are and I tell you while I

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,479
started doing all this research I kept

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,350
having to put it away and take a break

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,380
from it because it was so depressing

00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,000
as I found out how vulnerable all of

00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,740
these devices are especially medical

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,930
devices that are being implanted in

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:08,690
people's bodies so and and so what I

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:13,440
what I I loved was about some of these

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:15,960
vulnerabilities is that is is that so

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,310
this I was just looking at a medical

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,310
device vulnerabilities they also looked

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,620
at some other exploits and and

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,710
especially from white hat hackers and I

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,400
loved this study in particular because

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,080
it's a it's a it's a car hack and as you

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,490
can see this is like a car dashboard and

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,650
people are smiling because you're

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,780
probably seeing the the notice on the

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:40,140
dashboard which says that it's been

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,510
poned which is cool but you may not have

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,360
already noticed that it thinks it's

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:49,950
going 140 miles per hour but it also

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,230
thinks it's in park so at the average

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,330
car the average luxury car has about 100

00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,430
million lines of code in it which means

00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,560
that if we look at the software

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,850
engineering Institute estimate that's

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:09,300
like 1 million defect that's a lot of

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:11,640
defects and so all of this made me I it

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,560
really was very eye-opening and what I

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,500
realized is that we have the worst of

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,850
both worlds in our in our medical

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,120
devices world and in our critical

00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:25,950
technology world we have a situation

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:27,780
where we are not putting we have very

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:32,010
poor security on a lot of these devices

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,990
as evidenced by all of the exploits the

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,230
colorful ones that have been made a lot

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:40,950
of press and it seems like every month

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:43,590
there's a new one and at the same time

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,930
we are four we've we've are critical

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,160
technology is proprietary I could not

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:52,380
have a Greek war with Christians talk

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,800
just just now where he talked about the

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,610
the the corporate interest and and you

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,050
know how the technology works out and so

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,780
and so for me looking at

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,430
all of this I I started working on a

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:10,389
paper and so I published that I was a

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:13,889
long time ago already in 2010 and I I

00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:16,690
published this paper focused on the

00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,789
transparency component of it on the that

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,280
just the the ability to review the

00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:23,500
source code because I felt like if I

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,020
couldn't review the code in my own body

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,690
how could I ever know it was safe and I

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,360
was really focused on this issue that we

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,830
needed third parties especially academic

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,229
institutions to be able to

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:39,490
systematically look at the software

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:43,479
that's being deployed and and and for me

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:46,150
this was this was really increased when

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:50,650
early on and having my defibrillator I

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:53,110
was at the gym on the rower and and I

00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:57,699
hadn't realized that my defibrillator

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:59,259
was was not precisely calibrated when I

00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,849
first got it what because you would

00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,560
never know you know you just rely on

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,020
your medical professional to do that and

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,960
and it was set a little too sensitively

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,819
and so I when I was on the rower it

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,279
thought that my heart rate was twice of

00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:16,330
what it was and so I got unnecessarily

00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:17,919
shocked and which you know which was

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,319
very unpleasant but luckily if you're on

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,340
a rower you're sitting down so so that

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,810
was pretty good and and ultimately it

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,659
sort of brought all these things

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:32,200
together for me and and I realized that

00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:34,539
I realized that this issue was something

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,390
that that I wasn't passionate about and

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,010
I needed to be able to see myself how

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,510
the device was calibrated in order for

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,969
me to take ownership of my own situation

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,360
because I know my life the best I know

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:48,940
you know what happens to me at the gym

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,300
and so for me I published this paper

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,800
that was really focused on why free and

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,470
open source software was important from

00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,649
a transparency perspective but then I

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,360
continued to live was my device so this

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:05,920
is a picture of me almost nine months

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,680
pregnant and and when I was pregnant so

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,680
this is many years later after I first

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,260
got my device and the initial shock and

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,000
when I was pregnant about

00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,180
how much you described knows about

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,790
pregnancy but there are about 25% so

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,640
about 1/4 some people say 1/2 of all

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,310
pregnant women have heart palpitations

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,380
it's like a very common like I see a lot

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,450
of people money here okay so it's a very

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,920
very common symptom when you're when

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,630
you're pregnant it's the stress of the

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,990
body and there's palpitations it's not a

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:41,570
big deal but and if you're if you have a

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,890
normal health situation and you go to

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,990
the doctor and you're pregnant and you

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,300
say my heart I feel my heart's beating

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,310
weird they'll say oh don't worry that's

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,290
normal that's palpitations if they don't

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,910
resolve themselves quickly let me know

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,360
and we'll talk about it we'll see if we

00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,740
need anything to do for that but for me

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,160
because I had a defibrillator

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,110
my heart my defibrillator thought that

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,640
my heart was in a dangerous rhythm and

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,830
it thought that I was in sudden death

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:13,870
and so it shocked me unnecessarily twice

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:16,160
just for being pregnant basically and

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:19,190
this was very upsetting as you might

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:23,360
imagine very distressing and when I went

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:26,360
to my cardiologists about it what they

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,030
said was this is no problem because what

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,310
we'll do is we'll just increase your

00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,410
heart medication so I'm on this

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,690
preventative heart medication every time

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,120
I heartbeat it like damage is itself a

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,130
little bit and so I'm on this amount of

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,440
drug that just keeps it keeps my heart

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,150
rate a little bit slower and so to solve

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,750
this problem they said we're just gonna

00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:49,430
more than double this medication so that

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,740
your heart will beat so slowly that this

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,270
won't be a problem which meant that it

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,060
was very difficult for me to even climb

00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:58,580
up a flight of stairs so it was like a

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,110
very dramatic and the drug was safe for

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,050
fetuses this one of the drugs that's

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:06,680
used widely for a number of of

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:10,400
conditions so that part was safe but a

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:14,080
dawned on me that I was getting this

00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:17,390
huge amount of drugs simply to prevent

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,930
my device from giving the unnecessary

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:23,600
treatment so to prevent my life-saving

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,790
device from harming me I had to take all

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,870
these drugs I

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:30,370
need it was pretty weird and I thought

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,280
this can't be right

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,550
how can this possibly be right and then

00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:39,550
I did some research and I found out that

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:43,270
of all the people who get pacemaker

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:47,710
defibrillators only 15% are under the

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:50,230
age of 65 of all the people who get

00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:54,040
pacemaker defibrillators only 40% are

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:57,000
women so the set of people so so the

00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,830
number of women that could be pregnant

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,420
that have defibrillators is tiny the

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,700
number the set of women who are pregnant

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,400
with defibrillators is absolutely tiny

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,190
and then on top of that being pregnant

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,680
as a temporary condition right only a

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:15,790
quarter maybe of women have palpitations

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:19,140
so my use case simply wasn't a use case

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:23,320
that was anticipated by the manufacturer

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,630
these device manufacturers do not want

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,460
pregnant ladies getting shocked

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:30,400
unnecessarily that is literally the last

00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,900
thing they want what terrible press Plus

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,380
also I think everyone in the medical

00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,030
industry

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,420
nobody wants pregnant ladies getting

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,910
shocked that's pretty bad but but

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,250
because they hadn't thought about my use

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,470
case they hadn't anticipated how I might

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,020
be using the technology there was this

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,290
you know it fell through the cracks

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:53,170
now this only became an issue during the

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,100
end of my pregnancy right eventually I

00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,390
had the baby

00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,310
everything was fine I had the baby I had

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,080
the baby and and then I went back to my

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:07,630
normal state and this wasn't an issue

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:10,600
for me right but it was so poignant for

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:15,130
me to realize that through no ill will

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,440
of anyone my situation wasn't the

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:22,450
situation that the manufacturer had in

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,070
mind I was an edge case I also realized

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:27,760
that my current defibrillator

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,740
lasts for 17 years potentially they

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,570
they're very the sales rep is very

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,600
enthusiastic about the battery life was

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:37,150
a device that I have now and I think

00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,550
about what could happen and I just got

00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,860
it

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,840
two years ago so what could happen in

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,640
the next 15 years that wasn't

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,940
anticipated if if they had anticipated

00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,620
me being pregnant right what else could

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,230
there be that I'm going to encounter

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,180
that hasn't been anticipated and as we

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,340
live with all of these devices and we

00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,360
integrate them into our lives in

00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,520
different ways

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:03,260
what will the implications of that be

00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:06,440
you know and so it's it's it's it really

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,780
was very eye-opening for me because it

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,030
made me realize that even with the best

00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:14,080
of intentions there's a mismatch between

00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:17,300
what we're using our technology for and

00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,300
you know and and what it's been designed

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,130
for and what we can expect down the road

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,680
this is going to have all kinds of

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:27,320
implications as our software is in

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,910
everything this is a slide that that

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,980
just refers to a study about how

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:35,000
self-driving cars are more likely to run

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:38,000
you over if you are black the one of

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,610
them and so so where our software is

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,430
life and death it's it's obvious that

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,370
these issues are incredibly important

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:49,940
and and we need to anticipate all of all

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:53,360
of these different implications and so I

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:56,840
don't know if people have seen this that

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,750
these is a picture of a soap dispenser

00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,550
and I first encountered this on social

00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:05,540
media where there are these viral videos

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:07,160
where you can see of of people trying to

00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,880
use soap dispensers and what amazes me

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,250
is that it's not just one manufacturer

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,390
it's several brands of soap dispensers

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:21,620
and what happens is you'll see a person

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:23,600
with a light skin puts their hand under

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,070
the soap dispenser and soap comes out as

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,520
expected they wash their hands it's

00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,680
great

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,600
and then someone with dark skin puts

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,970
their hand under the soap dispenser and

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:37,010
nothing happens and they wave it around

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,990
nothing happens they take a white paper

00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,310
towel and they put it on top over their

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,880
hand and suddenly the soap dispenser

00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:45,620
works this is another example where the

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,870
people who made this soap dispenser

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,310
clearly wanted everyone to be able to

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:54,199
get soap right they wanted everyone to

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:57,269
clean hands but it's also obvious that

00:15:54,199 --> 00:16:00,230
they clearly didn't have anybody testing

00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:02,519
the device who had dark skin like

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,930
otherwise they would have caught this

00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:08,910
fundamental problem with their

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:11,189
technology right away so I you know this

00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,470
stands for all kinds of interesting

00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:16,649
propositions but our our technology must

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,600
be inclusive right we must have everyone

00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,639
involved in making our technology or

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,220
otherwise we're gonna miss really

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,670
important really big things we can't

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,709
simply rely on a few companies to make

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,079
the technology that we rely on and

00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:33,059
expect them to get this right it's too

00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:35,519
important but also it doesn't

00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:38,249
necessarily aligned with their profit

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,100
motives they're necessarily looking for

00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:42,660
their quarterly interests and again as

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,579
Christian said there's nothing wrong

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,170
with that that's it we have a lot of

00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,180
useful technology a lot of useful

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,920
products from the private sector but we

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,720
simply cannot leave it solely to the

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,519
private sector because they're gonna

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,480
miss big things like this that we as a

00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:01,079
public can consult so these experiences

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,970
made me realize that I cared so much

00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:05,220
more about the technology we rely on

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,630
than I ever jumped that I would I mean I

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,149
went to engineering school and then went

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,280
to law school I then became a securities

00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:13,980
lawyer I was working on like stocks and

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,110
bonds I was never particularly public

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,240
interest focused but having this

00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,610
experience with meeting a medical device

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,230
and realizing that it's not just you

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:25,620
know it's very eye-opening to realize

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:27,539
that your life relies on this software

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,130
on this piece of technology and then

00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:31,380
when you bring all of it together and

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,360
you realize all the other software that

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,669
you're relying on and how it's

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,559
impossible to know right where we live

00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:41,309
in an Internet of Things we're only as

00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:44,490
safe as our weakest link and so you know

00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:45,090
realizing that all of our software talks

00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,830
to each other

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,980
and how vulnerable that is it made me

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:52,260
realize that I had to step it up and so

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,059
I am now executive director of the

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,710
software freedom Conservancy and we're

00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,840
dedicated to raise your hand if you've

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,360
heard of software freedom Conservancy so

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,080
it's about like like 1/8 of the audience

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,289
that's cool so we're

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,809
do a whole bunch of things we're we're

00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:11,690
physical sponsors so we're the nonprofit

00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,210
home for for dozens of free software

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:17,690
projects stuff you're probably using

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,679
I'll just say maybe get but but lots of

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,220
other stuff too

00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,740
as you can see from all of these logos

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:28,399
and and we're dedicated to supporting

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,769
these free and open alternatives to

00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:34,220
proprietary software we also run

00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:37,340
outreaching which has been active in a

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,779
osm community hot has participated in

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,389
our eg before raise your hand if you've

00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:45,260
heard about Ricci so that's like raise

00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:49,190
your hand if you have been a mentor or

00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:52,399
participant in our reaching like two or

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:55,730
three people awesome out Ricci is a

00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:58,309
diversity initiative we do remote paid

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,889
internships for people who are subject

00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:03,200
to systemic bias or were impacted by

00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,429
under-representation attack and so we

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,809
have like these 3-month internships

00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:08,510
razor hand if you've heard of google

00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:10,010
Summer of Code that's like okay that's

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,710
like three-quarters of the audience so

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,539
so outreach he is inspired by google

00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,190
Summer of Code in fact it was started by

00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:18,769
originally by the kinome community

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,649
because they had 181 applicants one year

00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:24,590
to google Summer of Code and and only

00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:26,090
one of them was a woman and so they

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,799
realized that they do something about it

00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,529
so it's it's formed sort of very

00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:32,240
similarly to Summer of Code but it's

00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:34,100
again for people who are who are

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,039
subjected to systemic bias and are

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:40,179
impacted by it and so and so we pair up

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,200
free software communities with with

00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,029
participants and match them up with some

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,789
mentors and have them contribute it's

00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:48,830
been pretty cool about well 600 people

00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,690
now have come through the program and

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,649
it's been really successful people who

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,179
have come through the program have

00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,529
become leaders it's it's it's pretty

00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:58,100
good it's one of the things I'm most

00:19:54,529 --> 00:20:02,269
proud of that Conservancy does and then

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,070
Conservancy also is we we also are

00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:06,169
involved in the ideological side of

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:09,440
software freedom and to sort of help

00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:12,049
promote the ethical component of a free

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,970
and open-source software there was this

00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:18,160
study also from 2010 that I read about

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,020
the honeymoon effect I love pulling the

00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,040
audience so I'm sorry but raise your

00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,970
hand if you've heard of the honeymoon

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,590
effect so just like to two people

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:29,560
so the honeymoon effect it's a security

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:34,210
paper and in this paper they didn't they

00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:36,400
looked at at the vulnerabilities and

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,320
exploits in software projects they

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,780
looked at proprietary systems and they

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,490
looked at a free and open source

00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,100
software free and open source software

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,840
systems as well I I put drinks the

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,800
drinks on a beach that really doesn't

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,050
have anything to do with the actual

00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,020
honeymoon effect but we wish we wish it

00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:54,460
did but with so so they look if you look

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,740
at the number of bugs and a software

00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,880
project over time you'll see that as you

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,160
would expect the number of bugs

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,770
decreases as the project becomes more

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,170
mature people fix more of the problems

00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:08,320
that are known in the project but for

00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:11,500
systems that are smooth but if you look

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,150
at at vulnerabilities instead of the

00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,340
number of bugs you'll see something very

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,260
surprising or at least it was surprising

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,840
to these researchers and until this

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,130
paper was published which is that there

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,810
is this there's what they call the

00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,210
honeymoon period so there's a period of

00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:28,000
time when there are no known

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,550
vulnerabilities and so that's the flat

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,900
part of the curve right and then and so

00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,120
there's some amount of time and it

00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,140
varies and the researchers postulate

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,560
that it could be for a lot of different

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:41,440
reasons possibly social reasons but once

00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,900
there is a vulnerability it increases at

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,230
an almost exponential rate and what this

00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,610
tells me is that it's not necessarily

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,410
today when your project when your

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,510
product first launches or your project

00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,760
first gets published that you have to

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,460
worry about the security of your project

00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:01,240
it's at some point down the road that

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:05,410
you have to worry and this is just an

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,900
amazing lesson because when you first

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:11,470
launch a product at a company of another

00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,210
Pole raise your hand if you are here

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:17,800
because you're working and something

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:19,270
related to OSM wow it's like half more

00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,250
than it's like two thirds of the

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,900
audience I would say raise your hand if

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,820
you're a hobbyist

00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,880
and that's overlapping and I would say

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,860
it's about a third yeah and raise your

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:38,810
hand raise your hand if this is your

00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:40,400
first conference like almost a third of

00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:43,610
the audience that's really really cool

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,710
and so what this damn this whole

00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,720
proposition stands for is that it's not

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,190
just when you're so almost everybody

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,880
here is working professionally in this

00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:54,110
in this in technology it's it's not when

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,880
you first come to market that you have

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,190
to worry about security it's down the

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,800
road it's when your relationships with

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,770
your vendors are you know who knows

00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,330
right it's when the people who

00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,580
originally worked on the product no

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:10,250
longer are at the company right it's

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:13,190
when things aren't fresh it's down the

00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:16,400
road and it tells me that we not only

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:18,890
need to have access to our source code

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,170
today but we need to have access to it

00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,850
well down the road we have access to all

00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,620
our technology when we may not even know

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,350
what's going to be happening again like

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,690
with my defibrillator and most

00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:32,360
importantly we need to be able to have

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,240
the software to control the other

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,980
scripts to control installation because

00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,770
we need to make sure that when our

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,440
products are vulnerable we have control

00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,090
over them and we can replace the

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,580
software and have control of our own

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,470
destiny so that this device that is in

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,360
sitting in my body doesn't just have to

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,680
be replaced because it needs because it

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,830
needs an update and I can't get an

00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,690
update because my my device manufacturer

00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,980
went out of business ten years ago right

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,080
and nobody knows where any of that

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,560
source code goes and this is sort of it

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,360
now if anyone here is legally focused

00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,000
they may have noticed that my reference

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,320
to scripts to control installation is a

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,920
reference to text in the GPL raise your

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,220
hand if you have no idea what the GPL is

00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:21,260
like wow so like yeah that's cool so and

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,690
that's awesome so that's like an eighth

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:27,379
of the audience so the GPL is a

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:29,720
the can you general public license it's

00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:31,460
a it's a sharing license it's a license

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,710
that says you can do whatever you want

00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,179
with the software but if you make

00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,610
changes and distribute those changes

00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:39,529
this is a vast oversimplification you

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,480
must do so under this very same license

00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:44,860
its share alike as we would call it in

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,049
the OSM community in concept or copyleft

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:50,389
and so originally I was focused on

00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:52,340
transparency I thought we just needed to

00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:54,289
be able to see the technology then I

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:57,409
realized no we need to be able to

00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:59,710
control it right and I realized that I

00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:02,629
went from someone who thought that it

00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,919
didn't matter what the licenses were it

00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:06,799
didn't matter if it were permissive or

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,389
copyleft it just matters that we we

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,450
would have access to it and now I

00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:14,179
realized that as we wrap all of our

00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:16,129
software in you know in in other

00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,590
software it matters that we actually

00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:21,320
have control and so all of this is to

00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,120
say I tried to be a purist right I

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,440
wanted to use as much free and open

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,059
source software as possible and no

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,679
proprietary software raise your hand if

00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:30,139
you also have tried to be a purist at

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,440
some times in your life it's like also

00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:35,929
like 1/8 of the audience once upon a

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,360
time this was like super easy to do

00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:41,659
right we had so much control over our

00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,700
technology I had one of these raise your

00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:46,429
hand if you had one of these like half

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,679
the audience that almost it was really

00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:50,509
easy to replace the software it was easy

00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:53,299
to know what software you were running

00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:55,549
and and and have control over it and

00:25:53,299 --> 00:26:00,919
then things get more complicated this is

00:25:55,549 --> 00:26:04,039
the g1 phone the for one of the first

00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,539
smartphones that Google put out and the

00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:08,690
way that people started to use their

00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:11,389
software started to change immensely the

00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,509
web changed right this is a picture of a

00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:17,570
screenshot from conservancies Bank and

00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:19,809
if you have Java scripts turned off and

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:24,409
you don't want to be tracked you cannot

00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:26,720
do anything so you cannot basically you

00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:28,700
cannot live in the current world and not

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,289
use some proprietary software and I keep

00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,049
knitting up against this over and over

00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:34,429
again you can't book a flight you could

00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,240
use your rent but you have to go every

00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:36,470
time you

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,270
a transaction you would have to walk

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,220
over to the bank and even that is

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,640
becoming harder and harder as people are

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:45,620
used to combine banking and so we're in

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,570
this situation where if you're living in

00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:53,090
the you know if you're doing things for

00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:55,700
yourself you cannot you cannot use only

00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,540
free free software and I try to use free

00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,679
software because I think it's important

00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,790
it's important because I want to I don't

00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,750
I don't want to have to rely on

00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,520
proprietary software

00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,050
I don't want software I can't look at

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,330
like the software in my body right I

00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:10,100
don't want software that could be

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,720
surveilling me that I don't know about I

00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,610
don't want software that could be doing

00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,110
any variety that could have you know

00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,570
deals with third parties I don't want

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,429
any of that and at the same time I do it

00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,260
to make a point right I do it so that

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,510
anyone who wants to talk to me with

00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,550
proprietary platforms or who wants me to

00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,050
send them a docx file have to think

00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,640
about it for a second like to think

00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,530
about the software that you're using and

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,530
by having my personal influence in

00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:36,559
society means that there's this positive

00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,520
effect of just avoiding free software

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,200
right I mean I'm sorry - avoiding

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,790
proprietary software and only using free

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,160
software that there's like just a

00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:45,050
follow-on effect but there's a real

00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,910
hip-hopper stay in it right and there's

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:49,130
a hypocrisy that those of us who have

00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:52,250
been trying to be purists because often

00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,960
it means that we push the proprietary

00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,580
software you some other people we

00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,010
stopped thinking and stuck worrying

00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,470
about the servers and and other stuff

00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:03,140
and that that was really a problem and

00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,670
what of what we found is that people

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,450
kept saying open-source as one

00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:10,309
open-source is one right and we have

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,010
more free and open-source software than

00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:15,050
ever before but we have less actual

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:17,179
freedom than ever before we have less

00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:19,070
control over our devices and in the end

00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:21,559
it's not about transparency it's

00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:24,260
actually about that control the most

00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:29,710
poignant problem for me and trying to

00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:33,260
avoid proprietary software was mapping

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:35,360
so this is what you get if you try to

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,640
use Google Maps and you have proprietary

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,580
JavaScript switched off or JavaScript

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,650
switched off which I just amazes me that

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,840
that

00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,370
we could have this you know when you

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,280
have eliminated the JavaScript whatever

00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:52,150
remains must be an empty page it's just

00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:54,340
it's it's amazing so for so long to stay

00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,230
pure this is me

00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,180
this is a picture of me my navigation

00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,710
techniques along with friends and he was

00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,720
using this proprietary tablet to

00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:04,210
navigate and I was of course using a

00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,040
paper map this very night that I took

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:09,000
this picture I was walking around with a

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:14,080
paper map in that city and it rained and

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,670
my mouth got soggy and I was not I got

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,440
totally lost and what should have been a

00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:20,680
ten minute walk took me an hour and a

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,310
half and I was an hour late to a meet to

00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:26,470
a dinner which was really really sad but

00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,870
the worst part about it was that there

00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:31,480
was a time when my father had there was

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:35,800
an incident with my father and and he

00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:37,240
was and he was in the hospital and I got

00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,390
a phone from a phone call from my mother

00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,740
and she said I don't know what's

00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,360
happening but I don't think there's a

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,640
lot of time can you get here

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,310
and I said absolutely I live in a city

00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,990
where I don't own a car but there are

00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:52,840
parts airing services it was the middle

00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:56,230
of the night I rented a car I got in the

00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:00,310
car and I said oh no I don't know

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:03,880
exactly where the hospital is am I gonna

00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:07,560
miss my father dying because I won't use

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,910
proprietary software it was this

00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,470
horrible poignant moment where I

00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,600
realized am I making the right

00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,820
compromises is it right not to use

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,560
proprietary software when should we and

00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,860
when shouldn't we and it was so

00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:23,950
upsetting and it was I did make it there

00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,720
in time I didn't make any wrong turns

00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,940
actually which is fairly miraculous

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,320
because I'm terrible with directions but

00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,360
I don't doesn't matter that I'm so bad

00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,850
at directions because I cannot tell you

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,880
the joy the joy that I experienced when

00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:40,270
I understood where OSN is at and where

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,940
Osmond is when I realized how good it is

00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:45,520
and more recently and and it started

00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,580
using it the joy that I felt is as

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,200
intensely positive as

00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,600
pain I felt in that moment and the

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,760
helplessness that I felt and so I wanted

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,250
to say that's huge thank you to the OSM

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,130
community because you have done so much

00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,990
to make it possible that to make freedom

00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:03,570
possible and to make real ownership of

00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,420
our technology possible and so keep

00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:09,830
being so awesome

00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,830
thank you thank you so much

00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:21,820
you are the community that is giving me

00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:24,100
hope Oh SM can unravel the dystopia that

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,780
we are already living in and so please

00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,980
help make small choices that support

00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:30,010
software freedom and your own personal

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:32,590
usage but make big choices Oh SM is on

00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:34,420
this in this inflection point right the

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,820
companies that are involved have their

00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,890
own interests we can say strong as a

00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,090
community so that we leverage their

00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,650
interest so they can still have

00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,750
productive businesses but on our terms

00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:46,210
and our communities terms and on the

00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,610
public terms help shine light on the

00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,230
problem so that everyone understands

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,420
that these issues are on control over

00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:56,290
our technology aren't so important to us

00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:58,480
and thank you so much help support free

00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:01,300
software charities and an ethical

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,190
charities like Conservancy but also like

00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,120
the foundations in the OSM community

00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,120
thank you so much

00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:15,990
we've got country we've got time for

00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:18,690
questions I think maybe wanna say thank

00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,640
you very much Karen and lot to you here

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:23,010
whether you're here for your job or your

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,179
hobby it's great knowing that affects

00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:29,700
lives what we're doing and so much so

00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,679
yeah I want we're here for discussion as

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,720
well so I want allow people to ask

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,309
questions

00:32:32,720 --> 00:33:01,490
brilliant and raise your hand if you've

00:32:35,309 --> 00:33:05,910
got a question who had a question oh

00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:09,299
it's you if you want okay thank you very

00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:12,690
much Karen for a highly insightful story

00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:14,580
and also a very personal story I have a

00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,549
question actually two questions related

00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:20,940
to that and they may easily be mistaken

00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:23,190
for it nor the teaser question and I

00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:27,270
don't mean it that way I mean something

00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:31,230
that really you know asked something for

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:33,960
the next 50 or 80 years I I would

00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:38,030
postulate that your body has much more

00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,030
code in it than only in your implant

00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:48,809
right and you know that software was

00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:54,059
made by a two-person developer team with

00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:58,140
no formal education and it has a lot of

00:33:54,059 --> 00:34:00,110
bugs and effects so clearly one question

00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,150
is aren't you bothered with that also

00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:06,510
the second question and the second

00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:11,090
question is is that is that actually

00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:14,879
free software or is it proprietary and

00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:18,899
what do you think about 50 years from

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,629
now we'll be able to write software not

00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:23,419
in code lines but with you know the

00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:27,099
genetic techniques

00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:29,629
to do something about that yeah I mean

00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:32,000
these are all complicated questions you

00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:34,909
know like I want all of our software to

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,059
be free and open in a real way for

00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:39,349
forever I mean I think that it's the

00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:41,269
only way that we're gonna be able to

00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:43,399
really have truly safe software in the

00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:47,299
long run software is embedded in our

00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:50,359
body in a whole host of ways and I think

00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:54,679
without having that any any review over

00:34:50,359 --> 00:35:04,630
it is it's pretty pretty bad I would say

00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:04,630
that I would say that the the fact that

00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:10,160
I'm trying it was such a big question

00:35:06,799 --> 00:35:11,269
and had so many parts to it and I a lot

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,720
actually just lost my train of thought

00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:13,720
I'm sorry

00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:24,529
somebody put the software in the way so

00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:27,049
please per front rate what we made oh

00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:28,490
yeah I mean so we have the ability to

00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:30,019
study it and this is sort of a trick

00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:31,880
since what I want to say is that is that

00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:33,200
is that this is where at least in the

00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,519
u.s. we've had these really interested

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,930
in and in Europe as well these

00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:39,079
interesting patent fights and I have to

00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:42,200
say thank you Europe for imposing

00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,690
rational policies that now we Americans

00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,119
are benefiting from but the patent

00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,759
situation is particularly bad because it

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,980
has in the past sort of conflated these

00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:53,930
areas where what is naturally our body

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,940
is then protectable intellectual

00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,740
property and so there's been a lot of

00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,089
really solid fighting against that and I

00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,180
think the laws are moving in the right

00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:04,569
way to help us and so I think the main

00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,339
thing is is that we we just need to oh

00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:09,049
and then we need to be understand that

00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:12,769
all software is vulnerable whether its

00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:15,799
proprietary or or or free and open and

00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:18,200
there are there's a project called open

00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:21,650
APs which is an artificial pancreas

00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:24,710
project and what they do is they exploit

00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:26,930
a vulnerability in a in a insulin pump

00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,549
and they and they use that in order to

00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,269
deliver themselves a closed-loop system

00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:33,099
and so and so it's it's really really

00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:35,079
take stuff and it's only they're only

00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:36,579
able to help themselves because there is

00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:38,559
the security vulnerabilities so it's

00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:40,689
pretty weird the whole situation is

00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,399
extremely complicated and I think we're

00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:44,529
going to see a lot of a lot of

00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:47,799
development in that area as we go I

00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:50,169
think that our body is just as as we're

00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:53,049
mapping what we see around us our bodies

00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:55,299
must whatever is observable must be we

00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:58,119
must protect that information and in the

00:36:55,299 --> 00:37:00,669
interest of the public they will just

00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,279
squeeze this question I'm here is there

00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:06,309
any sort of communication between the

00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:08,949
device manufacturers to get devices to

00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:12,009
communicate so for example somebody with

00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:14,799
a pacemaker and an insulin pump could

00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:17,199
have them communicate and work out which

00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:19,839
one is actually going or whether they

00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,419
can work together and if there is such

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,509
an a communication between manufacturers

00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:29,499
could the route didn't start are the

00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:31,089
artificial pancreas people be used to

00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:34,119
start to crack open the rest of the

00:37:31,089 --> 00:37:37,539
medical device system so I mentioned

00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:39,609
that because it's pretty great because

00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:41,499
it's a patient's taking control and that

00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:43,239
they're basically taking control of the

00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:45,159
pumps that are in their bodies so these

00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:47,889
devices are all talking to all kinds of

00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:49,929
things so so if you have a defibrillator

00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:51,939
many people have this like black box

00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:53,409
that sits on their night table and it

00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:57,429
communicates with their defibrillator

00:37:53,409 --> 00:38:00,039
and that's handy for people who are not

00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:01,899
like me who have me need to rely on

00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:03,759
their device a lot more for for

00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:05,709
treatment or go in more entire shape and

00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:07,149
so their information is sent to their

00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:09,039
doctors who can then monitor whether

00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:12,009
they have an issue or not those devices

00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,029
of st. Jude have had a brand of them and

00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:15,429
they were shown to be completely

00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:18,179
vulnerable and using those devices they

00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:21,519
were able to deliver a fatal shock to to

00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:23,889
to patients and so these devices all of

00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:25,239
them are built with with various

00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:28,299
connectivity and they're talking to all

00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:29,979
different kinds of things including now

00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:33,819
insulin pumps that talk to folks

00:38:29,979 --> 00:38:35,019
directly and so what I'm excited to see

00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:37,239
is we're seeing a lot more patient

00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:39,309
engagement as more technically savvy

00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:40,700
people are getting these devices we're

00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:42,950
all engaging and

00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,990
the device manufacturers are only now

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:47,300
starting to open up to the idea that

00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:51,400
they can work with us but I think it is

00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:54,560
happening so I am very optimistic oh

00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,300
thank you very much yeah

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,630
come talk to her she's around in the

00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,630
