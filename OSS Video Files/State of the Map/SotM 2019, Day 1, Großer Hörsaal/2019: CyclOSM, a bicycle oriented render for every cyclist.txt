Title: 2019: CyclOSM, a bicycle oriented render for every cyclist
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 1, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	CyclOSM is a new cycling render. It is free and aims at rendering new bicycle-specific features, in order to take into account the diversity of cycling practices.

CyclOSM is a new cycling render. It is free and aims at rendering more features than OpenCycleMap, in order to take into account the diversity of cycling practices.

For urban bikers (bike commuting), we decided to render all available types of cycle tracks and lanes, in a lateralized manner, as well as key POIs such as bicycle parkings, parkings shared with motorbikes, specific bike features (elevators / ramps), speed limitations, and surfaces of the highways to avoid paving stones.

For bicycle tourers, we also rendered bicycle touring routes as well as a set of essential POIs (emergency services, shelters, tourism, shops) as wel las elevation data to help you design your bike journey.

Building on the excellent quality of the OpenStreetMap data in Paris, we are also in touch with some local bicycle organizations to gather feedback and help them have a quick and detailed view of the current state of the cycling road infrastructure in the city. As such, a particular emphasis has been put on well rendering the quality of the infrastructures (clearly differentiating bidirectional cycle ways, dedicated lanes versus shared with public transport, etc) as well as some new elements which were not previously rendered: bike boxes and bumps.

Designing a map render for every cyclist is a challenging task: bike infrastructures are usually parcimonious and very tightly bound to the road network, which makes bike-first visualizations not as readable as wished. There are also a wide variety of cyclist profiles, each requiring slightly different emphasis. CyclOSM is our attempt at tackling this challenge. In this talk, we will briefly sum up the main rendered features as well as discuss the design decisions and the difficulties of bicycle-oriented rendering. This talk will also provide a basic "getting started" summary, to help you start contributing and hacking this new render.

A demo is already available at https://cyclosm.github.io/cyclosm-cartocss-style/example.html (limited to a few French cities at the moment, soon extended). The CyclOSM render is also available on the MapOSMatic instance https://maposmatic.osm-baustelle.de/. All contributions (issues, enhancements ideas or actual code through pull requests) are welcome at https://github.com/cyclosm/cyclosm-cartocss-style/ !

	00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,330
so we are here today to present you the

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,789
cycle OSM

00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,279
which aims at providing a bicycle

00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:21,610
oriented render for each and every

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,130
cyclist no matters a kind of practice

00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:28,640
whether it's mountain biking in the city

00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:33,140
or whether you are like sports guy

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:38,090
so I'm new Coveney known as fix on OS m

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:40,719
online and I'm working on this with

00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,719
problem

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,310
hello yes thank you guys it's employment

00:00:52,470 --> 00:01:00,150
we are both very young and we both sexes

00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:05,309
in everyday life we do also to Reserve

00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:08,240
on bicycles and sport and I'm completely

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:14,119
contributing to open sea path since I

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,119
cycle in Paris so since two years only

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,130
for first of all why do we need a

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,090
bicycle map and why is it different than

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,850
regular math so most math let's look at

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,880
this business map on the left are made

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,390
with Motor Vehicles in mind so they show

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,050
the main roads and you're designed with

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,690
like a real car approach whether

00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:42,570
cyclists actually wants safe

00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:46,560
uncomfortable way and is mostly okay for

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:51,149
a small detour in order to safer or more

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,229
comfortable routes needed in different

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,770
situations

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,890
be it for everyday life in the city for

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:04,650
sports or outside of the city for

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:09,869
touring or mountain bike so we are aware

00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:11,970
of a few few existing render so the most

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,299
known one is probably open cycle map

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:17,970
which is featured on OS m dot org there

00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:20,459
are also local approaches we are aware

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:25,320
of which were run by associations but

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:27,209
only on the local scale and this is in

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,030
an interesting subject because Open

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:33,989
Street Map is a reference data source

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,760
for bicycle so especially were coming

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,040
from Paris and are there is a lot of

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,430
activity built from correct ivities or

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,810
associations to complete the map so it's

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:49,380
in our place it's probably one of the

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:52,560
observer reference data source so why

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:56,130
would we need another one so first of

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,130
all some of the previous approaches I

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,900
local scale so if you're building with a

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,450
lot of implicit knowledge on the

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,510
situation on the specific city where

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,900
they are in or specific area and for a

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:14,370
specific kind of cyclist as well for

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,410
instance urban commuters also rely on

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,930
technologies which is like overpass

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,840
queries and a flat layers and so on so

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:26,730
it's not widely used ever on any kind of

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:29,670
device so the only one we know which is

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,410
fitted for the four planets fulfills the

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,240
requirements of having tires and being

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,650
reusable and so on is open cycle map

00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,310
certainly it's it's not a free software

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:44,010
so contribution is difficult there are

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,110
some known issues on like really

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,870
contributes because it's it's not free

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,570
software so for instance our shared bus

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,090
lanes on the contour floor lanes which

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,720
are very common in some some places are

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,440
not rendered and also it targets the

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,530
general public with an easy to read key

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,310
but the key can be quite confusing for

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,560
newcomers

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:18,989
for instance tracks are shown as dotted

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:21,239
instead of solid so we aim at having a

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:23,790
render for each and every cyclist in any

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,490
situation beat in Europe an area where

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,500
we will focus on the main your eyes and

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,750
the infrastructure interesting for

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,850
commuting or going to do shopping and

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,060
seeing friends and whatever in rural

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,640
area we target as well like tourism so

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,530
we have the cycle routes and all the

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,140
emergency points of interest on the

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,930
trees and points of interest and it's

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,130
also while we envision it as a tool as

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,230
well for the mappers and the

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,740
association's to have an overview of the

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:55,800
cycle infrastructure well with new new

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,400
elements rendered 12 maps the cycle

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,680
infrastructure so our few snapshots so

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,699
this is an urban area in Paris this is

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,620
how it renders

00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:13,599
and this is an example in rural area

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:15,969
France but we will detail it now so one

00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,909
of the biggest challenge we had to do

00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:22,090
that map is to is that we have many

00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:26,680
features that we wanted to run a added

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:30,240
map and here's the list of the features

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,729
and data we use of in OpenStreetMap and

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:38,009
so first is of course the type in the

00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:41,110
importance of different I we we we have

00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:45,430
sacrifice sexual which is the tractor

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:48,340
lane at the Shabbos lanes whether it is

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,430
one way or not on the road and whether

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:56,699
it is one way for recycled others the

00:05:51,430 --> 00:06:01,960
surface quality of the road because we

00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:04,060
decided there is actually when you write

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,080
back a world like you would not want to

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,389
go on a very under gravel track for

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,490
instance so we use a track type the

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:19,020
surface and stairs tags father we wanted

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:23,529
to show how many traffic dies on

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:27,069
different on different words so for that

00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:32,080
we are not much data so we use a warrior

00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:36,069
he and the speed limits for declivity in

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,439
relief we use a certain data that came

00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:42,969
from an essay anneza

00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:46,830
nation mission so for the type of

00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:51,460
traffic allowed we use a different

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,800
highway tag with pedestrian and doing

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:59,199
streets of course and also we use the

00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:07,139
access tagging the last things to run a

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:07,139
water cycling routes so now this next

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:18,590
okay so the first thing we use for

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:22,430
father Randolph is to use a color so we

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:25,099
decided that blue means bike it's bike

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:28,069
friendly so for instance a cycle way

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:40,550
we'd run during a full blue as we can

00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:45,229
see I don't know thank you

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,849
so that's gonna be difficult so that is

00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:51,199
the second right here just across the

00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:55,069
screen as you can see the green is for

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:59,240
player to the pedestrian so there is a

00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:02,030
food trailer park in the top left corner

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,460
of the image lots of foot twists our on

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:08,539
going green and when you have mixed

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:12,849
traffic between psych recycler and pedis

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:16,449
where we went out in a song close as you

00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:22,699
maybe you can see some paths in the wood

00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:27,199
the lower pathos image next we use also

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:30,469
the colors for traffic the quantity of

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:35,630
the traffic because we can say that the

00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:37,909
road with not much of traffic is

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:42,320
recycled friendly and pedestrian

00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:44,750
friendly so we decided that for car form

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,320
when a road have a back speed of 30

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:50,360
kilometers we run those in like blue

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,680
when it is 20 kilometers like in a

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,120
living street in France

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:59,370
we're under them in the

00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:02,370
like blue green color and when it is for

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:05,600
like a walk speed under 10 kilometers

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:12,389
we're under them in more green young

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:16,139
colors yeah and there's 40 access

00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:20,699
afterward when I rode is have to tag

00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:23,490
motor vehicle ago no it means as no

00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:25,920
vehicle in in it so it's very mystical

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:32,100
and very pedestrian friendly so we went

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:34,980
the same in that green color and we're

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:39,680
under all sorts of barriers with small

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,680
icons and you can see on the right image

00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:49,319
another important feature of the maps is

00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:51,930
the quality the quality of sacker way

00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:56,430
and the quality of the surface we

00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:59,309
decided to use three kind of line a

00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:03,300
solid line when the rise of a scratchy

00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:06,809
and dash line was when the Krejci go

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:12,689
down so solid line means a good secure

00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:15,340
way it's a coat rack story no more -

00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:19,610
shine is a second lane as you can see

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:24,149
[Music]

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:27,360
yeah thank you yeah and when the next

00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:29,699
train is faced that is the best line on

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,199
the other side of the road here yeah and

00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:37,170
we do the same thing for surfaces so

00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:40,319
when the road is a good surface we like

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:45,620
as fact you just use a solid color as

00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:49,220
you see and but when the world

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:53,089
a bad surface but not as bad we actually

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:56,510
we split the question of suffers in

00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:59,960
three kind of surface so first that okay

00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:02,900
for what like like as fact Sophia that's

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:07,310
okay for tricking or garbage like find

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:12,350
water and so fat that ok for mountain

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:17,140
bike like ground and I think that partly

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:22,460
off of just left I know major surface in

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:29,510
in the street yes just there we it was a

00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:32,720
sweet with a few dashed okay so type in

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:37,310
importance of highway the first thing we

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:40,550
do is that motorway are not run as

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:44,570
outrun not highlighted they just run in

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:48,230
gray main roads are grown of course but

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:51,980
not that are not bigger than Josh I rode

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:54,500
justified word for instance and of

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,170
course which was living strange and a

00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:03,830
pedestrian pedestrian street with little

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:08,029
white long bottles next directional

00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:11,990
traffic is made with simple errors great

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:14,570
error for vehicles blue arrows for peace

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:17,270
a cure for cotton flow be secure and we

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:22,430
draw also the one-way direction on the

00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:28,520
second track which is white error and

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:33,430
the last thing we do for so the routing

00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:36,220
the woods for passage be secure

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:41,110
that was a little challenge also because

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:43,540
we wanted to dance for level of roots

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,780
solo car which won our national

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:52,690
international routes and we wanted to do

00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:55,950
them or it was difficult to find good

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:59,320
colors that mix well when you stack them

00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:03,190
and was also difficult to stack them and

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:10,600
to be able to do so in fixed fixture and

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:14,500
other yes the last things are relief for

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:18,310
that we do two things sitting sitting

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:23,020
very useful with really user-friendly

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:25,030
because our planes are made to

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,090
understand the relief just with a shake

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:35,560
and if you want to be precise you can

00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:37,870
you have the control eyes and you can

00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:48,430
count the continents to to understand

00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:51,730
elevations time so here's an example to

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:56,170
show you the power of sake awesome that

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:59,320
is a wood in the west of Paris and let's

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:03,850
say that you live in a sauce in bologna

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:08,650
and you walk in and off in the year yeah

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:12,160
and you do that do that commuting with

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:15,010
the cycle of course and you would like

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,170
to avoid that main word in the middle of

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:21,000
the wood because I have caused a lot of

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,000
traffic on it

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:28,440
so as you can see is as many roll into

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:31,710
that good but you don't know which one

00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:36,480
open or closed for traffic it don't know

00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:39,570
the surface of that roads so you cannot

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,840
decide if it is better to go or to take

00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,770
the road on the east or to take a road

00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,700
on the west

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:51,300
I mean maybe it'll go in the middle but

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:54,930
if you switch to sack USM you can decide

00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,150
can decide because you see that there

00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,340
are many roads in that food that are

00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:05,100
closed to traffic that one in the

00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:10,770
ahamkara and forest and if you want you

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:13,050
to use the middle word yeah that one you

00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:17,610
can see it's not very clear that

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:21,930
protector but you can see as it is

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:24,360
patched it is rather with a dash line so

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:29,280
it means that the ground

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:35,070
the surface is a medic driver the road

00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:39,270
on the West is as a good surface that

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:41,480
you can take up to the nose yeah that

00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,480
way

00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:53,989
okay so we're under also quite new new

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,799
elements but to our knowledge are not

00:15:53,989 --> 00:16:00,379
rendered yet in other styles with the

00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,389
idea well it's kind of drugs are under

00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:04,339
two tags so the idea that these elements

00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:07,569
might already be added in

00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:10,399
osm database but then they are like

00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:12,949
often not maintained because they are

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,579
not renders so people don't season so

00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:18,259
you have to go to say editor on like

00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:20,509
check for them explicitly in order to

00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:24,790
season and what you have to be aware of

00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:28,549
them so to run tourism I'll try to

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:30,980
improve our usage so we're under bicycle

00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:33,439
boxes we run the traffic coming

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,779
infrastructure as well we make the

00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:39,619
distinction between a bicycle locking on

00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:43,670
a sec short one which is supervised and

00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:47,959
for the elevators and the stairs we take

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:50,959
into account bicycle friendly attacks to

00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:53,480
to render them either in a gray or blue

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,869
depending if a bicycle friendly or nuts

00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:00,489
and our next goal is to render to give a

00:16:56,869 --> 00:17:04,220
traffic light sign which is French

00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:08,240
recreation but bike can pass at the red

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,860
light with a give way restriction while

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,019
this is represented by a quite

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,630
complicated scheme with a relation and

00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:15,649
often it's it's not added or it's

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,860
incomplete

00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:21,649
in French data so we would like to

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:25,100
render its first for secrecy to see it

00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:31,010
and then also for users to add it in a

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:33,230
visual way for the next steps visas were

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,649
still to be considered a beta this is

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,320
the first beta version let's say so in

00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:41,630
the upcoming months we plan to do quite

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,500
a lot of adjustments and open tickets so

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:48,230
all of this is on our github repo we

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,720
also plan to work on some rendering on

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,740
the performance of the style so far it's

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,480
working but this can be greatly improved

00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:00,580
and we also need quite a few

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,960
contributions on design beats icons or

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:08,980
Alstyne or like corals palette so yeah

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,350
we are taking contributions on this in

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:14,350
the well very soon we plan to add a

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:16,900
little relief for sinful planets so far

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:20,350
the version online which show afterwards

00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:23,410
it does not have this data we also plan

00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,300
to work on the key of the map and to is

00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,920
a contributing workflow we'd like to

00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:32,590
have this idea of generating key

00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:36,580
automatically from a tiny fake awesome

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:40,990
world to be sure but the key displayed

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:42,910
is always in sync with render code and

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:46,000
we plan also to try to have a lite

00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:48,220
version without what we've reduced

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,010
number of POS and without cycle routes

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:58,059
and this one would be usable as a base

00:18:51,010 --> 00:19:01,170
map for custom maps of operands so our

00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:05,380
big announcement today is that we have

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:08,620
our style is available worldwide and

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,990
it's a light updated so this is done

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,059
thanks to the servers provided by the

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:17,970
French local chapter so many thanks to

00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:27,820
them so this is available at

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:30,030
www.iowadnr.gov a directly at github if

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:33,460
you want to have a look on contributes

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:37,450
we also propose to have a record session

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:40,840
tomorrow at 10:30 in room mathematically

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,059
to talk about Biesecker in OS m on the

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,320
about eco system run by cycle in

00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:47,230
OpenStreetMap

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:52,750
with tools on from the tools and tagging

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:59,020
perspective on your contacts if you want

00:19:52,750 --> 00:20:01,520
to to get in touch about this so thanks

00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,200
for attention and very fun questions

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:08,229
[Music]

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,229
[Applause]

00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:16,580
so does anyone have question

00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:23,510
[Music]

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:32,820
so which technique are you using behind

00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:40,609
is it is it Carlo and always em - peachy

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:46,289
SQL or something else you mean for the

00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:49,709
style for coding style so what this is

00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:54,029
so currently this is while living on oh

00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:57,059
s NFL servers so there is one regular

00:20:54,029 --> 00:21:00,869
import into a Pascal scale database and

00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:02,999
when we use calculus CSS style - well

00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:07,259
it's it's just go to CSS just the same

00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:09,239
as the OSM dot-org style so it's a

00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:14,359
standard one and so it's the same

00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:16,739
technique okay so this is a drop-in

00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:19,849
replacement for standard kata style

00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:22,619
right so it works exactly the same as

00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:24,450
osm that all yeah but it's not meant to

00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:29,419
replace it because I send the talk is

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,419
like way larger than just cycling

00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:33,559
another question

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,280
thank you firstly have you actually

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,500
obtained the trademark for the use of

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,390
the OSM or have you obtained permission

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,680
to use OSN with them - main name because

00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,830
I believe that's not normally the mood

00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,870
and my main question was it seems to

00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,550
what you've created is a map of cycling

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,370
infrastructure and that's not

00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:05,309
necessarily what a cyclist always uses

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:08,309
I'm looking at my hometown Cambridge for

00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:10,110
example and some of the sort of key

00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:11,970
routes that you have as a sort of

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,740
cyclist in terms of how you're you're

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,390
sort of navigating through the city you

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,380
don't really get that sense coming out

00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,270
because there's lots of cycle

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,640
infrastructure which is is that a very

00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,050
heavily shown but there's something the

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,870
very heavily used routes that don't have

00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:27,960
cycling structure which do get used more

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,460
less I'm showing so I want to have yeah

00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,750
what was just something thinking in

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,380
terms of the compromise there between

00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:36,540
the sort of navigated that the sort of

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:46,380
like visualization of a city versus the

00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:48,770
actual infrastructure that exists are

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:52,559
you talking about the problems that some

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:56,130
a good road for sectioning is a road

00:22:52,559 --> 00:23:00,540
without cars mostly are you talking

00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,190
about that oh not necessarily I mean I

00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,450
think this many parts of the world for

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,610
example like where I live in Cambridge

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,380
where and you have you have routes that

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,390
really have no cycle infrastructure at

00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,820
all but it's still very heavily used and

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,290
an infrastructure really isn't very well

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,700
joined up and I think that's a very

00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:18,090
different thing to the like to say

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,350
Amsterdam maybe Paris to moist own where

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,030
you know you do actually have long

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,640
stretches of a properly connected

00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:26,040
network in places like Cambridge or many

00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,559
parts of the UK and infrastructure is

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,110
very spotty and so what you or you see

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,850
is a map that sort of shows that

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,559
infrastructure but doesn't really give

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,480
you a sense of actually the sort of if

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,190
you like the layout of the city which is

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,070
actually more how a cyclist tends to

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,809
some navigate in the UK sorry it's a bit

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,740
complicated but I am

00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:48,120
especially sex yeah but the primary

00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:52,679
cannot wander something that doesn't

00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:55,350
exist that cannot wander sake Network

00:23:52,679 --> 00:24:00,600
questions no cycling network so only

00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:03,179
thing we I wanted to to have is that - I

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:07,200
would love to have the traffic of roads

00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:11,070
and to render them on the map because

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:15,659
like I said a good word for cycling is a

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:19,379
world without traffic so but we don't

00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:25,139
have the title in OpenStreetMap so we

00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:28,320
only take the max speed which is a bad

00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:31,499
bad replacement because in Paris we can

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,590
have lots of a lot of sweet refounded

00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:36,779
such committers max speed but a lot of

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:42,350
traffic on them is not present at all -

00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:46,169
to go to go secure them so yeah I think

00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:52,759
there's no simple solution - to your

00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:52,759
program we have done for last question

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,190
thank you very much for your talk is it

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,679
possible already for end-users to click

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,720
together their own GPS track for cycling

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,970
on on the basis of your map because that

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,519
would be really interesting for when I

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,960
want to go road cycling and I have I

00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:16,759
don't know the race bag with me and I

00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:19,369
want to avoid gravel or anything so we

00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:23,119
are aiming at providing a map so if you

00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:24,820
go to cycle lesson that that oh you have

00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,679
the map you have the view of the map

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:30,019
then we are not looking particularly

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,119
into building an ecosystem with

00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:37,220
applications on so on with it

00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:40,429
but the tiles are were subject to fair

00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:43,029
use policy but rigid visible so you can

00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:45,710
just use the tiles you in whatever

00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:47,539
application you are using so for

00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,970
instance if you are using osmond on your

00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:52,249
Android device you can tell him to load

00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:56,599
the tiles online and you will have like

00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:59,479
all the power of osmond plus the tiles

00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:01,970
from cycle robeson if you are using

00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:04,039
pewter for instance you can also

00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:07,279
customize the tiles on roads you got

00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:09,639
some tires so yeah you can it's it's

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,670
just about the map it's not about

00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:16,880
ecosystem thanks a lot guys

00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,880
