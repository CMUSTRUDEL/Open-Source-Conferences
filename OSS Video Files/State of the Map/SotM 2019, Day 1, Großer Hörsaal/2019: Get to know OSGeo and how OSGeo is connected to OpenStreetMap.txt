Publication date: 2019-09-24
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 1, GroÃŸer HÃ¶rsaal
Description: 
	OSGeo is all about Open Source Software, Open Data and Open Education. Learn about OSGeo and what builds up this great organization and find out how OpenStreetMap is used by OSGeo projects, how OpenStreetMap can use OSGeo projects and how the two OSGeo and OpenStreetMap are conneted.

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to foster global adoption of open geospatial technology by being an inclusive software foundation devoted to an open philosophy and participatory community driven development. The foundation provides financial, organizational and legal support to the broader open source geospatial community. 

OSGeo vision: Empower everyone with open source geospatial

OSGeo was founded in 2006 and is well established as a global organization with Local Chapters all over the world. OSGeo represents and supports more than 25 software projects (https://www.osgeo.org/projects/) like QGIS, PostGIS or GDAL. 

OSGeo organizes many events global and regional all over the world (https://www.osgeo.org/events/). On every event OpenStreetMap is a topic in some of the talks or workshops.

The initiative GeoForAll (https://www.osgeo.org/initiatives/geo-for-all/) is an OSGeo Committee and has an Educational outreach and has the mission for making geospatial education and opportunities accessible to all.

There is also the OSGeoLive project that covers more than 50 software projects, Open Data and also documentation and tutorials. OSGeoLive is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive or Virtual Machine based on Lubuntu, that allows you to try a wide variety of open source geospatial software without installing anything. OpenStreetMap data and software are also included on OSGeoLive.

OpenStreetMap data is involved in many OSGeo projects f.e. as sample data, sample service. There is also functionality available to handle OSM data f.e the variety of OSM specific plugins for QGIS or support for OSM in GDAL (https://www.gdal.org/drv_osm.html) or routing on OSM data with pgRouting.

Learn about OSGeo and how OSGeo and OSM are connected and join the OSGeo community.

hello everybody welcome back for the

00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,640
first real session let's see we have

00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:20,600
here

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,640
Astrid Emma she's from osg oh she has

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,240
been involved with her with Gio's member

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,500
since 2010 and his board member since

00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,660
2017 I think and she's gonna tell us

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:44,690
everything about Gio and how it is

00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:47,270
interacting with OpenStreetMap it's my

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,760
first Saturn so I'm very glad to be here

00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,670
I'm involved in no issue since a long

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,040
time since the beginning in 2006 and

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:59,149
with this presentation oh let's see

00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,570
I would like to introduce you into a CEO

00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:05,089
and see how issue is connected to

00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:08,329
OpenStreetMap and how it is a great

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:10,340
combination so the talk is get to know

00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:12,679
is you and how is you is connected to

00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,869
OpenStreetMap open source software and

00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:17,030
open education making use of

00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:20,240
OpenStreetMap data and we are really

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,560
happy that OpenStreetMap is there so i

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,289
said i'm in the board

00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,159
I live in Cologne and Germany and so it

00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:29,840
was easy to get here and I was here in

00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,479
2011 with Foster's conference where we

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,450
had the pleasure to be in Heidelberg or

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,409
already so as you can see here I'm part

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:44,289
of OSU and OpenStreetMap I'm a mapper as

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:44,289
well but didn't map so much yet and

00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,939
let's see what else you is about so we

00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:51,709
have so many acronyms and maybe not

00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:53,329
everyone knows what it means

00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:54,590
so it's open source geospatial

00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,460
foundation

00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:01,420
and it stands for free open

00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:04,670
self-organizing and global community and

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,130
let's see what who is you is about it's

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:10,099
a nonprofit software organization

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,739
providing organizational legal and

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:14,709
financial supports for projects we will

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:18,019
learn about the projects in a minute

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:20,599
OSU is volunteer driven so we don't have

00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:23,300
staff we don't have employees everyone

00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,400
is stunned by the community we have

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,650
passionate members all over the world

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,650
and individuals that run with you and

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,080
OSU promotes adoption of open geospatial

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,360
technology all around the world and we

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,360
have partnerships open approaches to

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,830
software standards data and education so

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,080
that's a short introduction on OSU and

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,630
the history if we look back here you can

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,260
see the old logo it was established in

00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,390
2006 at a meeting in Chicago with

00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,470
financial support of outer desk at that

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:02,870
time and some companies were involved

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:06,620
you will see in a minute and just a note

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:09,560
I was M was there already so it was 2004

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:14,660
when OpenStreetMap was founded and this

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,850
meeting was driven and organized by some

00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,850
companies you can buy some projects you

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:22,850
can see here it was GDL mapserver

00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,190
q GS Russkies and post kids who were

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,959
already there these are software

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,280
projects and people from these

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:35,989
communities were running the meeting and

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:39,400
founded Sto so our goal is supporting

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:43,010
open-source software development and

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,500
this means that we support projects and

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,170
we have at the moment 25 graduated

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,170
projects all these projects go to

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,959
through an incubation process so we

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,030
review the code we watch whether the

00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,090
community is active whether the mailing

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:02,230
list is there could have come there

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,930
a license where all these information is

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:10,080
provided and then after this incubation

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:13,270
process software projects are yeah

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,980
getting a few projects and here you can

00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:18,190
see we have projects from different

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:21,040
categories web mapping desktop libraries

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,500
and spatial data emitted other catalogs

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:29,410
and others maybe you don't know all of

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:31,870
them but yeah it's a good combination

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:36,100
and some of the projects are combining

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:39,729
together and sharing ideas and interact

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:42,010
with each other so in addition to the

00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:45,060
OST of projects we have community

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,950
projects they are not incubated already

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,229
but maybe they want to incubate and get

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,350
to your project or maybe they are only

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:55,960
our friends and our associated to OSU so

00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,330
here you can see the project's marked

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,150
with stars there are projects that are

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:05,910
in incubation process at the moment like

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:08,410
prout by library for transformation or

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:13,600
scallion which is a web

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:16,060
she has clients and many more here you

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,850
can see the logos of all our new

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,000
projects and Friends so what you see

00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:26,560
it's a big variety of software products

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,350
and yeah many of these projects love osm

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,340
because with OpenStreetMap we have the

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,320
possibility to easily get data and use

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,230
it in our software project so a lot of

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,110
them into

00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,580
focus treatment already so for example

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,940
of layers and leveland

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:47,210
they have support for street map

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:49,880
services we have osm based services as

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:53,960
base maps for example for map and ER

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:57,470
we have desktop is queue keys which is

00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:02,060
possible to load osm data which is your

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:03,950
2g the library that supports OS m and

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,990
that is integrated in a lot of software

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,940
projects and maybe if you are interested

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,720
in routing PT routing could be

00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,430
interesting for you which also enables

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,210
makes possible routing on OpenStreetMap

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:20,060
data so we love OpenStreetMap and maybe

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,840
OS and users love osu projects as well

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,390
because for example was huge yes you can

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,050
easily visualize your own speed map data

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:32,120
and make nice projects nice maps and the

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,910
other software you also can use your own

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,570
who Street Map data so we both work

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:41,660
together very good with you we have a

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:44,210
meeting every year all the projects and

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,630
friends we meet at our annual foss4g

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,850
conference this was some weeks ago in

00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,490
Bucharest and here you can see the

00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:55,700
people who are running or CEO so as I

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,620
said I'm in the OSU board for two years

00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:01,190
people are elected and the board and

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,670
here you can see the directors that are

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:07,880
active at the moment and we have

00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:10,790
president this is maria maria de reina

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:14,030
that's her we have a secretary that's me

00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:17,990
we have a treasurer that's my toe is he

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:20,450
and we have a chief returning officer

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,540
they are responsible for the elections

00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:26,930
which will approach in some weeks where

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,690
we will run for new board elections and

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:32,630
we have a lot of OSU committees which

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:36,590
are maybe focusing on marketing on

00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:41,120
technical things on local chapters and

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:44,090
run the community so let's see how many

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,240
members we have yeah when you have a

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,610
look at the wiki we have more than 5,600

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,580
members but there are some BOTS around

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,160
there so maybe that's not a very good

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,650
number we have a new website when more

00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,530
than 900 registrations are done on the

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,260
website and you could fill a profile for

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,810
your registration and tell us about who

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:09,590
you are on the website we have several

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:11,960
mailing lists for all our projects and

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:15,050
we have mailing lists for with you but

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:19,310
you can share ideas so there we have

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:23,180
more than 30 South 30 3,700 when you

00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:26,479
need registrations and so it's not very

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:29,510
clear to say who are the osu members and

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,910
how many we are but we have elected

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,510
members we call them charter members and

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:38,000
there are people from our community that

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:42,770
got suggested by others and that may be

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,920
a very active or developer activist and

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:49,850
they records and their countries and

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,860
promote OSU for us so you can if you are

00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,560
not a shadow member yet you could get

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,920
elected in the next election process and

00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,709
again if we compared with OpenStreetMap

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,470
the actual numbers from June are that

00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:08,990
there are five over five million of a

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:11,600
street map registration so that's much

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,180
more than always go health we have local

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,170
chapters we have 30 local chapters all

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,209
over the world they organize meetups

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:23,000
conferences coats wins they reported

00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:25,399
this annual general meeting and they

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,649
manage translations maybe of the

00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,160
software or documentation and promote

00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:33,560
with you in their countries and let's

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,380
let's ask the questions local chapters

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,420
are they connected to OpenStreetMap for

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,080
the German local chapter first years we

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:45,050
can say yes they are very much connected

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,959
because first years as a journal in

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,940
which local chapter from OSU and also

00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:53,420
the official local chapter for the

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,770
OpenStreetMap foundation for Germany so

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:59,180
in Germany or in German language

00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:02,570
countries it's the case we are more than

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:05,750
200 members we have our good combination

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:08,810
first years and OpenStreetMap maybe we

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,880
have different interests some are more

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:14,150
focused on software the others more on

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,670
data and amenities tax and how to map

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:20,029
and the others more in software but we

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,890
are working fine together and maybe if

00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:25,370
you look at our local chapters this

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:28,339
combinations there as well so OSU is

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,829
working quite good together with local

00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,630
street map and people are not only

00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:33,610
always to you but maybe both in one

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,980
person

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,990
so these conferences we run the global

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,840
one is every year

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,400
we headed in Bucharest in at the end of

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,880
August and here you can see where

00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,610
phosphor t traveled around the world

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,800
next year it is in Calgary and August in

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,840
Canada and here you can see our

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,760
community in Bucharest there were more

00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,040
than thousand people some of them are

00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,320
here and see smiles in the audience and

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:04,450
we had a great event there

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:08,080
so these phospho jeez they don't only

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:10,930
coveralls to you but also osm topics so

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,080
there are many talks about technology

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:16,120
and about mapping as well and you can be

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,870
developers you can talk about new

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,840
features and software but you also can

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:26,310
talk about use cases and often solutions

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:29,800
with street map are presented there and

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:32,170
in addition to this yeah it's dancing

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,930
and party that's a big part of hospital

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:37,060
as well roof and we have challenge so

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:42,820
maybe they are this year there was a big

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:44,950
party maybe you can't see probably but

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,460
they were standing and a lot of music

00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:50,830
and we had a lot of fun so if you can't

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,200
come to this global conference we have

00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,360
many many regional conferences going on

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,510
all over the year while we are here in

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,480
the UK there is a hospital ok going on

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:04,000
last bit was phosphatase Japan and its

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,550
really a vibrant community and as you

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,550
can see here for example phosphor cheese

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:14,930
so Tamaki Anya will be in November and

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:19,180
in the title already of Sodom so it's a

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:20,510
combination of phosphor G and Sutton

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,270
yeah

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,970
we have conferences we have community

00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:27,770
sprints we call them maybe you have map

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,170
atones we have communities or code

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:35,200
sprints where we spend time together

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:39,200
codes write documentation and whatever

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,230
we do we have them quite often here and

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,630
at Linux hotel force just if he is

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,700
organizing it twice a week twice a year

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,280
in Essen at the Linux hotel and these

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,160
are pictures from there but we have it

00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,810
also all over the world and this is a

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,120
picture from last year where we have

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,730
been and are Salaam after 4:30

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,500
conference and it's nice to see where

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,830
all these people come from working on

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,960
software working on OpenStreetMap and

00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:09,620
sharing their ideas we are involved in

00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:12,350
google Summer of Code and since 12 years

00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:16,220
already and we run several projects with

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:18,640
in several projects we run solutions

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,650
with students from all over the world in

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,100
2019 we had seven students working for

00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:27,230
us working together with us we have

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,400
since and three years we are lost in

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:34,670
google code-in which are for pupils

00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:36,980
projects where they can work on and we

00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:41,480
we are present at conferences and other

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:45,410
events not 12 hours but where we are

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:48,259
invited so beyond software

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,709
and we work together with partners to

00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:54,429
promote our goal open source of data

00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:58,779
from standards of medical education

00:13:54,429 --> 00:14:01,849
Zorba science and we sign moves we say

00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:04,369
Memorandum of Understanding so we have

00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:08,179
14 organizations already that's right

00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:11,269
move with us and here you can see the

00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:13,599
first moment was signed in 2011 between

00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:16,429
OSU and the International hydrographic

00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:19,129
Association here you can see the first

00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:23,259
president a ton of crystal and and the

00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:26,089
second paper picture is Jeff McKenna

00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:29,689
together with George Carter signing this

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:33,259
MOU and now we have 14 most all together

00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:36,079
and one for example is signed in 2018

00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:39,709
with the used member community so here's

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,569
OpenStreetMap involved already but yeah

00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:46,159
the question may be why didn't we sign

00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:49,609
an MoU with OpenStreetMap itself so

00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:52,039
people from OSU and OpenStreetMap

00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:55,339
foundations they talked maybe at Linux

00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:57,199
hotel years ago in 2006 and in the

00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,289
following days they were discussing but

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,029
in the end no more was signed as

00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:05,479
OpenStreetMap does not do that they

00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:08,350
don't have moose but we have friends

00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:10,850
already and we are running events and

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:14,659
community already so that doesn't matter

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:18,379
and maybe it's no need for mo but we

00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:21,109
have category in our wiki where

00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:24,429
OpenStreetMap is listed as like-minded

00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:27,769
organizations so that's maybe a more us

00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:30,889
finish in minutes and seconds so we have

00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:33,739
another project its goldia for all its

00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:36,049
an OSU educational initiative and they

00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:38,389
are the street map is involved as well

00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:40,560
because we use this data for our

00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:44,069
webinars and courses

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,920
and here you can see the missions and

00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:49,620
goals of the do for all initiative and

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,569
you see that we have more than hundred

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,319
laps all over the world where

00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:59,339
universities or organizations provide

00:15:55,319 --> 00:16:01,139
rooms and computers of make torques

00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:03,360
where people can find out about all

00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:06,620
which geo software and if you are in a

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,329
university you can get involved and

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,459
there's one more project that I would

00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:14,910
like to introduce it's over for your

00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:17,670
life it's a software collection with

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,389
more than 50 projects that you can

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:25,230
download

00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:27,180
it's an Ubuntu an 18-4 version that has

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,670
all this software has data and

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,819
documentation you have always a quick

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,860
start and overview for all these

00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:38,879
projects and you find out the street map

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:41,850
data on this osu life we have every year

00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,819
the data of the actual phosphor g so

00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:49,019
this time it is bucharest data and we

00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:52,110
have OSF first software also on on this

00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:55,079
with you life so it's worth a try if you

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:58,259
want to try out all the software OSU

00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:00,509
it's really easy to get it running so my

00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:02,100
conclusion is almost you and

00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:06,299
OpenStreetMap are a great combination

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:08,669
and I want to wish you may the force be

00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:12,209
with you for the whole of conference for

00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:16,470
your whole life and I hope you enjoy the

00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:22,110
conference and have a great time and one

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:24,740
thing that I want to stop with now I

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,740
need the tone

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:35,650
so this is a musical that was

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,210
in Denver ostriches 2011 and it's Skylar

00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,880
Oh

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,040
singing everyone's a member on its own

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,250
way and this should show the diversity

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:48,490
in our community so everyone can do the

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:51,310
way you like and this is how our the

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,110
power of our community is and I had a

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,270
link to the slides maybe you can't hear

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,180
it so properly now but it's worth

00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,610
listening it's not only in front of a

00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:04,349
great with you people singing there and

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:07,809
presenting and less forcefully

00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:10,659
so yeah hope you enjoyed the

00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:21,070
introduction and hope you are curious

00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:22,119
about getting to know more about one

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,089
before okay

00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:26,830
great combination okay so if you want to

00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:28,479
learn more about we see you we have a

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,549
booth here it's autumn and you are

00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:36,039
welcome to come around get some stickers

00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:38,679
get information and get involved thanks

00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,889
a lot for your talk entry there are a

00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:40,889
big

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:53,679
I myself remember that dancing last year

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:55,720
in Tanzania really nice who would you

00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,610
have a question forestry practice

00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:12,999
wonderful combination of the two angles

00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:15,369
on mapping the world question hi +

00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:19,749
possible how to educate your

00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:22,419
partnerships work how do you prepare six

00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:24,669
book that was a question yeah okay if I

00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:27,700
showed it that was it you for all

00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:32,049
initiative so if you want to get

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:35,200
involved you can apply for a lab and in

00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:39,129
the dewfall website you finally what you

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,679
have to do to set up a lab so for your

00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:45,399
country or for your location you could

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,929
set up a lab and get involved and if you

00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:51,549
don't have a lab that you would like to

00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:55,960
invent you can share the do for chapter

00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:58,649
and get active there and yeah maybe

00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,649
that's a question

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:09,150
somebody else a question as a follow-up

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:13,410
to that one for your educational

00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:16,680
resources for schools do you tag that to

00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:22,260
the open education resources so it can

00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:24,210
be searched so my question is there are

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,250
lots of great resources out there for

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,620
teachers that want to teach students or

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:32,060
give them an opportunity to use spatial

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,680
analysis to look at real-world problems

00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,480
but it's hard to find those resources

00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,010
because they're not aligned to the

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,570
standards from the different

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:44,430
jurisdictions this question refers first

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:48,450
again tools at you for all initiative

00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:50,820
they are like an umbrella for getting

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,250
open source this educational more

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:57,030
widespread and maybe that's the best

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:59,970
point to do get connected to them to to

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:02,850
spread the educational material that

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,910
they are mission and I would suggest

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:09,360
those GU life it's a good starting point

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:13,640
as well this one has a question yeah I

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,640
think lime is a she's still around

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:21,840
you want the last one very very quick

00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:24,220
one well my name is tae ik's

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,350
I'm French but I've been living in

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,600
Brazil for more than 20 years and I've

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,580
been doing a worth of supporting

00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,500
OpenStreetMap very actively not that

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:36,250
much from the technical point of view

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:39,820
but more from the relationship point of

00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,490
view with governments etc and in fact

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:45,220
I've been to a foss4g once there in

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:49,930
Brazil but I didn't understand very well

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:53,140
what it was and I think I could do both

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:58,030
things in fact speaking more about Faust

00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,620
for OpenGL and not only about upon

00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,790
OpenStreetMap when I go visit

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,790
governments and companies

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,790
[Applause]

00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:12,460
yeah that was a statement but in fact

00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:20,350
there is an opportunity I mean it would

00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:23,470
that be something good to talk about so

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:26,230
an opportunity to focus more on because

00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:29,230
I'm doing a lot of contacts with

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:32,500
governments and companies tearing them

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,180
use more OpenStreetMap and I think there

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,840
is an openness to more things together

00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,840
with you

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:47,050
so that was quick I guess you can

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,670
continue the discussions discussions

00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,800
afterwards I think there are a lot of

00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:53,740
collaborations possible osg with is

00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,390
doing great work I'm very happy to help

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,050

00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,050
