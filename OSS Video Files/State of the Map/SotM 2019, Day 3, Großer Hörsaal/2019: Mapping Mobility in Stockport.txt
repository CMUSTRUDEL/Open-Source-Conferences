Title: 2019: Mapping Mobility in Stockport
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 3, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	In early 2019, Open Data Manchester teamed up with Stockport council, Disability Stockport 
and Age UK Stockport to crowdsource data around mobility and accessibility in the town centre. This talk will cover the mapping methodology, findings, difficulties and solutions, as well as suggesting ways in which we can better map for these communities, making the data collected for OSM more inclusive and accessible for all.

In early 2019, Open Data Manchester partnered with Stockport Council on a project called ‘Mapping Mobility Stockport’, funded through the ODI Geospatial Fund. Working with Age UK and Disability Stockport, the project crowdsourced data about accessibility issues in Stockport, drawing on the lived experiences of people with mobility impairments to supplement data already available to the council.

The municipal environment often includes barriers that exclude people with restricted mobility. These barriers may be the result of natural topography, historic planning, deterioration of the urban environment or planned and unplanned maintenance. Some of the barriers may not be known to the local authority. 

People with mobility impairments are on the frontline when it comes to negotiating these obstacles, and often have their own knowledge and strategies in negotiating and circumventing them. This is a resource that could be invaluable in helping others who face similar challenges, as well as helping local authorities identify where interventions need to be made.

One of the aims of Mapping Mobility Stockport was to begin to map and find ways to continue to share these strategies.

Using our Joy Diversion format as a basis, Open Data Manchester co-designed and ran a series of workshops with Age UK and Disability Stockport, which brought together different techniques and mobility strategies contained within the local community to enable people of all abilities to explore and map their environment.

We used large, hi-resolution maps of Stockport to scribble on and sketch out routes, before taking to the streets to document, photograph and map the kind of things that these communities come up against on a daily basis. This information was then added to Stockport Council’s mapping system and Open Street Map, helping create a mobility map of Stockport.

This talk will explore how we collected this data, sharing some of the findings and insights from the project, such as how what is useful for one disability can be problematic for another (such as tactile paving, which is useful for those with visual impairments but can be problematic for a wheelchair user). The talk will also explore the difficulties that arose out of this when categorising and tagging these features, and question whether more needs to be done in terms of mapping the streets and sidewalk.

	                              my name is Sam I'm from open data in                               Manchester                               I'm going to talk to you today about a                               project that we did in Stockport                               and hopefully give you some experiences                               that I hope the OSM community will                               benefit from hearing about so firstly                               what is math open data Manchester who                               are we so open data Manchester was                                established in                                                         earliest sort of open data organizations                                in the UK at least and our mission is to                                promote a fairer and more equitable                                society through the development of                                intelligent and responsible data                                practice across Greater Manchester but                                also nationally and internationally and                                so we advocate for local and national                                government data release we run workshops                                training events research we develop                                initiatives looking at working with data                                but we also promote organizations doing                                good work with data we're a small                                organization but we have a really wide                                community base with a diverse set of                                knowledge and skills so we do a lot of                                work around data standards such as the                                open contracting data standard you might                                heard about the                                                         we look at data governance rights and                                we're developing a declaration for                                responsible and intelligent data                                practice but we're also interested in                                the Internet of Things we run the things                                north network in in the UK but we also                                run a lot of monthly meetups occasional                                hackathons dig in the data that kind of                                thing and also our joy diversion meetups                                which I'll share a little bit about in a                                minute so we do a wide wide range of                                things so with mapping mobility                                Stockport we ain't to map the                                experiences of those with mobility or                                accessibility impairments look                                the roots and the strategies that they                                used to move in and out of Stockport                                Town Center the obstacles they came                                across the barriers would also the                                things that worked well as well                                the project was code designed with local                                charity disability Stockport and Age UK                                Stockport and was led by open data                                Manchester with Stockport Council as                                well with funding from the open data                                Institute I'm going to talk about sort                                of what we did what we found and                                basically you know the need to sort of                                ensure that we have more inclusive                                methodology in our mapping so this is a                                painting by LS Lowry some of you might                                know him he is a northern painter from                                northern the UK because you can see this                                isn't actually stock pop and it's nearby                                you can see but there's like lots of                                steps nice clean lines everything looks                                really nice and easy but if you've ever                                been to Stockport it's a little bit more                                like this it's quite confusing at first                                there's lots of layers I mean this is                                actually me experimenting with a                                    camera but I thought it gave a really                                good sense of one's experience stop on                                Town Centre at times but a more serious                                example this is this circle road here is                                called Market Place and it is next to                                the market place so it's quite a busy                                area but this is what it really looks                                like so it's not actually a straight                                line there's lots of data points there                                potentially but yet obviously it's                                mapped as a single line the point is the                                urban environment it often includes lots                                of barriers like the ones you can see                                here that exclude people with restricted                                mobility so that might be because of the                                topography you know historical planning                                just deterioration of the urban                                environment and some of these things                                might not actually be known to the local                                authority now as I say this is not                                unusual particularly for Stockport which                                is built over various levels                                steep inclines lots of stairs it's not                                the most accessible Town Center so as I                                say people with mobility impairments                                particularly in Stockport they are at                                the front line when it comes to                                negotiating these obstacles but they                                often have their own routes that they                                 take they often have their own                                 strategies that they use to get around                                 the town center and most of this                                 information isn't shared it's contains                                 Bob tacitly within the communities                                 themselves it could be for a variety of                                 reasons particularly with the groups                                 that I worked with they're not they                                 might use things like Google Maps thing                                 most of them probably haven't heard of                                 Open Street Map before so this kind of                                 thing perhaps might not get picked up                                 but this information the routes the                                 strategies the ways they move into and                                 out of the town centre it could be a                                 resource that could be really invaluable                                 in helping others who face similar                                 challenges particularly if you're                                 visiting the town as well as helping                                 local authorities identify where                                 interventions need to be made or in the                                 case of Stockport they re developing                                 their town centre so we were able to                                 feed directly into that so as I say we                                 worked with disability stop all Asia UK                                 support we designed a series of                                 workshops and I guess mapping parties is                                 kind of what we did and which drew                                 directly on their lived experience of                                 the town centre so workshops were sort                                 of based around the joint aversion                                 meetups that opendata Manchester                                 regularly runs throughout the year if                                 you were at the OSM OpenStreetMap UK AGM                                 last year and as some of you here were                                 you you'll be familiar with joy                                 diversion in a joy diversion                                 participants we take maps of Manchester                                 and Salford from the                                       and people look at what's changed look                                 at what's interesting they propose                                 expeditions form teams and they                                 basically just go out and see what they                                 can find they might do a bit of mapping                                 or they might just go and explore the                                 city it's primarily it's a fun meetup                                 it's designed for the whole family but                                 it is also about helping people                                 recognize and claim                                 ownership of their city you know the                                 streets are theirs but the format                                 provided a really good starting point                                 for the map and mobility project so we                                 designed two types or streams of                                 workshops which were designed to account                                 for the different needs and requirements                                 of the project participants the first                                 type of workshop consisted entirely of                                 indoor sessions we made use of high                                 resolution printed maps provided by                                 Stockport Council you can earn assim see                                 him there                                 we began basically by discussing areas                                 and generating a list of obstructions                                 and issues and beginning to identify                                 particular areas of notes so yeah so                                 this is the large high resolution                                 provided by the council we invited                                 people literally to scribble onto the                                 map so remember that many of these only                                 might have only really used things like                                 Google for search they might not be                                 digital at all so this information was                                 directly then fed to Stockport Council                                 and all relevant information into Open                                 Street Map as well here's an example of                                 one of the workshops in action this is a                                 UK Stockport's as you can see it was                                 generating a lot of discussion and these                                 discussions naturally led into you a                                 deeper dive into the problem areas                                 themselves participants began to share                                 their experiences in much more detail                                 and describe routes that they take on a                                 regular basis this is a session from                                 disability Stockport we had a variety of                                 disabilities who have wheelchairs of                                 multiple levels of blindness and one                                 gentleman would quite acute neurological                                 problem as where he's fine unless he's                                 going downhill so we were really started                                 to draw on some you know various                                 mobility impairments beyond just sort of                                 wheelchairs so this is an example of yet                                 of another workshop but which led into                                 the second                                 workshop which was outdoor expeditions                                 with the workshop participants and it                                 was from these that we got the most                                 information so we went out with people                                 one on one or in small groups and we had                                 digital recorders taking lots of                                 photographs and we asked the                                 participants to take the routes that                                 they normally take to travel on us or                                 daily or weekly basis and they we just                                 got them to narrate their experience in                                 sort of first-person to literally tell                                 us what was going on now trips were                                 weather dependent due to the time and                                 scope of the project we had to do this                                 between January and March I don't know                                 if you know Manchester or support in                                 January or March there was a lot of rain                                 there was a lot of snow so we perhaps                                 didn't get to go out as much as we would                                 like so this is where we fell back onto                                 the first type of workshop so we would                                 get the routes and I would go out in my                                 cold taking photos and taking pictures                                 like that and then bringing them back                                 for further discussion but we did try to                                 go out as much as we possibly could yeah                                 I mean the main great thing about the                                 outdoor expeditions is that they were                                 able to convey their experience of                                 accessing Stockport and as I said we've                                 got a broad range of impairments from                                 physical neurological visual that kind                                 of thing so what did we find so yeah we                                 gained some I mean personal needs some                                 incredibly and valuable insights which I                                 want to sort share there's the obvious                                 things dropped curbs that kind of thing                                 in front of driveways people in                                 OpenStreetMap who be very familiar with                                 this kind of thing                                 things like steps into shops or you know                                 these were the standard things we                                 expected to find this is one of my                                 favorites this is a dropped curb of                                 tactile paving leading to a raised curb                                 with no tactile paving on a really busy                                 bus route into the town centre okay so                                 luckily this is part of the the bus is                                 the area is being redeveloped and I can                                 confirm that Stockport Council are going                                 to be sorting this out so it was a                                 really positive outcome for the project                                 there but just things I did I didn't                                 realize maybe some of you might not                                 realize like different in the UK we have                                 different colored tactile paving for                                 different things so the red is where                                 there is a controlled crossing so you                                 press a button and the yellow is where                                 there is no controlled crossing so that                                 is obviously really useful but in some                                 areas of heritage they use grey and if                                 you are partially sighted grey is a very                                 difficult difficult color to sort of to                                 work with particularly interesting point                                 relating to the use of tactile paving                                 whilst useful for those with visual                                 impairments they can actually become a                                 hazard for a wheelchair user so                                 essentially the the chairs front wheels                                 the little jockeys can become caught on                                 the bumps and cause the person to be                                 thrown from their chair so John who is a                                 very very able-bodied very able person                                 regularly comes out of his wheelchair                                 because of tactile paving                                 so and in areas like this where tactile                                 paving stretches the width of the                                 pavement it's meant to guide the person                                 with visual impairment to the crossing                                 becomes even more difficult for a                                 wheelchair user so it's what's really                                 interesting that is you know what is                                 assistive for one person becomes an                                 obstacle for another and I think that's                                 a really really important thing to note                                 it also raises lots of questions around                                 things like this so areas of bad paving                                 or broken paving so obviously we use in                                 the UK things like fix my Street I don't                                 know if that's outside the UK or not but                                 this is an area that has a river running                                 underneath it so while the paving is                                 will be fixed it's an area that                                 regularly has problems so there was a                                 whole question about how all do you map                                 should that you don't you can't map each                                 individual broken paving but the area                                 itself perhaps can be flagged in some                                 way and what about this so this looks                                 fine at the moment but                                 summer that's loads of brambles that                                 whole paving will be covered with                                 brambles so suddenly that becomes                                 problematic and this is just an example                                 of the high street that is used                                 regularly you can see Bullards a boards                                 taking up pavement space you know could                                 this be how would you look at that bolas                                 and lampposts you know ask something                                 more permanent here's another view you                                 can actually see a mobility scooter in                                 the background and zipping down a very                                 busy road because he can't use the                                 pavement in fact Stockport Council                                 requires all shops to register their                                 Able's so they're supposed to be                                 supposed to be in line with bollards so                                 we know that this is an area of ongoing                                 potentially limited accessibility this                                 is a just around the corner from                                 disability Stockport's building so as                                 you can see there's not really an                                 accessible drop curb no tactile paving                                 this is on the other side so that's the                                 other side of the street so you can all                                 see how that's problematic but how do we                                 map this do we map this what kind of                                 factors do we need to take into account                                 so this is what we kind of collected                                 this is what Stockport Council put                                 together so this is all the information                                 that we collected within the scope of                                 the project so you can start to see                                 hotspots along with that captured                                 information we can this has been really                                 useful for Stockport Council in planning                                 their Town Center redevelopment and the                                 documentation is potentially useful for                                 those who want to use it but perhaps not                                 the most accessible really unfortunately                                 this will destroy as the scope of our                                 project got but it for me it opened up a                                 much wider question which is something                                 that I think there's a lot of discussion                                 today about which is can we make can we                                 make our Maps and routing out some more                                 inclusive and how so obviously when                                 planning to get from A to B Maps tend to                                 give us the fastest or most efficient                                 route but they don't often take into                                 account the wide variety of mobility and                                 accessibility needs so whilst there is                                 plenty of information there's lots of                                 maps and apps that can help guide people                                 around public buildings or trans                                 systems such as wheelmap or sociability                                 a lot of these celebrate on the                                 assumption that people with                                 accessibility needs just sort of catch                                 and get to those locations in the first                                 place and with the case of will map but                                 there's certainly not a lot of data in                                 the UK on will map this is a quote from                                 Pete who has total blindness and he has                                 is his it's one of the best arguments                                 I've seen from up in the pavement so to                                 to most people the road is the same                                 whichever way you're going but for me                                 each side of the pavement is a                                 completely different terrain to learn I                                 thought that was that was really really                                 powerful observation there are some                                 examples in the UK at least of how it's                                 being done this is a map of Easley that                                 gives users an accessible route from the                                 train station to the town centre this is                                 a community built map of Hebden Bridge                                 you can see it's cut they've color-coded                                 the sidewalk so you can get a sense of                                 how easy or difficult certain terrains                                 may be like why is this crowd-sourced                                 map of Casa Fiorentina in Tuscany as                                 detailed color-coded system for                                 navigating the most accessible routes                                 through the area but but these are                                 printed Maps not much use in terms of                                 sharing data you know and obviously if                                 you can't actually see or read what                                 about digital routing software we are                                 starting to see a growth of awareness in                                 the need to provide accessibility                                 options which is great but whilst this                                 haven't yet made it to you perhaps the                                 most commonly used routing and mapping                                 apps yet there are ventures like project                                 sidewalk or access map I think there                                 these are some quite good examples I've                                 seen that I think of beginning to tip                                 the balance although coverages and                                 widespread and at present but it's also                                 important to point out that these focus                                 on mobility and accessibility mostly                                 just wheelchair or scooters and not                                 other ones as well so open route service                                 I think was discussed just now shows                                 promise incorporates different                                 wheelchair profiles allowing you to make                                 adjustments for your route preferences                                 but at present only caters for those in                                 wheelchairs and scooters and I've not                                 actually been able to get this to work                                 because as I think the gentleman said                                 that                                 data is quite sparse okay so there needs                                 to be a greater awareness of the needs                                 of map mobility and accessibility in a                                 more detailed way width of road inclined                                 camber things like bullard street signs                                 in the middle of the pavement these are                                 permanent fixtures fixtures that could                                 be mapped and in my opinion maybe it                                 maybe should be you know no different to                                 say drop curbs and just in tactile                                 paving at the same time if we're an                                 able-bodied person like myself we cannot                                 presume to know what to look for and                                 what to map right you know working to a                                 consensus in a sort of Wikipedia style                                 is really good but is not the same as                                 equality is not the same as inclusion                                 you know with any consensus based system                                 how do we make sure the voices of the                                 marginalized are heard and included it                                 needs to be part of the design if you                                 get it wrong from the start then the                                 systems itself may not be able to                                 describe the experiences you want to                                 describe and I think that's really                                 really important I think with the                                 mapping mobility project it was a good                                 pilot for a methodology that quickly and                                 inclusively crowd-sourced a lot of dates                                 are on a very localized level and I                                 think that the OpenStreetMap community                                 is you know potentially in the best                                 position to push this to push this in                                 the right direction after all you know                                 look how quickly it created what the the                                 most detailed crowdsource map of the                                 world with this extremely flexible                                 tagging system there's absolutely no                                 reason that some standards could be                                 developed for all manner of disabilities                                 and needs but just hammer the point home                                 we have to be careful when presuming to                                 map for people and not not you know not                                 with them or by them unless we are                                 helping those communities to map for                                 themselves you know mapping with them                                 then we risk creating more biases yeah                                 we regardless of our intentions so just                                 some sort of next set of policy we need                                 to do need to think about how we                                 describe different mobility impairments                                 different experiences and this does need                                 to be led I think from the communities                                 themselves we're not just talking about                                 wheelchair users we're talking visual                                 impairments acute neurological                                 impairments each with their own unique                                 abilities and disabilities and what                                 we've seen is that you know what works                                 one person might not work for another                                 person ideally we want these communities                                 to be mapping for themselves with the                                 groups we work with they simply don't                                 use programs such as OS n so they need                                 to be provision for training that kind                                 of thing we're King and opened it in                                 Manchester to continue this project all                                 of our stuff is in the open it's on our                                 on us on our github you can download                                 what we didn't you're a methodology and                                 do it yourself and if it's something                                 that you want to replicate and try out                                 in your community or you have                                 suggestions then we'd love to talk to                                 you I'm around for the rest of the day                                 yeah I think that's it so thank you very                                 much                                 [Applause]                                 thank you Sam for this interesting                                 presentation do we have questions                                 I often find that anything that isn't a                                 nuisance for me personally is not                                 something I have the confidence to                                 support on - Matt how would I how could                                 I addressed that that's a really good                                 question and I think I think part of it                                 is including the person for people who                                 might find that an obstacle you know as                                 I say we can't all there are certain                                 things that we know are there like the                                 drop curbs tactile paving of things that                                 can be mapped but I think you're right                                 you're not entirely sure if you should                                 map it because it might be an obstacle                                 or a nuisance then perhaps you know one                                 element is to sort of not map it but                                 then the other one is maybe go and talk                                 to your local charity or a local                                 community group but who might be                                 interested in that sort of thing                                 I'm assuming them part of your problem                                 of moving on is about getting funding to                                 do carry on projects like this is there                                 any interest with government yeah that's                                 absolutely right I mean we're I'm                                 looking for ways to continue this in                                 Stockport there is another council in                                 Greater Manchester I'm not going to say                                 their name - I don't want to drop the                                 minute in case they pull out but who are                                 also who are interested in the project                                 they were interested in mapping sound                                 auditory levels on certain streets or                                 people perhaps on autistic spectrum who                                 are affected by different sound levels                                 so we've actually been talking to them                                 so there is ways we're looking but yeah                                 I hope it gets used again where someone                                 else is it's really important that stuff                                 you doing thank you yeah thanks a lot of                                 questions                                 I think this free presentation is really                                 inspiring and yeah great to see the work                                 that's going on up in Manchester I was                                 wondering you mentioned earlier on that                                 most people you were working with hadn't                                 necessarily heard of osm and tended to                                 use things like Google Maps or Apple                                 maps is there a way for this data that                                 you're collecting to find its way back                                 into those products to find them find                                 this information over an integral and so                                 on just a good question and that's not                                 something that uh that we've looked at                                 at this point I think we've been mostly                                 focusing on Open Street Map you have a                                 stream map community haven't looked at                                 any of the wider ones I mean you know                                 you do tend to find that things that end                                 up in OpenStreetMap do turn up in Google                                 and Bing and so I think part of it is                                 because we covered it from a very                                 community grassroots level it feels to                                 me like that's the best position to the                                 OS                                                                   think that's where the push can really                                 come from actually if just and we are                                 starting to see it as the previous talk                                 you know there is more of an interest in                                 accessibility mapping accessibility                                 providing accessibility routing I think                                 that you know all the best ideas get                                 stolen right so if the open stream that                                 community is continues to do it in such                                 a great way I think it wouldn't be long                                 before we start to see it in another                                 more mainstream perhaps the more common                                 maps and apps if I can call them that                                 yeah we have time for one more question                                 if that's not the case let's thank them                                 again for making the world more                                 accessible                                 you
