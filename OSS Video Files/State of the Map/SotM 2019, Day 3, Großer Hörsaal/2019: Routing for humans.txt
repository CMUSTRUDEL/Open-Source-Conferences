Description: 
	The OpenStreetMap provides probably the most comprehensive digital path network for pedestrians, which had been largely unused in its actual depth of detail so far. Based on findings from the TERRAIN project, this talk will go into detail how this network can be used for roadside-aware pedestrian navigation efficiently, and what challenges and mappings problems occurred. Furthermore, specific needs of various person groups will also have to be considered facing variable data quality.

People primarily move on sidewalks, but this is hardly taken into account in generally available routing solutions. The OpenStreetMap provides probably the most comprehensive digital path network for pedestrians, which had been largely unused in its actual depth of detail so far. Through an efficient and transparent topological extension of the path network, more accurate routes for pedestrians and other means of transportation can now be determined, revealing hitherto unnoticed mapping problems and an undesirable previous focus on automotive mobility.

As part of the TERRAIN project, an exemplary publicly available navigation system for blind persons was developed that demonstrates the special challenges of human locomotion based on the OpenStreetMap. Challenges and robust solutions concerning data quality, micro-mapping and transition areas, regional OSM semantics versus mapper interpretations, and path bundling are presented.

A large part of the footpaths in the OpenStreetMap are listed in the form of annotations as sidewalks. This well-proven procedure enables a low-maintenance, robust and high coverage of the footpath network. However, a presentation with many paths inevitably leads to contradictions due to path bundling, which requires a more elaborate micro mapping, which is often not noticed by mappers up to now, and can now be shown clearly. But also regional micro mapping can lead to unexpected complications in addition to the increased effort, since a multitude of connection problems can occur which have to be considered.

In addition, there are a large number of requirement profiles for children, adults, the disabled or the elderly who travel on foot, in wheelchairs or on scooters. A deeper examination of the map data enables a finer specialisation in different areas of application, which also uncovers and challenges previously unused data treasures and requires special handling in the software.

	                              please welcome Sebastian                               hit the bush he's a professor on the                               University of Mannheim he is doing                               podcasts on topic of mathematics called                               del unser and today he will be                               presenting issues with respect to                               rooting for humans the state she steals                               thank you salmon hello it's an honor for                               me to be able to speak here at the state                                of the map here in Heidelberg and I'm                                not at the Mannheim university but the                                cooperative State University in Mannheim                                and German dahab Aviv and I'm here for                                Utah go and if you look into your                                program it says I explained information                                systems yes that's also correct but the                                company decided to newly found this new                                company who Targo to emphasize that they                                really want to go further in human                                routing and provide solutions to this so                                that's why it says root I'll go over                                there that's even more current than what                                was said before so I'm going to talk                                about writing for humans and first I                                would like to introduce by this is an                                important topic obviously most of you                                here are not born in a car or born on a                                bicycle so the main way how we are                                moving on streets is obviously on the                                side of the street that's what we tell                                our children because it's more safer to                                do and also if they we want them to                                cross the street they should do this at                                traffic lights while that's obvious but                                if you look at the currently available                                solutions they usually tell us to walk                                in the middle of the road as if there                                were no cars and this of course doesn't                                really make sense if you want to show                                where pedestrians should walk and also                                decide which way to go because if you're                                the one on the other side it might be a                                completely different path you should                                take to get to your goal and that's why                                we                                like to use the awesome data for                                scalable and robust routing that really                                uses the available annotations that are                                there but have not been really used that                                well so far because the USM not only has                                the largest foot path Network but it                                also has the largest foot path network                                that isn't really used because most of                                the put paths are annotated with                                sidewalk equal to yes or left or right                                or both and as these are not separate                                paths most of the route routing                                solutions are not using it like refa /                                you have to change the routine graph                                before you can really use it first of                                all I would like to say why did I get                                into this topic before because probably                                you haven't heard of me before                                concerning routing so I coordinated the                                terrain project which is a federally                                Moore was federally funded project by                                the federal ministry for education and                                research in Germany it was a joint                                research effort of the cars Institute of                                Technology as well as the two companies                                X point and Papa Mayan and the idea was                                to support independent mobility mobility                                of people with low vision or blindness                                there is saying many no longer feel                                confident leaving their homes because                                they don't know what obstacles they                                encounter outside so what were we                                planning to do first of all we had a                                group working on computer vision they                                try to identify that there are traffic                                lights where is the crossing if there                                are cars in the way of bicycles another                                group worked on system emulation what                                methods are there good what devices can                                be used what watches what vibration                                valves another group worked on                                innovative bryant's support breyer                                devices then of course we had some                                experts working on human-computer                                interaction because having data or                                having sensor input and not being able                                to tell the person who is blind wouldn't                                work at all so                                we're also looking out on how we best                                tell the persons which way to go or                                where their obstacles and then of course                                there was the roadside and we're safe                                routing which we looked into this and                                that's how I got involved into all this                                 and then we also had a group working                                 together with citizens how they might                                 react if someone walks around with a                                 camera or even having more knowledge on                                 the surrounding by use of maps than                                 other persons generally they were very                                 augment we like the idea so in the end                                 everything should work as a solution on                                 a smartphone because that's the                                 supercomputer we're wearing with us all                                 the time so that's the best tool we can                                 use to provide help for people with                                 blindness or low vision so what is the                                 state of pedestrian routing and as a                                 first example I would like to show you                                 how a current solution I just tried this                                 last week what path is provided by a                                 current solution going from the company                                 to my home and they see well it years is                                 the same data it uses for car rotting                                 and again the the path it provides are                                 centered on roads but some paths are                                 even quite dangerous for instance it                                 goes directly into a tunnel I can assure                                 you                                 pedestrians I'm not allowed in there and                                 I would never go even close because                                 there's no space for pedestrians they're                                 forbidden dance really really dangerous                                 so you cannot rely on such solutions                                 which is by the way it's the EPI routing                                 to give you inside where to go and also                                 it doesn't give you any instructions and                                 I don't even want to start about where                                 to cross so it's not really helping                                 although it's the best thing we have so                                 far and blind people love to use the EPI                                 routing or the Google routing where in                                 this case will would have sent me over                                 hiking trail which is wonderful                                 nice and I'd love to take the throat but                                 it's not really a safe path and I                                 wouldn't use it to go there so let's                                 look at a proper benchmark problem this                                 is a hard floor I compared what routes                                 are proposed by Google and Apple maps                                 and of course the open road service                                 which relies on grandpa power and osm so                                 first of all Google Apple Maps this                                 solution                                 well it's centered on the roads it                                 doesn't even think about where to cross                                 roads yes generally it's okay if you are                                 able to find out where to go and you                                 feel quite confident walking in the                                 streets by the way blind persons do                                 orientation and mobility training they                                 are quite well                                 walking around in cities but actually I                                 think we can do much better the open                                 route service does it much better it                                 even knows where there's traffic lights                                 but it is look closely you see just at                                 the point where there is a traffic light                                 it doesn't cross the street it proposes                                 from then on please walk on the middle                                 on the road and go where you want to go                                 and well it doesn't really help as well                                 but religion is it just uses what's                                 there before there was a separate path                                 it uses it very well but from then on                                 well it can't do anything anymore                                 so what solutions are there and there is                                 an obvious solution micro mapping and as                                 an example for micro mapping I would                                 like to talk about the open sidewalks or                                 access map project where there were                                 millions put into in the u.s. to extend                                 the road map network to having                                 pedestrian paths as a first class                                 citizen in the open street map and if                                 you look into this maps you see really                                 all pedestrian sidewalks light out                                 separately with a lot of data with all                                 kurup's everything in there they                                 combined a lot of different data sources                                 used a lot of computing resources to                                 all the information in there that's                                 available wonderful great and you can                                 use just additional routers to get the                                 best results but there are some problems                                 with it                                 first of all maintainability who is                                 going to fix something if there is a                                 construction or anything you have to                                 connect all the dots it's a problem with                                 micro mapping you there's so many things                                 you can do wrong where you lose the                                 connection and suddenly you get weird                                 results and routing these are things                                 that are very troublesome and the other                                 part is well this map you see there if                                 you just scroll it a few meters of about                                                                                                         part of the city where they just didn't                                 put data in suddenly there's no path                                 anymore so do you use traditional router                                 you back to the old setting it doesn't                                 really know where to cross and actually                                 I think we can do much better                                 another approach was done by Schmidt's                                 antal they did exactly what I mentioned                                 before why don't we extend the                                 OpenStreetMap programmatically to create                                 a path Network where our traditional                                 routers can find the best way because we                                 have the sidewalk Tech's we know it's                                 written there we know this on the right                                 or left side the society why don't we                                 extend the past there that's what they                                 did they did a geometric except relation                                 from the roads to the sidewalks where                                 they where there should be either on                                 both sides or right or left then they                                 also added orthogonal additional paths                                 at crossings then they create a lot of                                 lis nodes they connected the buildings                                 it's wonderful it works exactly as we                                 expected could be a wonderful solution                                 for us the problem is why you don't see                                 it widely spread you have to do this                                 transformation in the very beginning on                                 all data because they do this geometric                                 approach and you don't know where do the                                 nine segments yeah meet each other and                                 so that's a bit troublesome and also                                 they have to add at least their condyle                                 good algorithm the an individual cost                                 function at transfer time ten some time                                 so this means if you want to have                                 another mode of human locomotion you                                 have to do all the things again so                                 that's probably why it hasn't been used                                 so while this spread                                 so what we are proposing what we did is                                 what we call the transparent expansion                                 which I would like to illustrate you on                                 an example it also in Karlsruhe that's                                 the hood of plots it's yeah place where                                 trams where cars and of called                                 pedestrians meet and there you on the                                 one hand have explicit pedestrian path                                 in green on the left side but you also                                 have the information there is a sidewalk                                 on the runway that's of course only on                                 the outside not on the inside and it's                                 an example where all different methods                                 need we have this micro mapping because                                 we've explicit paths then we have the                                 side for tag and so on and we would like                                 to get everything in there and be able                                 to do some routing on that but do it in                                 a way that we don't have to transform                                 the whole world before so what we are                                 starting with is taking the OSM nodes                                 where all the different lines meet and                                 realize if there is a connection of                                 different roads meeting there then in                                 this case three we create three virtual                                 new nodes actually I drew them a bit                                 apart from the original node but this is                                 not necessary at this point we're just                                 talking about they are other nodes may                                 be very close to the original node                                 because we don't care where exact it                                 exactly is because we're only talking                                 about connectability                                 then we connect these new virtual nodes                                 also with the original node because you                                 might be starting or ending at the                                 original notes and then do we do the                                 same to the outside as well which is                                 still quite locally we also generate the                                 virtual nodes there                                 an important part here is we didn't do                                 anything                                 globally if we add a certain point at                                 this specific point in Karlsruhe if we                                 want to know what notes are around for                                 pedestrians we don't have to look over                                 the whole world and do all different                                 geometric computations there but just                                 work locally in the topological way and                                 create the new notes if we then really                                 want to route there then we think about                                 where is the best place to put the                                 virtual notes but that's just the second                                 part which we can also solve locally so                                 the lookup is just locally and that's                                 why we can do this expansion                                 transparently on live osm data and                                 that's the difference to do to the                                 approach before and why we can directly                                 deliver this and use it everywhere                                 so what we have now is this the                                 resulting path is a detailed roadside                                 aware pedestrian routing we have this                                 virtual path network with all the world                                 sites and crossings and we include all                                 the information that was in the US and                                 before and additional information about                                 which path we are following along and                                 which path we are crossing so we                                 suddenly have more information we can                                 put into our decision which weight to                                 choose so the routing itself the weight                                 the weights are getting much more                                 complicated previa because we have so                                 much more to choose from suddenly this                                 more information and which we can use to                                 provide safe road to reach a road or                                 whatever you can think of of course in                                 the beginning we worked on brought in                                 for blind persons but of course it                                 descends for more so just looking at the                                 benchmark problem before which was                                 yourself without a star we will use the                                 more efficient landmark routing soon you                                 see the the sidewalks were used and the                                 solution identified like before as it is                                 an open street map the traffic lights                                 but then                                 not continuous on the road but uses the                                 sidewalk information before before we                                 had explicit path we walked over the                                 traffic lights and then use the sidewalk                                 of course it depends on the quality but                                 what we try to achieve is to get the                                 best out of the data we have so it's not                                 just theory you can try it for yourself                                 if you go to the website route our goal                                 slash pedestrian routing you can just                                 you get a leaflet map you can click on                                 one point and then click on another                                 point and you get the path that is                                 computed by the system                                 sorry it's limited at the moment for                                 Germany Austria Switzerland it's just                                 it's what the great Gear fabric gives us                                 in a great bundle but it's of course a                                 lot limited to that so we tried it on                                 the ways other places and that's really                                 what we would like to do to extend it to                                 more places and that's something we will                                 do but so far I talked about a technical                                 solution but actually if you want to do                                 routing for humans we have to go even                                 further because there is just not only                                 one pedestrian routing there's hiking                                 there are wheelchairs there are blind                                 pedestrians that the young ones the                                 yellow ones we have various modes of                                 immobility and also might model                                 transportation and all of these                                 different methods have all the distinct                                 needs they have regional regulation laws                                 and habits and also the mapping quality                                 it's different at all different place                                 and offered it for the different modes                                 so for instance I'm so jealous of the                                 bicycles that have explicit paths                                 well it's something we humans with legs                                 or wheelchair we don't have this so                                 often it's mostly more annotation based                                 and so how can we cope with it so the                                 traditional approach is to create a                                 program waiting a programmatic approach                                 for each of these modes and that's my                                 they aren't that many so we talk with                                 experts where should humans walk or                                 blind persons walks we create model all                                 of this and create white box                                 interpretation of this expert knowledge                                 but this also                                 means we have an exit if we've been                                 making assumptions on the representation                                 in the OpenStreetMap and that's by a lot                                 of different approaches before that had                                 solutions for blind people routing said                                 okay you have to change the open                                 statement completely do all these texts                                 in them that we need so we get the best                                 result that won't work it's only a                                 regional solution just as you know micro                                 mapping also only works if you have a                                 group that really wants to support this                                 and do this everywhere but we need a                                 solution for humans that live everywhere                                 so that's quite difficult we and I won't                                 tell you how you should map you try to                                 get the best what do you have there so                                 the problem is either it's quite general                                 or really difficult to update and keep                                 it up keep it to the state we have so                                 that's why I'm proposing that we put in                                 statistical weights based on this                                 annotation combinations we have and this                                 way we can it directly based on the                                 expert knowledge in terms of proposed                                 routes that are given to us and be used                                 as a learning database we are not going                                 to interpret or try to model the OSM to                                 our needs but when we try to identify                                 what's the best way of finding routes                                 that on the one hand fit what the                                 experts say on the other hand works the                                 whole street map v is an automatic and                                 robust pattern recognition while it's                                 machine learning and try to exploit the                                 mapping reality because there's one hand                                 how everyone wants you to do the mapping                                 and the other one how it's being done                                 and that there are regional differences                                 we have to face that and we try to guess                                 get the best of it so it works                                 everywhere so if they are updates to                                 Maps or the OSM gets more accurate and                                 more detailed we try to cope with it by                                 wall night you relearning and most                                 important as there is no human program                                 in this all the time well it's scalable                                 to different kinds of locomotion because                                 if there's an interest group from                                 providing examples where to written how                                 to route we can                                 started learning and find a way to yeah                                 cope with it and get the results people                                 need and of course we would like to use                                 and we will use additional databases                                 like the great accessibility cloud of                                 sociology which provides more                                 information especially for people with                                 yeah blindness or impairment with                                 walking so my closing remarks first of                                 all what you've seen before the solution                                 supporting blind persons in the                                 independent mobility this is something                                 that will be out there soon we will have                                 the roads that we're routing as well as                                 points of interest in the surrounding                                 and computer vision to tell them where                                 there are obstacles but furthermore so                                 if you want to see just get to me after                                 the talk I can give you a live                                 demonstration of it how it looks like                                 right now but overall and what's most                                 important here from the state of the mat                                 we show and that it is feasible to                                 provide routing for true locomotion and                                 human locomotion and also for various                                 modes and that we are robust with                                 respect to various data quality if                                 there's micro mapping or just a very                                 general or even no sidewalk information                                 at all because humans walk on the side                                 of the roads it's scalable and we also                                 try to cope with mapping fallacies or                                 contradictions for example the famous                                 bundling problem is something that's                                 really tedious for us to solve and also                                 I would like to recommend to you to see                                 the talk but Marcus Lukas Smith is the                                 Oh same data model creaking it                                 he really needs hits the Hale on the net                                 on the head what is going wrong and of                                 course if you would like to do                                 pedestrian better have a look at the OSM                                 wiki about the guidelines for best                                 addressed in navigation and well later                                 on the talk about pedestrian route in                                 complex areas so the idea is we were                                 like to get the best out of all the                                 street map for pedestrian routing and I                                 would like to do this with you and I'm                                 open for your questions                                 [Music]                                 the bastion thank you so much for your                                 detailed insight                                 do we have questions over there                                 thank you very much we'll talk a                                 question about the voting expansion you                                 explain so my question is does this go                                 into the computation of the best route                                 already or you are just compute the best                                 route in the traditional way and then                                 say okay I want to find X be the                                 description of the route and if they are                                 the best pedestrian solution                                 thank you her question if I understand                                 it correctly the question was if already                                 the constructor the expansion already is                                 about routing itself and I can tell you                                 it's a great question no we are not                                 doing this we were including all paths                                 may they be reasonable or not and that's                                 also difference to the approach as                                 before because we want to have the new                                 network we are creating independent of                                 the mode of travel year decided to use                                 we think the point way should put all                                 the decision which paths to take or not                                 depending on a condition should be the                                 weighting so if there's a path that                                 doesn't make sense it's get horribly                                 expensive so no one will ever go there                                 but the path is created before                                 independent of which mode of travel you                                 would like to use and in the weighting                                 itself later on it's decided then                                 whether it makes sense or not so there's                                 of course more to decide on but if you                                 use the algorithm with heuristics it                                 doesn't really take you more effort to                                 have them in there apart from RAM usage                                 because it won't take these ways because                                 they are just too expensive up here we                                 have time for one more question but                                 there are five so probably we have to                                 offset a few of them later on I think                                 you were first over there                                 thank you very much I think the dynamic                                 approach is very innovative but what I                                 was wondering when you compare the                                 different pedestrian route services you                                 are looking into pedestrian mode only is                                 this true because the open route service                                 already has a wheelchair route profile                                 that does this extension as you said in                                 the pre-processing step which means that                                 you're right that it needs a lot of                                 additional data to be stored in main                                 memory for that reason the current                                 version is available only for all of                                 Europe but actually depends only on the                                 computer resources to do so the main                                 problem is more the missing data and how                                 clever you generate this additional                                 geometries and we have not published it                                 but it's in done in the background that                                 this data that is used in the yeah about                                 sidewalks and so on is being used also                                 for this wheelchair but then the                                 comparison so to say this probably                                 inside adaptation because it's the                                 crossing of roads and so on is already                                 possible with that approach but as I                                 mentioned with that disadvantage that                                 you need to reprocess it in the four                                 hands yes thank you very much for an                                 idea absolutely right the route service                                 also has a mode to provide pedestrian                                 oten just as we have shown here but it's                                 not a Weibull on the website right away                                 you have to activate the mode and also                                 restrict it in the space and the point I                                 wanted to make is                                 what what is the way but right now                                 because I also mentioned the other                                 solutions and the what other scientists                                 worked on before these ideas work but if                                 they're not available there's a problem                                 with them in this case there's not a                                 problem with them you could enable it at                                 any time but we would like to also think                                 about how do we have to do the waiting                                 and especially just for the blind it's                                 continuously I have to we have to adapt                                 this and work on that so these is this                                 expansion it's just the first step how                                 to use it most efficiently                                 that's next problem we are on because we                                 always find new places where the routing                                 is not that great where we have to                                 change the weights if it's possible to                                 all on the data model and so what we're                                 aiming at is a solution that's a waiver                                 right now in the first step of course                                 for the blind person to use the app but                                 also go further and research and of
