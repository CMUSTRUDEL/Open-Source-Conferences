Title: 2019: Caretography - Mapping Difficult Issues with OpenStreetMap during Difficult Times
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 3, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	We map because we care to represent the world. Yet maps are never "true", they are shaped by their creators and their circumstances. Map-making is world-making: maps by different authors can give access to different worlds. So how can we make, share, and use maps that are created _by_ these worlds, and not just by a privileged few? How can vulnerable communities influence how they’re represented and affected by our maps?

The popular view is that mapping the world is just an act of reflecting reality and reflecting nature. People rely on map-makers like us to show them the “true” spatial arrangement of the world. And yet, making a map also involves making assumptions, omissions, additions, and generalisations, and it feeds on our training, experiences, and personal perspectives as map-makers. A map is never really “true”, it is shaped by the hands of its creators, and it is always also a product of chance and its circumstances of making, sharing, and use. It can be said that map-making is world-making: maps shape our understanding of the world, and inform our actions in the world, and a map by a different author can give access to a different world. So how do we create a map of the world that is created _by_ the world, and not just by a privileged few?

To fully appreciate the complexity of this challenge we need to extend our understanding of what counts as maps and mapping, and why. In order to understand our responsibility as map-makers, we need to become both _critical_ and _caring_ cartographers. This shift in perspectives and attitudes can help us understand better what can happen when our everyday mapping practice connects with real-world circumstances. It may also help us become more responsible as the volunteer workers of OSM.

David and Martin will guide you through a careful and caring consideration of OSM based on personal experiences, and talk about the responsibilities we carry as we map and make the world during difficult times.

For example, we may encounter circumstances where the OpenStreetMap approach to openness brings complications. Can the communities represented on the platform make decisions about how they’re being written about? Indigenous communities around the world regard their land as sacred and don’t want it to be mapped. Should we as a global community know when not to map? There are circumstances where the act of mapping itself can bring danger to the mapper. Do we have the right methods to assess such risks? What support can we offer those who take them? If we don’t, whose hand gets to shape the map instead? And what does all of this this mean for a do-ocracy, where decisions emerge slowly and can often contradict each other? Or to put it even more broadly, how can we diversify, democratise, denaturalise, and decolonise open mapping?

Who cares, you ask? David and Martin have participated in the OSM ecosystem as mappers, researchers, and organisers, and have been involved in the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and other global mapping initiatives. Based on their personal experiences they will introduce you to a careful and caring consideration of OpenStreetMap cartography, and talk about the responsibilities we carry as we map the world. They ask you to consider that maps are not _universal_, and that even in OpenStreetMap many different maps and mappings are possible. They propose that a better map may be a _pluriversal_ one, where many different perspectives can coexist. Can OpenStreetMap accommodate this? Which practices can help us produce maps that represent the world more equitably? More importantly, if we think that mapping can make a difference in a time of global precarity, inequalities, climate catastrophe, and mass extinction, then they ask _you_ to care.

	                              welcome everyone to our next session on                               cartography yeah we're very honored to                               introduce two speakers here to you today                               we got David Garcia I think better known                               as map maker to most of you                               he's yea passionate about hot osm and                               oils geo and very very passionate about                               creating maps as well and he also now                               started researching maps also and the                                use of crowd-sourced geographic                                information for New Zealand specifically                                as he also started his PhD at the                                university of canterbury last year as                                well and he's presenting today with                                martin deters I think also well known to                                our community he did a lot of amazing                                research about hot and the missing maps                                community told us a lot about ourselves                                enabled us to learn a little bit more                                about ourselves how we model what is                                motivating us how we are interacting and                                what kind of impact that has and he now                                works for the Oxford internet Institute                                where he's looking at Wikimedia and the                                Wikimedia community and Wikimedia data                                and most importantly how the knowledge                                that they shared in Wikipedia is                                controlled in who has actually access to                                the knowledge that is presented in the                                key media and he's now also taking this                                conversation further to doors and                                humanity yeah I'm very looking forward                                to hearing more about this we got                                   minutes for the presentations                                         minutes and then                                                   discussion afterwards as well if the                                flood to you                                thank you very much Melanie good morning                                everybody I hope you're well I hope you                                slept well David and I met a few years                                ago at a map of Hong and I I saw him                                present there and I was immediately                                fascinated by his cartography and by his                                way of telling stories about the                                cartographer so we kind of started                                chatting and then we started following                                each other on social media and we now                                live on separate continents but we                                through these kinds of in mutual                                interests that we share we kind of kept                                in touch and then earlier in the year we                                thought because we have kind of                                complementary perspectives on                                OpenStreetMap and on mapping as a                                practice and on online community and                                global communities and so on we thought                                maybe we should try and turn that into a                                talk together and and kind of tell tell                                you about some of the stories that we've                                encountered and we've been we've been                                experiencing so the story that we're                                going to talk about today or the                                not that we're giving you today's when                                one way of describing it could be we                                these are our thoughts about the present                                and about the future of OpenStreetMap                                hello I'm David I make maps and I'm now                                a student and I love OpenStreetMap                                I love tracing coral reefs and this this                                also came out this conversation is also                                about something like there is something                                that we say about what we do we're doing                                we're gonna do this as OpenStreetMap and                                this is what we actually do and this is                                what happens and that's my interest I                                really look for those situations where                                the technology is and its limit order                                surprising ways of using it and as a                                Filipino living in New Zealand I've been                                through disaster or war and now I'm                                interested in indigenous issues because                                I'm kind of in exile there and I have to                                stay there for a while because it's not                                safe in the country so I thought okay                                how do I tell this story because I love                                osm and it's a very my life is very                                meaningful because of of OpenStreetMap                                and I think now that I'm a researcher                                how can I still the contribute                                OpenStreetMap and can kind of be happy                                and finish the PhD and then we talk and                                then over here so thanks for coming                                so as Melanie said my name's Martin                                these days I call myself an accidental                                academic I started out as a software                                developer and in startups and so on and                                then through a few detours ended up                                being being an academic my current job                                title as digital geographer as part of                                 my research in the last few years I                                 spend a lot of time with hot and miss                                 with missing maps and one of the                                 questions in the research that we did                                 together was how do we grow the                                 community so I want to start with with                                 with that I've presented on the on the                                 findings at past that previous hot                                 summits and and state of the maps so I                                 don't want necessarily go into all the                                 details but I want to give you a high                                 level perspective as a starting point                                 and into our talk                                 so the question back then really was we                                 realize realizing that there there are                                 many places in the world there are                                 unmapped so we need as many participants                                 and in the practice of mapping the world                                 as we can now get but we didn't at the                                 time really understand what it was that                                 drove the enthusiasm of mappers or what                                 it was that allowed us to build these                                 these large volunteer communities so in                                 that research we spent looked at a lot                                 of factors that might inform someone's                                 decisions to participate and then to                                 stick around so we looked at task design                                 at the in the tasking manager we looked                                 at mapathon zazz setting as both in                                 terms of the coordination practice but                                 also in terms of the social experience                                 we looked at validator feedback the                                 importance of receiving a feedback once                                 you've contributed again I won't                                 necessarily give you all the details but                                 I really want to give you kind of two                                 broad conclusions that I personally got                                 out of that research the first is about                                 this question of recruiting where do you                                 find us or how do you highly how do you                                 make these mappers so initially I                                 thought my mental model in the beginning                                 was how do we convert someone into a                                 really good mapper so that they they                                 enjoy the practice and they stick around                                 and then and they contribute well and a                                 lot and all these kind of things and                                 over time I realized well maybe that's                                 part of                                 the question maybe also not everybody is                                 going to be interested in mapping and                                 and I think mapathon sand and                                 volunteering as a model form for mapping                                 as a kind of context for mapping as                                 opposed to you mapping your neighborhood                                 volunteering for a social cause really                                 Illustrated that to me because through                                 hots through missing maps and and                                 organizations like that a lot of a lot                                 more people got exposed to the mapping                                 practice and largely what we found many                                 people who start doing that don't                                 necessarily stick around even though                                 they might maybe appreciate the initial                                 experience I think in the end this                                 question of what would make someone stay                                 this is really also a question about the                                 person it's really a question about what                                 is what are they interested in what do                                 they gain what what do they get                                 enjoyment out of also do they find a                                 social setting in which they're they're                                 comfortable so broadly speaking for me                                 that now means maybe it's not really a                                 question of converting someone into a                                 mapper but maybe it's a question of                                 giving everybody an opportunity and and                                 when that happens to give them the                                 support but also accepting that not                                 everybody is going to to keep doing that                                 and so one of the things we learned                                 through the map of thoughts is one of                                 the key ways of of doing that is to have                                 regular mapping activities that are                                 public that are open that are announced                                 in advance so maybe that people know                                 every first Wednesday of the month I can                                 go there these kind of things and we saw                                 that really drove in in London and in                                 other places that really drove growth in                                 the community the other really important                                 lesson we learned is about feedback it's                                 also something that came as a bit of a                                 surprise to me that we looked at as one                                 of the studies we looked at a validator                                 feedback what happens when people                                 contribute for the first time through                                 the tasking manager or maybe at a mapper                                 phone maybe at home and then a validator                                 looks at their work and then sends them                                 a message and then valid marks the task                                 as validated or kind of sends it back to                                 four or four corrections and we largely                                 found to my surprise that it doesn't                                 seem to be that bad to be told that you                                 did you made some mistakes there                                 and many other online communities and                                 Wikipedia Stack Overflow and many other                                 places where people get rated for their                                 contributions a negative rating can be                                 really detrimental to motivations                                 because it feels like a public shaming                                 validated feedback is private so you                                 don't feel shamed when when a validator                                 tells you are here is it how you can do                                 better next time                                 I think it is important that how the                                 validator communicates that what what                                 kind of type of message they send                                 another thing we found is that something                                 that is incredibly powerful for the                                 motivation or the decision to stick                                 around is to say simply say thanks or to                                 simply be appreciative of the                                 contribution for many people who                                 contributed online maybe the validator                                 feedback is the first time they have a                                 social encounter with another person in                                 an open street map context so it because                                 suddenly it becomes really important                                 what that person tells you and I think                                 for many people it's incredibly                                 meaningful to then be told                                 thank you your contribution is as                                 meaningful to us and you helped us                                 advances further so rather rather than                                 thinking of it in terms of our kind of                                 writing system or or yeah as it is                                 around many other platforms here I think                                 it's closer to the mentoring system and                                 I think that's quite important                                 interesting so many many more details I                                 put last week I published in my                                 OpenStreetMap diarrhea published a                                 summary of the research you can go there                                 or the links to the papers and so on now                                 I'm a digital geographer at the Oxford                                 internet Institute I work with this guy                                 here Marc Ram is a geographer he's done                                 lots of interesting research in the past                                 and he's an information geographer so                                 with him I do information geography so                                 where geography maybe might ask is there                                 a castle in this place is there a                                 mountain in this place information                                 geography asks is this castle on                                 OpenStreetMap is this mountain on                                 OpenStreetMap so a few years ago Mark                                 and his colleagues made this map which                                 many of you might might have seen                                 already this is the contents density on                                 OpenStreetMap if we take all the nodes I                                 believe in data or knots or                                 OpenStreetMap                                 on a map of the world and we draw that                                 as a heat map then we find that                                 well OpenStreetMap at the time I think                                 that's                                                               different but back in                                                 was kind of mapping the world but really                                 there's a lot of emphasis on Europe and                                 North America Japan and some other                                 corners of the world at large places in                                 the world we're not on map in my current                                 work I also look at Wikipedia and                                 Wikipedia you see a very similar kind of                                 distribution this again is an old map                                 that's from                                                              much better but there you'll also see                                 the similar kind of emphasis on Europe                                 and North America and a certain certain                                 countries in East and South Asia as on                                 Australia but many other parts of the                                 world that were at the time we're not                                 really represented on Wikipedia so in my                                 current work are partially I'm trying to                                 understand why is that why do we see                                 these kinds of imbalances of                                 representation the fact that certain                                 parts of the world are represented on                                 these platforms and others aren't and                                 there are many factors I mean in fact it                                 would be a whole separate talk to go                                 into all the details but I think one of                                 one one of the foundational elements                                 that is also quite intuitive for us to                                 understand a lot of it at the time also                                 had to do with connectivity can people                                 how easily can people go online so this                                 something does not rapidly changing                                 because in many parts of the world                                 connectivity is getting cheaper and more                                 affordable with smartphones and all                                 these kind of things so so this is a                                 these are now old numbers by the thing                                 is quite striking a striking way to                                 illustrate that again a map produced by                                 Mark and his colleagues this is the cost                                 of broadband connectivity relative to                                 the monthly average salary and once you                                 compare it in this way you see that                                 there are parts in the world where                                 broadband costs more than the monthly                                 average salary I think that is quite                                 striking here we don't I'm European we                                 don't think twice about having two three                                 types of connection I have my cell phone                                 I've brought man at home my employer has                                 broadband so there are many places for                                 me to to be connected and there are many                                 parts in the world it's getting better                                 rapidly in Africa and other places India                                 also is now much more connected than it                                 was                                          but but still fundamentally it's a case                                 brought connectivity is not equal                                 equally distributed and as a result we                                 see that not only is representation of                                 the world unequally distributed not only                                 is Africa for example not as well mapped                                 as Europe it's also who makes these                                 representations is unequally distributed                                 so this here is a map of Wikipedia and                                 is asking the question who in the world                                 is able to create their own Wikipedia                                 articles about their own places so to                                 the this shows the extent to which                                 articles about countries in Africa have                                 been written about people from these                                 countries or articles about places in                                 Europe have been written about people                                 from these countries with we can do that                                 easily in open and Wikipedia because the                                 IP addresses of anonymity of anonymous                                 editors are in the public editor history                                 with OpenStreetMap it would be more                                 challenging to to show that and again                                 you see we see there many places in the                                 world where people don't write their own                                 Wikipedia articles but instead they're                                 being written about by others to their                                 big credit the Wikipedia community is                                 really switched on and they they're now                                 putting a lot of effort into into                                 addressing this issue and in fact                                 they've recognized it as a social                                 injustice they see this is that this is                                 the result of a structural inequality is                                 an imbalance in opportunity and they are                                 now putting a lot of resources a lot of                                 time a lot of effort into addressing                                 this and in fact they made if part of                                 their strategy for the coming years is                                 one of the central goals for the                                 Wikimedia Foundation and the Wikipedia                                 community as a whole is it's a concept                                 that they call knowledge equity which is                                 essentially the the value that they now                                 hold high to say that the people who are                                 being written about on Wikipedia should                                 be participating in those                                 representations they should be making                                 and be able to make decisions about how                                 their community is how their places are                                 being represented on Wikipedia so this                                 an open street map from the beginning we                                 had this question of local knowledge                                 which is part of that                                 but I think the next step from there                                 what what what the notion of local                                 knowledge does not quite already                                 articulate is also the question and at                                 the moment not everybody has an equal                                 opportunity to participate so I think                                 from an OpenStreetMap perspective this                                 is an interesting step to take and as a                                 result Wikipedia is they're very active                                 very globally active community like the                                 opposite mob community so there are                                 hundreds initiatives of initiatives to                                 address systemic biases one of the                                 challenges is that there are many                                 unexpected barriers to participation so                                 I mentioned one in this connectivity                                 another one is the fact that the the the                                 the capacity to participate to make time                                 available to participate is not equally                                 distributed last year I was at wiki                                 mania in Cape Town which is global                                 gathering of the Wikipedia community                                 where in a Q&A session and African                                 editor stood up and said so hold on                                 you're asking us to contribute our                                 knowledge for free people here can't                                 afford to donate their time so she was                                 wasn't long she was a very active                                 Wikimedia and Wikipedia and so she she                                 was not it was a bit of a rhetorical                                 provocation in that in that moment but I                                 thought it was a very nice way of                                 illustrating an additional barrier of                                 participation if you're interested in                                 that there's an article that that mark                                 and me put on a wired where we tell that                                 story with a bit more more detail but                                 largely speaking the the the the summary                                 is this capacity to volunteer to donate                                 our time to OpenStreetMap to Wikipedia                                 is not globally Universal and in fact                                 it's if we look at it from a global                                 perspective it's kind of an exception                                 which also means that I've been looking                                 at hot sand and a missing map from a                                 European perspective from a North                                 American perspective with marathons                                 volunteering settings and so on most                                 likely my research does not translate to                                 many places in the world this also means                                 that community mapping which is the                                 thing that we are doing also most likely                                 because of that looks quite different in                                 different places in the world and it                                 also means that one of the one of the                                 surprising powers of OpenStreetMap and                                 of hot and organisations like them                                 is there in fact they are part of a                                 global volunteer force I'm a part of a                                 global community community and part of                                 an open-source community and all the                                 things but I think they are very                                 importantly we also have to recognize                                 they're part of a global employment                                 network and it is just as important as                                 all the other parts because this is one                                 of the ways in which many parts of the                                 world can participate in the creation of                                 maps that otherwise could not so all of                                 these are kind of steps or kind of                                 perspectives on trying to understand                                 what are the limitations of this model                                 of contributing to OpenStreetMap what                                 what are things that maybe look the same                                 around the world maybe aren't there                                 there are other questions we could look                                 at so a long-running question in the                                 OpenStreetMap community particularly in                                 the hub community what do we do about                                 vulnerable communities sometimes being                                 maps also exposes you to risk how do we                                 deal with sacred knowledge their                                 communities in the world who don't want                                 certain knowledge to me right public                                 there's there's a language barrier                                 um I was talking event from                                 OpenStreetMap India the other day and he                                 had a very nice example of the language                                 barrier this OpenStreetMap the the main                                 sites about India is everything is                                 labeled in English the English is spoken                                 in India but only                                                     the countries speak it there depending                                 on how you count their                                             languages in India about                                               in India so they would one language for                                 one country would not make sense and                                 that's in that situation so as a                                 response OpenStreetMap India is now                                 experimenting with bike vector tiles                                 which allows one of the issues with with                                 language selection on OpenStreetMap is                                 it requires terabytes of space to to                                 store all the tiles and if you were to                                 offer multiple language version based on                                 the raster it would it would be become                                 incredibly expensive but vector Charles                                 one of the surprising side effects of                                 offering vector tiles as a way of                                 displaying the map is it allows dynamic                                 kind of                                 adjustments like localization so                                 OpenStreetMap India is now play                                 experimenting with vector tiles where                                 any selector a language selector they                                 don't it's there they have a first set                                 of languages and I imagine they're                                 they're just going to expand that in                                 order to address the language barrier so                                 let's say the idea editor was an                                 important credibly important technology                                 to make it easy for newcomers to                                 contribute to OpenStreetMap I think                                 vector Charles maybe so surprisingly                                 will be an incredibly important                                 technology for the world to be able to                                 consume the map in their language                                 appropriately for their context so for                                 me as a technologist the my journey over                                 the last ten years was has been a kind                                 of a process of unlearning of realizing                                 me as a European as a as a computer                                 scientist and so on I have a particular                                 perspective but there are many things in                                 the worlds that I don't actually see and                                 yet I'm as a software developer I am                                 being asked to write software for the                                 world so the journey for me over the                                 last                                                                     really I can't because the assumption                                 that we're usually making as                                 technologists that we build one                                 technology one software one platform one                                 mapping process one editor for all of                                 the world something that is universal                                 this may be actually not that useful and                                 maybe there's a kind of post-colonial                                 term which I think is very useful in the                                 business context maybe what we should                                 actually be striving for is something                                 that is pure reversal because it is not                                 one world that looks the same everywhere                                 it's actually in fact many worlds many                                 circumstances many capacities many                                 different needs they all coexist at the                                 same time so the fascinating thing about                                 OpenStreetMap for me as a as a                                 phenomenon as a movement as a community                                 as a set of technologies and so on is                                 that we quite mature now after after                                    years and we've come really far but yet                                 we are still regularly finding us                                 ourselves in situations where we are                                 running out of understanding of how to                                 do this well I think                                 that the general aspiration of                                 OpenStreetMap which I would articulate                                 as a map for the world built on local                                 knowledge driven by a global community I                                 think that is that is a very there's                                 very nice vision and I think what what I                                 wanted to express and then I think what                                 I'm also getting from from from the                                 conversation that I've been having over                                 the last few months we will still it                                 still brings us back to these questions                                 how do we do it as well okay that's it                                 for me I'm going to hand over to David                                 and then in the end we'll come together                                 again thanks Marty oh my so nervous okay                                 hello everyone I'd like first of all I'd                                 like to ask who's an indigenous person                                 in the room I also think that's a                                 problem and maybe we can work on that                                 another I'd like to thank everyone who                                 was the reason why I'm here a long way                                 for me to participate in my first State                                 of the map you wouldn't believe me how                                 how I got theirs I think my friends                                 co-workers people of Aotearoa New                                 Zealand who funded my scholarship my mom                                 she paid for the ticket this is for you                                 Bob I participated in osm and my life                                 gets mini because of osm right now I'm a                                 PhD student                                 I'm writing a sari it's a personal one                                 and this is the title how to map an                                 island in the Pacific                                 I make nice maps this is kind of my                                 daily therapy and these are the samples                                 this is where I live on the Left it's                                 out your OVA also known as New Zealand                                 but this is where I came from                                 it's Philippine seven thousand six                                 hundred forty one Islands it's a Cebu                                 tefillin that we place at the same time                                 there's a popular saying in our place                                 especially in the Pacific cultures if                                 you want to know where you're going then                                 you should know where you came from and                                 this is our story the story of the                                 Pacific people's they migrated it from                                 Southeast Asia before the others did the                                 rest for China nice we settled the ocean                                 well before the European state and this                                 is a forgotten story that you should                                 know we were there first and our                                 knowledge of series including this                                 knowledge this is a map it doesn't have                                 boundaries                                 the shells represent islands and the six                                 represent the ocean swells the                                 relationships between the islands and                                 our ancestors use this for every voyage                                 and felt the waves and use the Stars and                                 it's a different world view it's not a                                 polygon it's not a vector tile and it's                                 embody this is also where I came from                                 when the volcano exploded in our town in                                                                                                       our life was very difficult at the same                                 day there was a typhoon so we were very                                 lucky the largest eruption of the past                                 three decades and a type one at the same                                 time our towns robbery and left well                                 life was kind of difficult and then I                                 went to college where I lived in a slum                                 for about seven years and I learned                                 mapping there because you're addressing                                 disasters like this one this happened                                 today                                                                  Ondoy and I don't see the slides here                                 but this is this is also part of my osm                                 journey because this is how I learned                                 how to make maps we were making maps                                 with indigenous peoples in the upland                                 and try to understand the floods and                                 when this typhoon in                                                     was the strongest cyclone to make                                 landfall in global history by then and                                 this is how it looked like this is in                                 Tacloban                                 incidentally it's it was the same place                                 where friend out the Miguel Miguel EIS                                 or Ferdinand de magallanes when they                                 were circumnavigating the world they                                 arrived in the Philippines here's it so                                 globally important historically                                 important place                                 the sad part is a thousands of people                                 died so one week before the typhoon                                 there is a group of OpenStreetMap                                 volunteers and they said hey David                                 there's a typhoon coming it's a week                                 from now we know where the path is we                                 need to make maps and there's this thing                                 called a map a pod and we need to do                                 this so the responders can can can do                                 their job and I was I was a journey                                 instructor in a GIS laboratory in the                                 university okay how do I do this well                                 okay this is the door use use of                                 computers and everyone was doing this                                 for for couple of months and if you                                 helped us and you're a part of this I'd                                 like to thank you very much                                 this is the result the before and after                                 in                                 and this was very useful because we had                                 to understand the places where the                                 recovery was going to happen I and I                                 eventually left the University and                                 became a humanitarian worker for example                                 this is the the destroyed Beach and                                 that's where the soil was and the winds                                 were so strong that that piece of food                                 wasn't there before the typhoon so back                                 then it's in there you were killed by                                 the waves are killed by the strong winds                                 pick your choice choose between the two                                 I'll focus on this island and I love it                                 very much                                 it's called victory island even after                                 the disaster government was evicting                                 them for for some weird reason but it's                                 a very beautiful place in the middle of                                 a reef and I just finished tracing the                                 reef recently it's very wonderful this                                 is how it looks like in OpenStreetMap                                 but the sad part is that in government                                 maps it's just a coral so OpenStreetMap                                 was very instrumental in in addressing                                 that special injustice there are                                     people there they lost their relatives                                 the bodies were never found and they're                                 not even on the map so we use open                                 street map to map with the communities                                 and not for the communities and we found                                 out that in the process of the                                 participatory mapping that they've been                                 living there for                                                      been reclaiming the island with with                                 trash                                 and it looks like this and for me                                 OpenStreetMap was a way for us to help                                 understand your situation so ok we made                                 maps to them and because there's no                                 internet no no smartphone there no no                                 internet access no a lack of electricity                                 we made paper maps and laminated them                                 and put them in tarpaulin because                                 there's a lot of rain and it's a high                                 entropy environment and talked about the                                 evacuation recovery etc for about a year                                 we stayed there for for quite some time                                 I even became a judge of a local beauty                                 pageant in the process and then the year                                 in the year after there's another                                 typhoon                                 it came to the same area and gladly no                                 one no one died because people                                 understood the maps they were part of                                 the making of the map we were not just                                 making maps for them but with them and I                                 think maybe that made all the difference                                 so the missing maps                                 and then the because the job contracts                                 with an international and named the                                 international agency were very short I                                 had to get the scholarship the contacts                                 were just three months short and then I                                 got a scholarship to UCL and I met                                 missing maps and that's where                                 OpenStreetMap happened spent the year                                 there try to educate myself once more                                 because there after I went back to the                                 Philippines and I went to a city called                                 Bowie with with a group with the team                                 because Isis and the government were                                 fighting months before and we were                                 tracing buildings things or some                                 Philippines and others so that recovery                                 and the construction can can be we can                                 help in that this is for a photo I took                                 inside the the war zone and it's a very                                 very important experience for me so                                 again with when an urban planner had in                                 a GIS person had I tried to but we tried                                 to facilitate something this is also                                 part of this story because there are                                 moments during that exercise when I as a                                 specialist wanted to do the same thing                                 that we did in the typhoon moment okay                                 let's finish the map let's make the GIS                                 files very very clean good projection                                 the topologies clip and and fit and the                                 cadastral files are clean but then the                                 participants only well and some of them                                 are almost crying during the activity                                 they said well they with if you talk                                 about this you know our clan members are                                 fighting and they there are disputes                                 over the land if you push this too far I                                 don't think we will produce peace so at                                 that moment I thought well am i                                 mapmaking or our peacemaking                                 and maybe there are moments when the                                 right thing to do is to not make a map                                 and to just listen and then we were also                                 doing this at the same time this is kind                                 of relate that you're mapping human                                 rights violations under the current                                 government but it became very dangerous                                 and surveillance and all of that great                                 stuff so I went to New Zealand to start                                 a PhD we're kind of ok this is a safe                                 space and then I've been thinking ok                                 what am I gonna do now I I still                                 remember this phrase it's very important                                 for me if you want to know where you're                                 going you should remember where you came                                 from so I tried to go back to the basic                                 OS and                                 with these try to trace sweeps that's                                 hard shape that's very nice                                 it's fun during lunch I also make one                                 map every day using opposite map data                                 and blender and use the the polygons                                 there operate open street map                                 contributors and also participate in in                                 hot especially every Friday during                                 excavations because I'd like to give                                 back because you helped us in the                                 Philippines and I really feel the need                                 that I should I should give back I'm                                 becoming part of this community too and                                 we're inviting you to Wellington in                                 November for our own shine a conference                                 because it's gonna be fun it's the                                 second one and now an hour here now I'm                                 here in front of you I like this image                                 that the monkey with the mirror because                                 there's something written in the website                                 and it's very important too and it's sad                                 it holds a mirror to remind anyone                                 crossing the bridge they look back from                                 where they came from and remember                                 remember who they are                                 there's popular thing in the Pacific if                                 you want to know where you're going then                                 you should know where it came from                                 because I'm kind of lost right now I                                 went back to the Philippines last August                                 or July I went back to the typhoon zone                                 in the war zone and I tried to remember                                 ok David why are you doing this why are                                 you mapping and you know it's very                                 existential and I've also been trying to                                 study Pacific cultures event Oxford last                                 July and by accident there's a display                                 this was our display our the charts the                                 ocean charts of our Pacific ancestors                                 the sad part is these these treasures                                 are not in the hands of Pacific people's                                 most of them are here in in Germany and                                 maybe the sad part is besides this image                                 there's apparition there's there's a                                 description it says it means something                                 like this this was an Oxford last July                                 and I found it by accident                                 he said the Pacific navigation                                 traditions decline in response to the                                 European colonization of the Pacific I                                 said ok maybe that's an honest telling                                 but then well yeah it's not just in                                 response to but because of because we                                 lost lands we lost labor lost our lives                                 even lost knowledge and now we can even                                 read the stories                                 does this kind of triggered another                                 thought process so what now again what                                 does it mean for us in the Pacific and                                 I've been thinking well it's obviously                                 map gonna be another story of an                                 outsider discovering us discovery if you                                 look at osm we've been trying to avoid                                 that to be very very honest and him very                                 thing for this movement on the left is a                                 painting in Hammond in Frankfort it's                                 nearby it's called the geographer by                                 Johannes Vermeer it's a very beautiful                                 one it's a it's but it's a plastic image                                 of this you know this sense rational map                                 maker geographer drawing other places                                 this explore discovered the world but he                                 doesn't really understand the lives of                                 the people he's mapping and he's a he                                 and we should be thankful and he is the                                 hero so I thought well what does this                                 mean for us and then this is this image                                 were in mana we're a work worthy are we                                 gonna leave this model on the left and                                 go to the right and have a more diverse                                 community because I think it's not just                                 the maps that are missing the map makers                                 are missing too and also they're missing                                 stories about the mapping time we should                                 tell more of that so I'm not making any                                 Universal claim your honor I don't want                                 to fight but I think these are things                                 that we should ponder on because again                                 going from the quote earlier I think for                                 us if about the point that there is that                                 there's no indigenous person in this                                 room if the day will come that if you                                 wanted the a day to come when there will                                 be a person right here an indigenous                                 person and that person loves of a street                                 map how can we make that happen how can                                 we become a good opposite map as a star                                 because other awesome volunteers are                                 also good ancestors to me they helped in                                 the London marathons                                 they showed me how to do it and                                 obviously map doing hand I asked for                                 help during though in the war zone and                                 it did that so I think we need we need                                 to continue doing that and what I'm                                 learning so far is                                 is this that in OpenStreetMap we each of                                 us kind of pays attention to a different                                 thing more some of us be attached to the                                 accuracy and availability others okay                                 let's meet this I make it accessible or                                 no I'm gonna teach students make them                                 more able the ability and there are some                                 of us or focus on the ethics and the                                 haunt ability and and it's all wonderful                                 and it makes makes me reflect about                                 these points something like okay for for                                 us to have a better movement maybe let's                                 see the world from another volunteers                                 ice maybe that that will help a lot and                                 I really like this this this part the                                 third question what if there are time                                 situations or moments when the right                                 thing to do is to not may come up and to                                 step back and do not be the hero and to                                 let another person take the map and run                                 with it I'm stealing a hold from                                 computer to dress a very nice way to do                                 a literature review it's very nice right                                 we don't have to be a voice for the                                 voiceless sometimes we just need to pass                                 the mic so I leave you with this message                                 maybe it's not just about hashtag bridge                                 the map maybe it's also time to the pass                                 the map thank you very much                                 [Applause]                                 this guy's making me cry every time he                                 speaks so we we felt in addition to tell                                 you these stories we thought you should                                 also try and find a way to kind of find                                 find some kind of essence and find find                                 some kinds of core learnings for us that                                 we that we want to share with you and I                                 think one of the things that has been                                 coming clear to both of us through                                 through this work is that while it's                                 it's a novel aim to have one map of the                                 world it might be an impossibility and                                 in fact maybe we should not even try to                                 do that try to force that to happen and                                 in fact maybe the question is more how                                 can we have multiple maps of the world                                 coexist there there are different ways                                 of thinking about it conceptually I                                 talked about it I once already described                                 as a notion of vertical maps of kind of                                 vertical realities that scan towards us                                 and the question then it also is like                                 what feeds into this map and what makes                                 that map exist and and I think David                                 articulates us really well and is also                                 part of our responsibility of mappers                                 it's also also to recognize that                                 sometimes it should not be me who draws                                 that part who makes that particular map                                 and sometimes it should be someone who                                 has a different kind of experience or an                                 experience of that place that I don't                                 have I think also as a social space for                                 hot that there's equally true that                                 sometimes it should not be me who                                 coordinates the initiative or who                                 organizes the events or who is the                                 keynote speaker and sometimes it should                                 be someone else or someone with someone                                 who's the board member or any any of                                 those and any of those roles yep                                 I'd like to do touch on this points two                                 and three this is just very obvious                                 because I think in the in the GIS                                 literature for the for the guys kicks                                 out here OpenStreetMap is called crowds                                 since state the collection but the more                                 I say in the movement this is a lot of                                 work                                 this is labored and takes time and                                 course and you need to emphasize that                                 it's not just crowdsourcing this is                                 called work and that's very important                                 and the connection to that we want to                                 recognize the wide range of labor that                                 goes behind the making of the map so the                                 mapathon happens because someone bought                                 the pizza and the beers and we'll talk                                 to the sponsor someone tweeted about it                                 and people invited young people and they                                 might not they're volunteers here or we                                 don't have a high number of changes and                                 then the edits but they do all of that                                 labor just so that the mapping it                                 happened so I'd like to encourage you to                                 think about that in our that                                 relationship to improve our relationship                                 with the people who might not have the                                 time to have                                                             but they they work behind the scenes to                                 make that happen                                 that's for point number three number                                 four - I I'll pass I'll mention this now                                 maybe we can all spread I scare whatever                                 whatever that means                                 me as a neurodiverse person sometimes my                                 hand shakes and it was very nice because                                 whenever there was an activation and it                                 can't participate Russ or Rebecca says                                 well yeah make some time how are you                                 that's very nice                                 and my question there is okay who cares                                 for the people who care we should also                                 ask about them and for me that also                                 resonates because as part of doing this                                 work over the last few years I also                                 sometimes took on too much and more and                                 more than I should and in in the final                                 stages of my PhD I had my first ever and                                 hopefully only ever panic attack which                                 was a circumstance where I was on three                                 deadlines on five projects and had                                 finished some but there is seemed like a                                  never-ending thing and I received an                                  email by someone who was talking about a                                  project that I thought we had finished                                  and they had an additional request can                                  we refine this and so on which in                                  principle is nice but in that moment I                                  panicked and it remembers staring at my                                  screen and and and physically being                                  unable to respond and I recognized                                  but what I was just going through it I                                  realize what the only thing I need to do                                  right now is close my laptop and and go                                  on a long walk and to me that there was                                  a there was a wake-up call and made me                                  realize that this this question of care                                  is essential when we care about the work                                  and when we put effort behind the work                                  and maybe ambitious and and and when we                                  feel the urgency maybe also sometimes of                                  the situation that we also recognize the                                  first loyalty that we should have is to                                  ourselves and and to the people around                                  us and we should support them in that                                  journey and I think that's really                                  important something to that this is a                                  very important moment so last March                                     the crisis tears of that happened near                                  where I live but the miracle of the                                  moment I suppose was the first folks who                                  asked are you okay David was obviously                                  people and we said hey I refined few                                  minutes after that and for me that's                                  that's that's wonderful now okay next                                  how are we for time we have got many                                  stories where we're now we've been up                                  wondering how much how much detail we                                  cannot go into oh you already know it's                                  good it's good we've got we should close                                  in around                                                          minutes per discussions now as well okay                                  let's listen maybe very briefly touch                                  over the last two points and then and                                  then we couldn't we couldn't jump to                                  questions so one of the things that                                  again would be kind of its own talk but                                  we touched on it in a number of                                  different races I think one of the                                  things that for OpenStreetMap and for                                  hot and organizations like them could be                                  really useful is to find ways of                                  codifying our understanding of our                                  responsibilities as mappers but I                                  noticed in some of the projects I was                                  involved in outside of OpenStreetMap                                  that but that had to do with geo data                                  and so on                                  is is that sometimes you will be given                                  professional opportunities to do work                                  where you're not entirely sure how to                                  assess can I do this responsibly and I                                  was in one of those circumstances and I                                  realized my professional training had                                  not prepared me to answer really that                                  question and thankfully I was surrounded                                  by people who I could see get guidance                                  from and in the end in this particular                                  circumstance I ended up declining                                  the job but I really recognized at the                                  moment we often we don't know how to                                  assess should we be doing those so I                                  think OpenStreetMap and hearts and                                  organizations like them they should have                                  a professional code like a code of of                                  mapper ethics or whatever you might want                                  to call it the basic set of principles                                  that allow us to as practitioners as                                  markers to assess how we can be                                  responsible in our activity mmm I'll                                  mention the last one briefly so when I                                  was racing indigenous issues concerns I                                  thought well I'm gonna lead the project                                  David are there gonna be the person but                                  this is not me I am NOT an indigenous                                  person I am a Filipino national a nice                                  Philippine national but I am NOT an                                  indigenous person trying hard to be an                                  ally I think so our worried relatives in                                  the Pacific but I'm not an indigenous                                  person in this is why I put that last                                  point here I dream of a day when there's                                  someone and the bar was an indigenous                                  person because that's very important                                  someone who embodies the experience who                                  really understands what it's like to do                                  for you to lose your land because                                  someone drew a map that's very important                                  for us because now I was thinking in                                                                                                           our family we thought you were the good                                  guys                                  what's gonna happen so imagine that no                                  will it be different or will it be like                                  right now how can you be a good                                  OpenStreetMap ancestor thank you that's                                  it well maybe as a last word I think                                  it's likely that we don't want to leave                                  you on a dark note as I was not the                                  intention of the talk I think in all                                  this throughout all these experiences                                  it's also important to acknowledge and                                  to recognize that contributing to                                  OpenStreetMap is an incredibly joyful                                  experience and it is because we get to                                  meet people like you and we get to meet                                  each other I get to be friends with                                  David so otherwise I would never have                                  met and and I deeply admired the guy and                                  my life is enriched because of it and                                  and maybe sometimes that makes you look                                  at the world differently and I think                                  fundamentally that's that's what we're                                  talking about                                  and sometimes less is hard and sometimes                                  it's joyful and both kind of coexist                                  thank you                                  [Applause]                                  great yeah thank you so much I think                                  yeah we could talk alright yeah listen                                  to you talk or what a whole afternoon                                  actually but yeah yeah we're you're                                  still around today as well and we got                                  now                                  yeah around                                                         discussion are there any questions                                  Jennifer yep all right thank you very                                  much that was absolutely brilliant I                                  wondered I totally agree that we should                                  be trying to put marginalized                                  communities and individuals in the                                  center and I but I wondered if you                                  thought that that we are somehow                                  OpenStreetMap is going away from that by                                  the influence of big corporates mapping                                  activities and I also thought do you                                  think we as we have a responsibility not                                  to be working with authoritarian regimes                                  that are actually working against                                  indigenous people perhaps I'm thinking                                  particularly in the in places like the                                  Philippines I think I think the the                                  question like when what I've been                                  learning for me a good illustration of                                  this is the Facebook automated imports                                  where where I think the fear that I'm                                  hearing that you're articulating is the                                  fear of a large powerful organization                                  that kind of takes over and I think the                                  Facebook journey really illustrates to                                  me how even if it starts out in a way                                  that would tell us many babies not as it                                  should have started out in the end I                                  think the the the the circumstances we                                  finding it ourselves and now this these                                  imports are organized now we're in in                                  fact it's now communities and organizers                                  who are in charge of saying this is                                  where we want the support of the machine                                  but fundamentally is so organized and                                  coordinated by humans so I think that's                                  an illustration of I think the best                                  possible outcome and in any one of those                                  circumstances where we initially we                                  might be concerned about an imbalance of                                  capacity or an imbalance of power I                                  think the real strength of OpenStreetMap                                  as an ecosystem is that we we work                                  through in part                                  through discourse that someone proposes                                  something in someone else response and                                  then we have a dialogue and then out of                                  that ultimately the outcome emerges and                                  I think that's really powerful I have a                                  quick answer the part about the                                  authoritarian regimes I really can't the                                  treating varies part about working with                                  corporates this is a very personal                                  observation the people I worked with in                                  the in the war zone in the disaster zone                                  when our contracts and they're very                                  employed by corporates that's how they                                  can continue to become osm volunteer so                                  they still do the volunteering organize                                  things we had an open street map Cape                                  during the                                                             time that was fun                                  but they have to pay the bills and they                                  have children and there were someone to                                  pay them to do over sell so I don't know                                  if that's a normative statement or not                                  but that's that's what's happening Janet                                  thank you for the more questions yeah                                  vomit thanks Rob                                  well you made a very good point that we                                  should pay the contributors I believe                                  totally that in this world where one of                                  the functional fuel is money you cannot                                  run an engine that solidly works on                                  motivation and recognition I mean you                                  need to bring something which is more                                  tangible so keeping that in mind how do                                  you see value propagation should take                                  place which is a monopoly independent                                  and which is being driven by the                                  protocol I don't know or how that should                                  work I mean so that the contributor                                  should make something like which is he                                  wish he can he or she can touch I don't                                  know this is well how do you how do you                                  perceive this situation like you have a                                  picture in mind in that direction or                                  so it's the acoustics in this room are                                  quite bad it was quite quite hard to                                  understand your question but so yeah in                                  part you're asking about the question of                                  labor and then payment yes yeah but I'm                                  not totally I would I don't believe in                                  like wage kind of system but rather                                  value value that's a contributor has                                  general value and how it should come                                  back to him that is more tangible so the                                  question in part is the question of                                  incentivization right what what what                                  yeah how should we reward contribution                                  NZ will do more you mean like mana in                                  simple words yeah it's quite a                                  complicated question I say any other                                  thing so thank you for asking my                                  question because it remains unanswered                                  like fundamentally there is not a                                  straightforward question to answer you                                  can look at it from the perspective of                                  motivational psychology which was my                                  original research looking at what drives                                  mappers and and there we largely find                                  that in volunteering settings people                                  kind of have their own motivations and                                  they they get their own enjoyment out of                                  the practice and you don't need to give                                  them candy in order to keep them around                                  in fact just make sure that there are no                                  barriers to participation and for them                                  that's already has value and and and                                  often as valuing has a kind of reward in                                  itself and when you then start                                  introducing payment that's actually                                  often discouraging like volunteering and                                  payment does not really easily get along                                  and in fact often it's it's it's it's                                  quite powerful yeah but mass adoption is                                  also one of the requirement okay well so                                  that was the first part in the second                                  part is the the reason why this                                  challenge because this does not apply to                                  all the world circumstances and all the                                  individual circumstances and for some                                  people the question is not how can I                                  volunteer my time but the question is                                  like how can I earn how can I again                                  market employment skills how can I                                  advance myself personally and                                  professionally how can i educate myself                                  in a way that maybe it allows me to                                  build a better future for my family how                                  can I respond to circumstances in my                                  community                                  that we are affected by and what what                                  active steps can I take all these kind                                  of things and top of that how do I pay                                  my rent                                  yeah while doing that I'd like to add to                                  that kind of a counterpoint to what I                                  said about employment I also recognize                                  that's the sheer pleasure of making a                                  map piece for the craft mappers out here                                  that's very important you're not paid                                  you know you just enjoy it and we just                                  have to recognize that that lutely                                  that there's inherent value in that in                                  itself you're nothing of any purpose I'm                                  just this a nice polygon and I close it                                  and in fact it feels right mmm as basic                                  as that so I think largely what we're                                  trying also trying to say is I don't                                  think there is one way of rewarding all                                  OpenStreetMap matters I think there are                                  many ways and they're all kind of thick                                  also varies by the person people                                  different people might go for different                                  things doesn't answer your question                                  thank you yeah I think versity hello                                  okay yeah you raised a number of good                                  points in saying that yeah I remember                                  one thing that you mentioned there might                                  be for example holy sites should we map                                  them in how far we do we need to respect                                  local customs and so on in a larger                                  pulling that up a bit                                  many wars have been fought on the planet                                  about people thinking that they have a                                  good idea that should benefit everyone                                  like you know we have democracy you also                                  need to have democracy we will send our                                  troops to help you get democracy or                                  something like that                                  we have this religion and it's going to                                  benefit everyone sometimes I wonder if                                  maybe OpenStreetMap is not the right                                  thing for everyone maybe this idea we                                  have OpenStreetMap it is so great and                                  it's had have already helped all these                                  people it's also going to help you let's                                  put this marginalised group on the map                                  because we are sure that it will benefit                                  maybe sometimes I sometimes feel there                                  might be a hint of cultural imperialism                                  like you know this is we know this is                                  good and it's going to be good for you                                  maybe you don't know it yourself but we                                  are going to help you                                  I wonder if and and you and you set                                  things like let us put marginalize                                  people on on the boards and let us try                                  and shape the organization to fit these                                  people better but just because there are                                  different kinds of marginalized people                                  don't doesn't mean they agree on the                                  contrary marginalized people fight each                                  other to the death in very many areas of                                  the planet so maybe maybe it is a bad                                  idea to have one organization one                                  central organization to run all this one                                  OpenStreetMap project maybe there should                                  be like smaller federated projects and                                  then people could like design locally                                  how they want their whatever mapping or                                  maybe they don't want any I don't know                                  maybe we should go away from this from                                  this idea of having the the hot or the                                  open street ever or something just say                                  you know let's let's try and kind of                                  federalize that in some way in a                                  personal note I kind of find it very                                  comfortable uncomfortable when someone                                  says hey you are the map maker David I                                  am just a map maker I'm not the map                                  maker I think there's some connection to                                  that kind of let's be the hero let's                                  let's this is good for you and I am                                  trying to unlearn under that that image                                  of the geographer by Johannes Vermeer on                                  the left                                  I think that's related to that I agree                                  with their point                                  what if there's going to be a ministry                                  of mapping led by indigenous peoples and                                  it's not OpenStreetMap OS I'm a bird who                                  covers it that's what I said earlier                                  maybe it's not it shouldn't be me who                                  should be making these these maps I                                  totally agree with that on a particular                                  point a moment when I went to the altar                                  I went to a conference a Maori housing                                  an urban                                  conference funded by my scholarship I                                  was so excited I thought the more                                  intellectual and activist let's let's do                                  OpenStreetMap in outer oh it's gonna be                                  good for everyone and dr.
