sings I'm just gonna                                tell you my audio cables plump in and                                we'll see what happens at the end say                                can anyone tell me where states of the                                map was in                                                             good                                Pete hand up if you were there it was my                                first state of the map we've got one                                side one two three four five six of us                                that's cool you can maybe spot them                                there there's a few people drinking                                enough they - it was much smaller and                                more casual and so I want to invite                                Dermot to come up because Dermot you                                were there in sorry I should get back                                do you know where you are you in the                                photo yeah we kind of hidden behind my                                separate yeah oh that's nice                                so yes demet was there and don't shake                                my Poland it's a OpenStreetMap community                                like covers and you sent me some photos                                that you do different things organize                                events and projects which maybe you're                                part of a t-shirt which that's some                                state of the map he you it's in                                yes sorry I should have I didn't expect                                them to speak but he's also you would                                poet laureate of state the best my                                understanding I'm still poet laureate                                because there hasn't been another poetry                                competition since Amsterdam                                so yeah I'm constraint that communities                                I mean I think if you are in a                                constraint knuckle what you all are by                                being here then having you have a                                community it may be small it may be                                large it makes some of these things that                                I think my volunteer be organized                                different things and it's great that we                                have this formality there's the                                OpenStreetMap                                foundation which represents                                OpenStreetMap and runs the official                                website and some of the official servers                                and runs this conference and we have a                                local chapter kind of framework to say                                ah there's an organization in this area                                at the world they are representing                                OpenStreetMap in that area might mean                                myself I'm part of OpenStreetMap UK                                which is kind of your neighbor and so                                I'm quite excited we we do overlap with                                our remit because of political                                situations but we won't go into but and                                because of different organizations that                                overlap anyway we overlap in in our in                                overlaps with yours which is very                                exciting but you know we want you to be                                an official I presume that foundation                                local chapter you've been working on                                that creating a formal organization                                that's registered in Ireland and so if I                                can write down some of the agency                                Foundation board members and there yes                                it's gonna come just the water than my                                getting yeah and I'm game Paul cool

        what being a local chapter means and I                                 think the very thing to talk to you even                                 if it's at early stages and to answer                                 your questions you can be member of our                                 like the chapter you can also be a                                 member of the Foundation which is great                                 if there isn't a formal local chapter in                                 your area I encourage you to go to the                                 website how did that happen I encourage                                 you to go to that website you're new                                 become a foundation I really hope it                                 doesn't do that on the other slide so                                 let's move on to this then and I want to                                 say well done to everyone that was

I                                 want to share with friends so thank you                                 for them they've been really helpful                                 with their equipment and when things                                 when some of us less able that                                 technology you needed help and there's                                 some special thanks that they think on a                                 team but we got Dorothea                                 he's the administer for the foundation                                 we like to use her time a lot                                 in group so she's particularly helped                                 with the scholarships and their visas so                                 people could come Frederic Ram he's the                                 treasurer on the board is really helpful                                 just about kind of finance because                                 obviously there's a lot of money coming                                 and going and it probably causes some                                 headache                                 Ilia who we wanted to have Awards a few                                 years ago and it never happened and                                 because we're too busy running the                                 conference so Ilya thank you for I love                                 that they now happen every year and                                 that's why I included the names in                                 earlier on Rachel who helped with the                                 hot summit and was working on that                                 because if some of you might have gone                                 to that in the dates before this one so                                 it was really great to have a connection                                 on both teams doing that and things like                                 just moving so you had Express                                 registration and you know we knew things                                 would be clear and we didn't duplicate                                 effort we could reuse things like the                                 names ideas and Tom Hughes who helps                                 with the operations working group and                                 kind of things like the website and                                 systems and all these people in their                                 own thing even these people stood up                                 here they helped with little bit because                                 there's lots of things that if we had to                                 do them all sometimes we just need to                                 find someone can you sort this out and                                 come back to me with the details or oh I                                 think we've both got this covered one                                 person could do it can you get to the                                 other room where they're short on people                                 they've been really great we've had some                                 of you guys are on the Erasmus mapping                                 program it's been great to see you and                                 have your help as well so so that's all                                 the things but as I said there are names                                 in the booklet please thank them                                 individually if you see them and for all                                 those people and groups I mentioned                                 another round of applause please                                 [Applause]                                 [Music]                                 yeah                                 so it just very

exist I hope you had a great time                                 make new friends learn something new and                                 yeah just had a good time so as he                                 already said it's of course a lot of                                 work to organize such a conference and I                                 would say that without support from the                                 organization committee the local team                                 couldn't have made it and just a small                                 gift from us to                                 [Music]                                 [Applause]                                 [Music]                                 thank you guys I'll let you go back to                                 your seats something you don't like even                                 being at the run you have thank you more                                 thank yous so these people are great I                                 don't have to spank the sponsors you                                 know they didn't pay for me to include                                 them in the closing but they do enable                                 us to keep ticket prices low                                 we need these volunteers but you know                                 there's things like catering and the                                 venue higher and also we have a                                 scholarship program for people that need                                 a city financial assistance with whether                                 that be flights or flights and                                 accommodation and without the sponsors                                 we wouldn't yeah we wouldn't be able to                                 do that it just would be a bit beyond us                                 or you your ticket price will probably                                 be far too expensive for me to ever have                                 started coming say thank you to them                                 that's the the main sponsors up there                                 and some of the other ones                                 [Applause]                                 [Music]                                 and that was a blank slide which                                 confused me but what does it take so                                 this is the design of the logo in his                                 iteration hopefully you now know it's                                 you've maybe gone to the bridge where                                 there's the brass monkey which the logos                                 based on if not you can check that out                                 later and there's some dates here I took                                 on a you know it starts in March you                                 might think when when the call for                                 venues comes out we have a public call                                 asking who wants to host which community                                 once stakes of the map to come to them I                                 would say it actually starts before                                 March because we need as you saw how                                 many volunteers there were and that                                 really was involved with all the tiers                                 and you can look at all the names and                                 they really helped too and so we need                                 people locally we need people with                                 experience of running an event so I                                 would say if you want state of the map                                 to come and to come to your local                                 matters which I think you should that                                 actually run a smaller event running a                                 city state of the map run a country one                                 or a regional we hear about these murthy                                 we hear you know there's oh there's lots                                 of events going on like state of the                                 matthew state of the map Asia they're                                 not the international one they're not                                 run by the foundation as such but you                                 can get in touch with us the state of                                 the map team are details on the                                 foundation website or on the conference                                 website and you can so you can get in                                 touch with us and we'll help you and                                 we've got some notes that we built up                                 over the years on how to run a good                                 event and I would say that's a great way                                 to start and then you can think about                                 hmm                                                                                                                                                                   but if you think that then that means                                 you've got time to run an event we can                                 see that you've got experience as a                                 local team we can see you've got                                 experience running an event and to know                                 how that went                                 and then we can help talk to you about                                 how you could scale that so really it's                                 much better if before March next year                                 you get in touch with us before that but                                 I kind of missed the year there didn't I                                 I kind of missed                                                         say yes so we we did the call for venues                                                                                                          responses straightaway because yeah this                                 is why it's good to plan early and start                                 thinking about it even two years before                                 if you want to do that but we did decide                                 where we had some contact with people                                 after the deadline closed and and then                                 we had the decision to make still and                                 you can see I'm really building up to                                 this and I get really excited because I                                 have to figure out where I'm putting my                                 main holiday each year and say if we                                 have a drumroll please in                                               the map will be in                                 Cape Town                                 [Applause]                                 so they were the days if you need to                                 tell your boss that you need the time                                 off holiday or you need to tell you boss                                 that he's going to pay for you to go to                                 the conference and start you know                                 sweet-talking him now maybe gonna buy a                                 state of the map beer from outside and                                 take that back to him but if you've got                                 a if you if you've if you're here you're                                 a delegate you're on the mailing list so                                 once we sorting out more details which                                 tends to come around Christmas New Year                                 time when we've built up and put more                                 things in place then we'll send an email                                 to the delegates of this year if you                                 didn't come here so you're watching the                                 live stream or one of these people is                                 gonna go back and tell their friends                                 that you should come to state of the map                                                                                                       the mat website that's on the bottom                                 there and there's an email signup for                                 update so we will reuse that for for                                 next year so so not now and so we're                                 defense you know maybe South Africa's                                 far away for it for you maybe July is                                 far away for you there are lots of                                 OpenStreetMap events and you really                                 can't read this because there's so many                                 which is why I put the address up there                                 current offense so looking at the flags                                 we've got things happening all over                                 Germany Japan France UK I won't try and                                 identify every flag but yeah there's                                 stuff happening in your area if not see                                 what sort of events happen and organize                                 one and keep mapping and encouraging                                 each other in what OpenStreetMap work                                 you do meanwhile say if you've got a                                 name badge we actually the holders for                                 these were used for conference and then                                 they got returned and were reused for                                 the hot summit and they                                 returned and we reuse them for this                                 conference because you know we care                                 about the environment and we're                                 recycling and so will your name badge                                 there's a big blue box by the Welcome                                 Desk if you could take it before you                                 leave dropped it in there and that will                                 be really helpful because it can be                                 passed on to another conference and we                                 can reduce plastic waste and things like                                 that if you what help with your travel                                 information gain somewhere up at the                                 Welcome Desk they have a screen with the                                 upcoming train times I think and they've                                 got printouts of the schedules                                 they've also there's some local                                 expertise there don't ask me how to use                                 the travel system in Heidelberg or or                                 you know what's good they'll be much                                 better and also you could maybe ask them                                 if you're staying around where should I                                 go what should I do and now have                                 recommendations so we're ending this                                 conference at the end of this next piece                                 the conference will end when it reaches                                 zero on the counter so the team would                                 like to start packing down particular in                                 this room and the other rooms say yes so                                 please you can go up to the foyer and
