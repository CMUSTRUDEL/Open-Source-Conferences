Title: 2019: Access to Prosperity: Quantifying Infrastructure Impact With OSM
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 3, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	In many regions of the world, a population’s access to essential services is unduly constrained by a lack of proper infrastructure. By performing accessibility analysis using OSM data, we can understand how route infrastructure impacts access to essential services and use that information to inform an intervention.

This talk explores accessibility analysis performed to understand the impact of footbridge construction in eSwatini and introduces a python framework enabling users to perform similar analysis.

Bridges over rivers are fundamental pieces of human infrastructure which enable safe crossings for the populations who use them. However, many rural regions of the world lack these critical bridges, and as a result, access to essential services is restricted for millions of people.

In pursuit of tackling poverty caused by rural isolation, we have begun experimenting using remote analysis techniques to quantify bridge need and impact. To these ends, accessibility analyses using OSM and other data have proven to be extremely valuable.

By comparing a population’s baseline accessibility to its access in scenarios such as a flood or post bridge construction, one can better understand the transportation dynamics of a region and even estimate the number of people that would be impacted with a bridge construction, for example.

During the course of running various accessibility models, a python framework tebetebe was built around OSRM [Open Source Routing Machine] which simplifies the process of running different scenarios. This framework is built with footbridges in mind but is generalized so it may be applied to other applications.

This talk explores the accessibility analysis process, its caveats and results achieved in the Kingdom of eSwatini. Finally, a walkthrough of the python framework tebetebe is given so that other users may perform similar analyses.

Owen but                               access to prosperity quantify and                               infrastructure impact with OpenStreetMap                               and he's gonna talk a little bit yeah I                               learned before it is traveling a lot so                               I'm very looking forward in doing the                               amazing things developing software for                                different kind of yeah to address                                different kind of challenges not                                specifically looking at the impact of                                the lack of infrastructures and how we                                can actually the impact of actually                                overcoming these challenges as well yeah                                let's give the floor to you great thank                                you for the introduction Melanie so yeah                                my name is Davey lovin and today I'm                                going to talk about quantifying                                infrastructure impact with OpenStreetMap                                and so my agenda today I'm gonna talk                                about some community development                                projects that I've been working on in sy                                teeny and I'm also gonna talk about how                                we're using data analysis and                                OpenStreetMap to help maximize our                                impact in those projects and I'm also                                that will lead to talking about this                                Python package that I've written in                                order to help quantify infrastructure                                impact and how you can also use that                                yourself so first of all where is a SWAT                                teeny and I'm just curious how many                                people here know where s Latini or                                Swaziland is alright yeah a good show                                everybody                                and then I guess for those who don't                                know it's down here in southern Africa                                it's this cute little country nestled in                                between South Africa and Mozambique and                                Swaziland also a SWAT teeny it's it's                                quite a small country in fact it's about                                double the circumference of the London                                metro area so not a huge country but for                                what it lacks in size it makes up for in                                hills so this is just a map of the                                terrain ruggedness and you can see the                                left part of the country or the West is                                super hilly and it's just when you go on                                the ground in Swaziland this is what you                                see                                it's just hills and you've got a lot of                                cattle and all of these little                                homesteads kind of dotted on the                                hillside so also in addition to a lot of                                hills                                Swaziland has got a lot of rivers and                                I'm gonna focus on this little portion                                right here in Swaziland in fact this is                                the backyard of the house that I was                                staying at for the last couple months I                                took this picture about two months ago                                or started two weeks ago and this is the                                winter and you can see over to the left                                here you've got this little river going                                by and it's the dry season so the rivers                                not so high but I just want you guys to                                focus on that little slide in the                                background there this is what it looks                                like in the rainy season so the rivers                                swell like crazy and it becomes quite an                                issue in fact I love trail running right                                across the river but in the summer I                                just can't get there because the rivers                                are so wide it just rains all the time                                and so that's a little bit of an issue                                for me but for a lot of people in                                Swaziland it's actually a big issue for                                them to get to their nearest services                                and particularly this is a news article                                about River flooding and people not                                being able to get to school for about                                two weeks so it's a little issue for me                                but for a lot of other people it's a big                                one and this is exacerbated by the lack                                of proper infrastructure in order to get                                over these rivers and this is just a                                picture of what some river crossings                                really do look like typically just                                really makeshift crossings that are                                really inadequate for providing traffic                                year-round so with that in mind for you                                friends of mine about three years ago we                                heard of this need and we decided that                                we wanted to do something about it this                                is a group of us we were University                                students of the University of Colorado                                and we kind of sent it to Swaziland to                                see if we can help address these                                 challenges we went to the communities                                 and we visited we heard about their need                                 we did technical surveys with our survey                                 equipment and then we had the great                                 fortune of meeting this organization                                 called Swaziland microprojects which is                                 a governmental organization that we                                 partnered with with funding and other                                 resources in order to implement some                                 foot bridges for the country super dope                                 so we ended up breaking ground about a                                 year later on our first foot bridge in                                 Swaziland                                 and that was really just overall amazing                                 amazing time missing program and you                                 know actually I'm just gonna this is I                                 want you guys to also get an idea of                                 what it is like to to be in these                                 community projects because we're not a                                 major developmental organization we are                                 straight-up mixing concrete by hand with                                 community members and we are building                                 these foot bridges with the people on                                 the ground so we're not huge                                 organization we are just about the                                 people and so in the end we got                                 ourselves a footbridge and it was a                                 humongous success and then we built                                 another and another and overall so far                                 we have six foot bridges that we've                                 built in the country so far and as far                                 as the theme of this conference being                                 bridging the map we've officially added                                 six foot bridges to the map so far and                                 Counting so now what though so we've                                 started these programs and we want to                                 build all these foot bridges to provide                                 access to the entire country but the way                                 that we were going wasn't in a                                 sustainable kind of scaleable way so we                                 decided to kind of scale up our efforts                                 and change their our approach in order                                 to really solve this problem for the                                 whole entire country so to do that we                                 want to develop a partnership structure                                 and perform our national needs                                 assessment I'm gonna focus on this                                 national needs assessment because it's                                 really relevant to OpenStreetMap so when                                 you perform a national needs assessment                                 you got to figure out where is there a                                 need for foot bridges in the entire                                 country so the way that we used to do it                                 would be we were just here a foot bridge                                 need kind of through the grapevine and                                 then we would visit and we'd meet with                                 these people go to the bridge site and                                 see if there was a need go for all the                                 technical analysis but you know it works                                 and it's great but it's really time                                 consuming you end up spending all day                                 and as much as I love hanging out in the                                 rural areas and you know going to                                 people's homesteads you know we really                                 we want to figure out this problem on                                 the whole entire country so we're gonna                                 need a new approach so that new approach                                 is all powered                                 OpenStreetMap so what we do is we visit                                 these tink homeland meetings and here we                                 have the                                                               every Tuesday they've gathered together                                 for development we go there we present                                 our projects and we record the lawn last                                 of the potential bridges that these                                 local leaders have identified so this is                                 literally I mean this is just what it                                 looks like we sit down with these local                                 leaders and they show us where they need                                 infrastructure they also show us where                                 they would be going crossing at that                                 infrastructure and then they also tell                                 us things like flood prone bridges which                                 will be crucial to our flood models that                                 we do later on                                 and we take all this stuff and we put it                                 into OpenStreetMap we're also training                                 some local guys like this is my man                                 Steven Issa right here to do this and in                                 fact they are doing it as we speak for                                 the entire country and the second part                                 is these traveling salesman site visits                                 and it's not like we've figured out the                                 routes with the Traveling Salesman                                 algorithm we're really just traveling                                 around kind of selling these foot                                 bridges to the local leaders and we've                                 been able to get our efficiency up to                                 about four sites that we can visit per                                 day whereas it was one before just by                                 scheduling all these sites in a row and                                 we navigate to these sites with osm                                 Android and we're using ODK for the                                 on-the-ground assessments so yeah we                                 record all sorts information at each                                 site including its technical and social                                 survey and we collect a lot of site                                 media for every place that these is it                                 and yeah this is just what it looks like                                 it's a beautiful country                                 so the third part about it is the                                 footbridge impact analysis which is what                                 I'm gonna focus on here today                                 so after going all these bridge sites we                                 have a ton of these potential sites and                                 we have a bunch of technical and social                                 data and what we really want is a                                 prioritized list of sites we don't know                                 what will happen in the future we want                                 to really prioritize the ones that are                                 most important and so that we can                                 address those first but then collected                                 impact data was unreliable if you ask                                 people how many people are impacted by                                 the footbridge they're gonna be you know                                 saying a lot of people because they know                                 that the more in                                 the more likelihood that we will build                                 the bridge there so we want to                                 deterministic approach to figure out the                                 impact of these foot bridges so I'm                                 gonna show you guys what we're doing and                                 I'm gonna do a little example here this                                 little region of the country down yonder                                 so here we have a satellite view of a                                 community at Fletch any in Swaziland                                 and you can see here we've got this big                                 river coming through that and when PC                                 River and we've got all of these cute                                 little homesteads dotted on the hillside                                 that's an orange and then we've also got                                 a route network so these are all the                                 little roads and the dotted lines are                                 all the pathways and of particular                                 importance for these models are the                                 Fords and so for those of you who don't                                 know the Fords are where highways meet                                 waterways and there's no infrastructure                                 like a bridge say and so we were brought                                 to this particular Ford by a community                                 leader who said they really have an                                 issue going to sell well a primary                                 school across the river amongst other                                 places and that they wanted a footbridge                                 here so that they could increase access                                 to this primary school so in order to                                 run to understand the impact that we                                 would have by building this footbridge                                 here we're going to do a routing                                 scenario comparison we're going to                                 compare a normal access model with a                                 flood access model to answer the                                 question what impact is a flood have on                                 this region and then we're going to                                 compare a flood model with a bridge                                 model which would say what impact does a                                 bridge have in event of a flood so here                                 we're gonna run normal vs. flood                                 scenario so this is a normal scenario                                 where these Fords are crossable and say                                 the water is low you can hop from rock                                 to rock and it's not a huge issue though                                 it isn't inconvenience we're going to                                 compare that to a flood scenario where                                 those those Fords are blocked and people                                 can no longer cross there so the houses                                 in green are                                 ones that the model has said they are                                 have a different that it's different                                 between on normal and flood scenario so                                 these are homesteads that are impacted                                 by a flood and you can see that by                                 looking at the routes so these green                                 routes when routed or green homesteads                                 when routed to the primary school you                                 know they can go just straight across                                 these Fords without an issue and that's                                 the way that they would go to the school                                 the fastest route but then when you look                                 at the flood-affected routes I mean                                 they've got to go all the way up to the                                 top of the screen over to the main road                                 and down and though I don't have a scale                                 here that's about seven eight kilometers                                 and so often these children just don't                                 go to school because it's such a long                                 walk and so next we're gonna do a                                 scenario flood versus bridge so here                                 again we have the flood scenario where                                 all those boards are blocked but then                                 we're gonna upgrade that one Ford to a                                 bridge and see what happens so the                                 purple homesteads are the ones that it's                                 shows are affected by a bridge and these                                 are the routes that they would take in                                 flood similar to what they were just                                 before and then when you put a bridge in                                 as you can see they all can go across                                 the bridge and that is their shortest                                 route to get to that primary school so                                 on top of being able to visualize the                                 difference in between flood and                                 in-between bridges it's really nice um                                 oh actually before I say that I just                                 want to show that there's a difference                                 between the flood verse bridge scenario                                 and the bridge verse Ludd scenario so                                 the green homesteads are impacted by a                                 flood but they're not impacted by the                                 bridge and you can see these guys on the                                 right here                                 they aren't impacted by the bridge                                 because they would have to cross that                                 first ford before they'd get to the                                 bridge so it's just it's an interesting                                 way to visualize the dynamics of flood                                 and access in a particular place so on                                 top of the visualization we get this                                 data that we can use to answer questions                                 like how much time and distance is saved                                 for each homestead on average so we have                                 the flood or the normal distance the                                 normal                                 the flood and the bridge and we can                                 compare that to answer the question                                 what's the average time saved                                 how many homesteads are impacted and                                 start to answer more complicated                                 questions just load that thing into our                                 and have a field day with all that data                                 so when I was running this analysis when                                 I was running this scenario stuff I                                 thought to myself this is I'm not the                                 only person out there that wants to run                                 routing scenarios and so I decided like                                 I'm gonna build a Python package for the                                 good of the open-source community                                 because I love you guys so that if                                 anyone wants to do similar routing                                 analysis it will be SuperDuper easy so I                                 created an epoch today which is a debit                                 debit which is means footbridge in to                                 spot C and it's a wrapper a Python API                                 around the open source routing machine                                 so you guys can run routing analysis                                 super easy and I'm gonna show you guys                                 real quick how it works so here we have                                 a scenario schematic and all of these                                 bubbles here are classes within the                                 Python API so you've got a routing                                 profile that can be either car bicycle                                 or in my case that I just used it would                                 be a flood profile and then you've got                                 an OS M data set that could be an geo                                 fabric extract that can be overpass                                 query and then you pipe those into a                                 scenario that will show you you know a                                 routing scenario for a particular data                                 set then in Python you call this                                 scenario which compiles it and then it                                 provides a context manager to serve the                                 HTTP API so that you can query the                                 scenario and get routes and tables all                                 the things that you would want when                                 you're doing routing and then in that                                 scenario API you can you know run                                 origins and destinations with pio I                                 datasets and the way that I've written                                 it as well you can you can create a Pio                                 idea set from anything from an OG R so I                                 like a shape file or an overpass query                                 and you can pipe in an OS M data set                                 from a PDF file or overpass and so what                                 this allows you to do is really you can                                 very much just with various overpass                                 queries pull the route network and then                                 pull the PIO is and then run this                                 routing on the fly so in particular                                 before like I said the foot profile                                 and the normal scenario this is what it                                 looked like I just put profile with the                                 Swaziland PBF I piped that into the                                 Swazi foot scenario called it it's an                                 API and then the origins of the                                 homesteads and the destinations were the                                 schools the flood scenario is a similar                                 sort of thing the only thing that's                                 different is the flood profile and I                                 want to zoom up real quick on this flood                                 profile because I think it's really neat                                 to see what the difference was I just                                 took the normal profile for walking and                                 I added a way handler and a node handle                                 are super simple super readable you can                                 just see here if bridge is yes flood                                 prone equals yes return false right like                                 don't route here if the block if Ford                                 equals yes it's a barrier super simple                                 super readable I really like OS R M                                 because of this and I think it's a                                 really readable reproducible routing                                 analysis so I would love if you guys                                 want to use it and here's a little                                 script just to see what's going on it's                                 super simple you initialize the scenario                                 with the PDF file and like a default                                 foot profile and then with scenario and                                 then the parenthesis you call it it                                 returns itself provides a context                                 manager so that you can query it with                                 the routing I you know I'm not doing                                 something super novel here I'm just                                 making it really easy for people to run                                 routing scenarios because it was a bit                                 complex when I was looking to do it                                 first myself and that's what it will                                 tell you this particular example it                                 gives you just a quick little duration                                 and distance so the features right now                                 it's got a the core of it is this OS RM                                 scenario API that you can call and it's                                 super easy to you know start up a                                 routing engine it's also got                                 accessibility isochrones it does route                                 comparison which will allow you to do                                 just what I did before in fact all the                                 example of the code and the results that                                 I have are now                                 and on the examples so you can check                                 that out and it provides a bit of an                                 analysis pipeline which just makes it                                 easy just to grab the data pull it all                                 in do the analysis and spit out                                 something useful I would like to                                 implement shared memory which would be                                 neat which is where you can you know                                 update the node and edge weights in real                                 time and so you don't have to recompile                                 the scenarios I'd like to do awesome Ian                                 filters which could allow programmable                                 updates of the network we really need                                 parallelization and all this other wish                                 list sort of stuff and I'm continuing to                                 development on this even though it's                                 been I mean it serves the purposes for                                 me but I'm just gonna do it because I                                 have a feeling somebody might want it                                 out there the caveats of this all I just                                 want to mention the HTTP API which it                                 takes in order to query for a particular                                 route it introduces a lot of overhead if                                 you're gonna be running a bajillion                                 requests you're gonna be having a lot of                                 a bottleneck with all these HTTP                                 requests there's a bunch of i/o between                                 the OSM data and then writing the                                 scenarios and also the default routing                                 profiles you really gotta be careful I                                 mean look over here you see these guys                                 that are crossing the river and then                                 crossing it back to get to the school I                                 mean that's not realistic I should                                 definitely go in there and then have a                                 time delay for førde equals yes I just                                 want you all to be careful and not just                                 run it with the default profile and                                 you're like oh wow I got some results                                 you know you really got to look into it                                 so check out the docs I wrote a bunch of                                 documentation a bunch of script examples                                 so that you know some of you might find                                 it useful and then be able to use it and                                 I would love if you did if you do you                                 should just holler at me because it                                 would totally make my day so yeah great                                 I made it to the end of the talk thank                                 goodness                                 and yeah real quick acknowledgments I                                 want to acknowledge you all people                                 everything that I written was completely                                 open-source and you know written by the                                 open-source community I'm just building                                 I'm on the shoulders of giants which is                                 all you guys so thank you so much                                 everybody I also want to thank all these                                 children that mapped a bunch of houses                                 in Swaziland that have been using in my                                 model and thanks to all the Italian                                 people that made that happen                                 OSR em you guys are the homies you made                                 a really great routing engine                                 OpenStreetMap foundation is sponsoring                                 me to be here at Mapple stated because                                 they've inspired me so much with doing                                 mapping yeah and also all my homies in                                 Swaziland because this is like seriously                                 the best thing that ever happened to me                                 on this yeah the projects that we're

             david brothers are there any questions                                 for Davey I think it's good for every                                 year yeah                                 hi thanks that was super interesting my                                 question is did you receive any pushback                                 that you didn't expect when doing this                                 project                                 hmmm                                 yes well they're very much pretty much                                 everyone told us that we couldn't do it                                 at the beginning when we were trying to                                 set up this program I mean we were                                 really university students just figuring                                 it out one step at a time so we got                                 plenty of people who told us we couldn't                                 do it at the beginning but then once the                                 ball started rolling it was a bit of                                 kind of just a project unto its own and                                 now we're at the point where we're                                 really well established when the                                 government really highly regarded in the                                 programs in a building and expanding                                 we're hiring a bunch of Swasey and                                 essentially they're running it on their                                 own I've essentially taught them all a                                 bunch of Swasey how to do all of the                                 work that I was doing so it's now you                                 know it's just the kind of the next                                 level so I would say we had pushback                                 initially but once you once you bring                                 people to one of these bridges yeah it's                                 like you know it's a whole different                                 level                                 not any more questions from the audits                                 yep                                 hi there thanks for a very exciting                                 presentation cool project I have a                                 technical question perhaps I missed it                                 but have I understood that your your                                 metric of distance or time that they are                                 essentially interchangeable that they                                 are just a constant factor different or                                 is there something that you do about                                 terrain computation so that you account                                 also for hill slopes of the trails that                                 people need to walk yeah that's a great                                 question so the default routing profile                                 is what I use for the time metric and                                 the distance is just what it returns you                                 know when you're when you look at the                                 route and you just calculate the                                 distance you know on the ground but in                                 particular you're correct that for a                                 walking profile it's really critical to                                 have elevation data in there and as you                                 could see even on the example it shows                                 various routes that are going down the                                 hill and then back up and you got a                                 figure that that's not realistic so it                                 does not incorporate that elevation                                 profile but the thing about it was I                                 mean at the beginning of project I was                                 like yeah right my own routing engine                                 sounds dope I was like man I got way too                                 deep into it right but that's why I                                 built it around OS RM because OS RM does                                 have that functionality to incorporate                                 raster elevation data in the calculation                                 that it makes for distance and time and                                 so I don't say I would use those                                 interchangeably they're just useful to                                 understand when looking you know I                                 wouldn't use them both together but I                                 would use them separately say you're                                 saving a certain amount of distance or a                                 certain amount of time when we're                                 talking to different stakeholders                                 yeah amazing work I may have a coach for                                 you after Delta here's my question                                 the it's some amazing stuff here and you                                 thank the community that you worked with                                 and I'd have been Canada and for me to                                 get high school students to do something                                 in their own backyard similar to this is                                 like pulling teeth have you thought                                 about your experience working in these                                 so-called developing countries that we                                 could benefit from say back in Denver                                 where they're looking at climate                                 resilience in others similar issues that                                 they're dealing with just super good                                 question so I will say when you're                                 coalescing a community underneath a                                 tangible infrastructure is really                                 powerful because it's less of a vaporous                                 idea for instance you know as opposed to                                 climate change right and so I think a                                 lot of the strength in our projects I                                 mean we have people volunteering their                                 labor entirely you know all day long for                                 various weeks and I think unfortunately                                 it's like the motivation is so much                                 stronger in these communities somehow                                 then I see in actually I did live in                                 Denver as well at some point you know                                 between people also you got to figure                                 that the life in these homesteads I mean                                 people are just chilling I mean they                                 don't they're don't have                                              not stressed right so it's really easier                                 to motivate and organize and you know a                                 project like this when people are you                                 know also very starved for development                                 right because this I mean these are some                                 of the nicest pieces of infrastructure                                 around so unfortunately I don't have off                                 the top of my head and on the spot a way                                 that you could you know coalesce or                                 start something like this and say Denver                                 but I think it all comes down to really                                 like making the people like believe like                                 something that they can tangibly do and                                 then it's not such a just a vaporous                                 idea of telling them and we actually do                                 when we start these projects we actually                                 bring the community leaders we ask them                                 to form a bridge committee and we                                 one of the other foot bridges and when                                 they go back to their community I mean                                 they just you know it's it's just                                 obvious to these people like once you                                 can really show them the tangible                                 results of them working together hi                                 thanks and I'm wondering how do the                                 results from your quantitative analysis                                 filter into the prior ization process of                                 deciding where to build the next                                 footbridge and in relation to that how                                 do you deal with like completeness of                                 data like how do you assess in which                                 community you like which percent of                                 houses are actually mapped because this                                 obviously has a big influence on your                                 results great questions so to the last                                 one so actually I I'm sure you guys                                 realize I talked really fast I wasn't                                 about to like shove some more stuff in                                 that presentation but actually in                                 between when we first visit the in Kulas                                 and then when we actually do the site                                 visits we run like a mapathon by the way                                 that mapathon is usually just me right                                 but also really great is that these                                 children have made a huge amount of                                 buildings that are available in s                                 martini                                 so these children at also actually                                 typically it's just me adding the route                                 networks and the Fords I'm in order to                                 do these studies which is really                                 manageable at scale as opposed to                                 tracing all these buildings and actually                                 what was the first question got it so                                 also you know the benefit of our                                 projects being like community-based                                 initiatives you know we don't have like                                 these crazy you know                                 you know four or five letter                                 organizations that are you know really                                 you know like we need proof or whatnot                                 really the biggest thing is that you                                 know and like I you can do the data                                 analysis like I showed but really it's                                 the visualizations to talk to these                                 government people because you know                                 people in Swasey really you're just like                                 look at this                                 and they're like okay yeah we get it                                 right and so really more or less for                                 proving it to ourselves we're not really                                 proving it to others because in the end                                 we are the ones that are the driving                                 forces behind these projects so it's                                 really it comes out of our own internal                                 desire to make these the most impactful                                 it's not about proof for somebody else                                 in order to kind of fund our projects or                                 something like that                                 that's a great question maybe if time                                 for quick one just before we go to the                                 lunch break yeah                                 a great hope thanks very much it's super                                 important obviously to get kids to kids                                 to school but were there other metrics                                 as well such as farmers getting their                                 crops to market and that sort of thing                                 that were important to the analysis yeah                                 absolutely and if I understood the                                 question correctly it was just that you                                 know in this particular example I'll use                                 just just one school but there's other                                 locations that people go to absolutely                                 so you know for this visualization that                                 I put on here I wanted to make it really                                 simple or else there would be just                                 routes everywhere but also like I say                                 when we do the community when we go to                                 these in Kuma's and we find all the POS                                 it's actually more than just one                                 destination that we're recording                                 typically it's schools in clinics and                                 nearest towns slash public transport                                 that's like the top ones sometimes you                                 know like spiritual healers and football                                 fields and things like that but we do                                 record all these things together and                                 they are a part of the analysis and                                 visualizations that we make I just                                 simplified it for this particular                                 example in the route comparison scenario                                 or sorry the route comparison class that                                 I built you know it takes multiple                                 destinations into account ok great thank                                 you very much baby I think gray we have                                 to wrap it up stage
