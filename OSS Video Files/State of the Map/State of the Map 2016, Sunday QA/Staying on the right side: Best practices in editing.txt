Title: Staying on the right side: Best practices in editing
Publication date: 2017-02-14
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Sunday QA
Description: 
	Ethan Nelson, Mikel Maron, and Paul Norman at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/staying-on-the-right-side-best-practices-in-editing/

This session will examine best practices in editing conflicts, mechanical editing and editing tools. It comprises three parts.

First, Ethan Nelson will show a few examples of editing disputes he has seen during his time on the Data Working group. Country extents and borders are a highly contentious issue and conflicts inevitably arise in the depiction of these. Ethan will submit practical proposals to better represent diverse global viewpoints of borders.

Frederik Ramm will then explain why so-called “mechanical edits” - edits in which a large number of objects are changed without looking at them individually - can be detrimental to OpenStreetMap. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrvcVAPdaWI

Finally, Simon Poole will review editing tools. He will give an overview of some “shoulds” and “don’ts” that both consumer and developers should consider when choosing a tool and developing one. The talk will be peppered with examples of some of the more arcane stuff you need to deal with to avoid criticism for using or writing a tool that breaks stuff. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wg0P32QhO4

I guess we'll go ahead and get started

00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:10,170
maybe we're a few minutes late and some

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:12,480
people come in later so this session is

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,509
titled staying on the right side of

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,130
mapping and my first talk is gonna be

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,740
talking about deterring and diffusing

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,500
disputes so my name is Ethan and I'm

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,230
part of the OSM foundations data working

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,390
group or I think better named is the

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,359
conflict working group as opposed to

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,170
data working group I don't know we'll

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,610
see if we can change that name

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:40,710
eventually so do disputes occur in osm

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:43,020
well the answer is absolutely maybe it's

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,680
a brief sample here I came up with some

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,840
some hypothetical ones so the first one

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,850
here's the one-way abandoned railroad we

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,949
surveyed and then the other person says

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,770
no actually that was a tree row the

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,539
railway was one block to the south so

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,270
that's pretty easy to solve right you

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,180
can go out you can survey it it's it's

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:07,020
yes or no there but you know things can

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,180
get maybe a little more hairy so how

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,420
about we should add the name alt name

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,619
the 6-2 Toronto and then the other

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,710
person says do they say that on the

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,720
ground and the person replies Drake does

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,960
so Drake is a rapper here and he calls

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,100
us hometown the six so I don't know do

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,939
they use it on the ground

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,970
should we add it it's a good question so

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,259
I do disputes occur well I mean we're a

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,840
huge community we've been learning all

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,340
about our smaller communities and coming

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,159
together as a global one but we're a

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,020
global project really and there's people

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,850
from all different countries different

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,040
communities all walks of life

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,619
they have different worldviews different

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,600
perspectives and life experiences and so

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,030
all of these you know when when we bring

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,070
them together it's to be expected that

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:58,320
there gonna be some conflicts or issues

00:01:53,070 --> 00:02:00,869
that might need to be resolved so I came

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,990
up with a little methodology that you

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,670
can use it won't apply to all situations

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,340
but maybe something to approach to

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,160
speech generally so the first thing is

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,130
really to engage the mappers in question

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,320
are the things that are going

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,940
through through discussions whether they

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,710
be public through things like changeset

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,320
comments here so I have whoops an

00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,500
example here where someone made a

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,860
comment on a change set you know hi is

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,240
this actually named future park road or

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,370
is it

00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,020
nakta Park Road that's gonna be there in

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,520
the future that sort of thing so just

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,420
kind of opening dialogue that that's

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,640
really an important part of the process

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,770
and if it's from an area that you're

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,230
really not from you're not familiar with

00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,450
also engaging other people from the

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,960
community who are from there is really

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,820
helpful and so when you use things like

00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,520
change set comments you provide the

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,770
avenue for those other people from the

00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,910
community to weigh in and provide either

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,950
their input or they review a bit another

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,630
thing to keep in mind is just looking at

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,270
the situation from the other mappers

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,100
point of view you know things might not

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:13,030
necessarily be interpreted the same way

00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:16,810
or you might you know an example would

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:19,600
be a tree row versus mapping a bunch of

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,790
trees individually so trying to keep an

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,400
open mind to why they're mapping and

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,450
what they're mapping and then obviously

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,060
when applicable

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,440
all of these passed points kind of

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,290
allude to this but try to follow an on

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,990
the ground solution so open stream map

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,940
is about concrete things things that are

00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,650
in the real world so so trying to follow

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,020
that and apply that principle is a

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,320
really good way to solving these

00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,630
problems or if that's maybe not as

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,840
straightforward looking for an amicable

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,850
solution and then finally if the problem

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,560
persists that's where the data working

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:57,760
group here comes in real handy and then

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,200
most of all through all your

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,780
interactions whether they they be

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,050
changed set comments or messages or

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,210
forum posts or whatever the key thing is

00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,760
to be civil and friendly because we are

00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,870
community we want to we want to welcome

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,720
every one of the community and when you

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,370
want make sure that things don't devolve

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,630
into some sort of at

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,000
or flame war so I thought this would be

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,979
a good opportunity to bring Mikkel up

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,229
for a few minutes to speak about the

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:28,060
situation and kind of the the events

00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:33,940
surrounding the actual formation of the

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:37,389
data working group it thinks things

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:40,449
Ethan for asking me to think tell what's

00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:42,610
the origin story of how we do dispute

00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:46,050
resolution in OpenStreetMap and of the

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:49,000
data working group some years ago

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:55,360
2007-2008 I believe on the talk mailing

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,760
list a mapper and it started asking for

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,370
help both on the mailing lists and

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,580
directly for an edit war in Northern

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:08,850
Cyprus the political situation in

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:11,260
Northern Cyprus in the 1970s Turkey

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,830
turkeys military moved into Northern

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:20,289
Cyprus and took over some portion of

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:22,030
that area it had been largely aligned

00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,580
with the Greek government and you know

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:29,050
historically Greek and and Turkey have

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:31,030
been have been at odds so today the

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:36,130
situation is that Northern Cyprus is

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:38,860
under more or less Turkish control this

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,530
is not internationally recognized by

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:45,550
anyone outside of Turkey maybe there's a

00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:48,580
few more and the situation in

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,460
OpenStreetMap that we found ourselves in

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,949
was towns in northern site and Northern

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,740
Cyprus are all named with Turkish names

00:05:53,949 --> 00:06:00,039
today if you go on the ground all of the

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,780
street signs will be in Turkish in the

00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:06,639
South for the rest of Cyprus it's in

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:09,150
Greek and a expat Brit living in

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,340
Northern Cyprus was mapping what he saw

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:16,270
the other editor was changing all those

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:19,300
names back to to Greek his father had

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:24,610
been from that area and he felt great

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:27,680
pride in the history of of that place

00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:33,710
and of those names and

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:35,150
was yes like him imposing is not the

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,000
right word but he was wanted

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,800
OpenStreetMap to reflect his his desires

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,300
for what Northern Cyprus should be and

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,460
actually what most of the world like

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,830
recognizes as the proper political

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:50,440
situation there so this was a very

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:54,380
tricky situation he asked for help and

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,240
Andy Robinson myself and and several

00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,699
others got very involved like well what

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,110
how do you resolve such a situation we

00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:03,289
didn't have a data working group we had

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:06,259
no guidelines we had no process so from

00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,789
the very start and I'm glad like this is

00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,800
still kind of the basis of how we do

00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:13,430
dispute resolution there was a lot of

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,320
like figuring out talking to everyone

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,320
involved trying to understand different

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,759
points of view suggesting solutions I

00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,440
think one of the first solutions that we

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,449
said well why not just use both names

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:29,240
and we're talking about the default name

00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:30,830
tag right so use both Greek and Turkish

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,800
and they were both actually amenable to

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:37,930
this but it came down to they could not

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,930
agree on which name would come first

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,820
we were very close but we had to

00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,190
actually in the end come up with some

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,770
rule and some decision and this is the

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,690
on the ground rule which is served

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,460
I think OpenStreetMap very well just the

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,880
idea you are if you are there in that

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,800
place and you are trying to use the map

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,599
what's going to be the most useful name

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,860
what's gonna be the most useful border

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,020
it may not be you know the most morally

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,090
and ethically right way may not be the

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,889
most like politically recognized way but

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:14,539
it's the practical thing that we're

00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:16,159
trying to trying to map and and that

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,930
also jives with how OpenStreetMap

00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:19,430
operates so that was the origin of the

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,270
on the ground rule we put together a

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:27,470
wiki page on disputes and and then it's

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:30,349
just kind of grown from there I hope

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,690
there's no longer any edit words wars in

00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:35,079
Cyprus but I can imagine it pops up from

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,079
time to time

00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:42,399
wonderful thank you for that so it kind

00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:45,250
of gives you an idea of the sorts of

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,879
things that that we as a day a working

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:52,000
group deal with just to reiterate that

00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,670
and add on a few things other sorts of

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,560
issues that we deal with are licensing

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,959
maybe someone's using copyrighted data

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,019
or something that doesn't mix with our

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,389
license doing any sort of like

00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:07,480
unauthorized imports or vandalism and

00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:09,430
then of course a serious disputes we

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,870
also do provide technical assistance I

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,290
mean I mean the data in the data working

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:17,290
group name we do provide technical

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,759
assistance at times in terms of change

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,769
sets that are very large or complex

00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,970
someone's made a bunch of edits and then

00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:25,149
people have come in and made

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,839
intermediate intermediary edits so

00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:32,079
trying to serve as a point of contact if

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,060
people do run into issues and then one

00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,790
of the powers that data working group

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,550
members do have are short-term blocks

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,230
which are really used to get the

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,329
attention of mappers so in the case

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,100
where you've been engaging with someone

00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:46,899
they're doing something that's obviously

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,279
wrong but they continue to do it they

00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:52,899
ignored any sort of comments or messages

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,870
that block can maybe provide them as a

00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:58,180
notice where they have to read it before

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,519
they can continue editing and that'll

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,490
kind of get their to get their attention

00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,740
or kind of nudge them and then also the

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,100
data working group can redact data as

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,100
necessary if it is improperly licensed

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:15,639
and then one thing we always look for so

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:18,040
in any sort of dispute we always want to

00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,529
see some sort of interaction first with

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,540
the other party so if someone is coming

00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,639
to us and saying that there's an issue

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,160
with another map or we generally like

00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,660
you to attempt at least solving that

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,910
whether the other person replies or not

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,470
that's a different story

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:36,459
but just looking for for some engagement

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:39,759
first and then another case in general I

00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:42,629
mean beyond naming different things is

00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,829
just border situations in general and

00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:47,199
this kind of goes into the I guess the

00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:49,060
second half of my talk abstract but

00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:50,920
looking toward

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,930
international borders I mean what I have

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,390
displayed here is the South China Sea

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,520
the Spratly Islands where it's obviously

00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:00,760
an area of strong contention between

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,370
many different countries I pulled this

00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,280
off a news website kind of just

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:08,070
displaying some of the different claims

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:11,530
with China with this 9 dashed line here

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,810
which was recently and validated by in

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,850
an International Court but then we have

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,310
all these other claims here that the

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:23,310
court didn't really even touch in terms

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,310
of saying what belongs to other people

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:30,130
the OpenStreetMap Foundation Board did

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,950
approve a resolution in 2013 here to

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,180
provide some guidance at least four

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:37,600
countries or other people interested

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:41,560
about how we deal with disputed

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,940
territories in these situations but as I

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,420
mentioned even about like this this

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,430
nine-dash line international systems

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,230
don't even necessarily define borders

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,790
either though if you look to the United

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,090
Nations or are all these different

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:58,690
bodies they might not have one set of

00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:00,250
borders or they might have a mixture or

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,870
what happens if you start producing new

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,150
land or if you're on a volcanic island

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:07,740
and it you know makes a lot more land

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,910
how are those situations dealt with and

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,400
in either case there's always going to

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,360
be some sort of conflict people are was

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,230
going to have different opinions of

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,920
about these sorts of things but kidding

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,360
too kind of the core of the issue

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,980
oftentimes the issue is just with a

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,770
rendering I mean borders aren't

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,740
necessarily on the ground in some cases

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:32,280
we might have fences or demarcations but

00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:35,410
in essence we are just trying to map

00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:38,770
administrative boundaries so for now we

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:43,090
generally follow this policy which is

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:44,620
sort of de facto that's basically

00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:48,730
looking at just on the ground situation

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:52,980
so so what's going on there and we try

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:56,380
to meet reality which again may not be

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,960
what some people view as that but we

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,330
want to try to capture the things that

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:05,140
are going on on the ground

00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:06,970
and the other thing here is that you

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,529
know we're just a database we're not

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,750
authoritative we're not saying that

00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:12,670
these borders are explicitly this case

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,430
we're just trying to provide some data

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,290
for people to look at now looking at

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,850
this last line here in the future we may

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,610
look at supporting alternative sets

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,800
directly I think that's something that

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,890
we might want to move towards sometime

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,899
in the near future especially with

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:31,029
vector maps becoming more popular so in

00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:32,829
terms of international borders for the

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,959
future one thing would be just to keep

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:37,089
this status quo principle of de facto

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,540
borders so looking at on the ground

00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,980
situation something that I've seen on

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,540
the mailing list before this postal

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,240
principle so if you want to mail a

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,589
letter to someone in some territory what

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,230
sort of country do you put on that

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:53,560
letter what country is providing postal

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:56,829
service those sorts of things a second

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,320
one would be to create super relations

00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:03,430
that hold these different viewpoints so

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:06,250
say you have a country you have in one

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,079
case a relation that defines this de

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,470
facto border that's kind of what we're

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,450
in it what's rendered on OSN org but

00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,310
then there's also this country's view

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,490
the border so what you could do is say

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,959
if you had a vector tiles you could have

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,209
essentially different localizations for

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,649
each country so if someone was visiting

00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:26,200
a map from China they could pull in that

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:30,040
China vectors for borders or if someone

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,420
was visiting it from somewhere in Europe

00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,770
they could pull in say the Belgium

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,730
borders and see those different things

00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:38,500
and then finally we could just get rid

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,510
of them altogether since they're not

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,070
even on the ground so that's something

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:46,390
that's also been bounced around before

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:50,640
and it could be a possibility so with

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,640
that I guess I will finish up thank you

00:14:50,860 --> 00:15:06,100
I guess we're gonna do a few questions

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:09,840
now thank you this was a very

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:12,070
interesting I have to say so the main

00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:16,240
phrase I'm going to remember from this

00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:18,060
is physical control this is how you this

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:24,010
is the principle there's behind

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:26,890
everything you you do it seems DWG but

00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:29,730
what about your interactions with you

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:32,680
know the US state or with legal

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:36,210
arrangements how do you integrate them

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:39,070
in your in your process thanks a lot

00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:43,930
yeah I mean I think it it depends on the

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:46,750
situation in in most of these cases we

00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:49,540
have usually one member of the team has

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,160
provided you know some of their time to

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,010
actually research these more in-depth I

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,020
mean most most of these these border

00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,910
rules can't necessarily be applied

00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,560
uniformly across all situations so I

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:03,310
think in every case it just requires

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,680
looking at it more closely someone doing

00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:08,230
some research to see all these different

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,790
you know situations going on the

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,980
different claims that sort of thing to

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,170
see what what's happening there so I

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,690
don't think there's a complete uniform

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:19,290
set that we can apply to these sorts of

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,290
agreements

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:37,370
since I've been on the receiving end of

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:39,730
some of the complaints with yes I should

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,730
know better

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,390
I've been on the receiving end of some

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,760
of the complaints so that's why I have a

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:50,930
comment here and I was co-author of that

00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:53,270
document I think a useful way of looking

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,240
at it is actually one which I actually

00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:57,950
works particularly say Northern Cyprus

00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,330
your tourists on Cyprus you're in your

00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:04,579
car you have a map in your sat-nav

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:06,829
system and you really want to know if

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,820
you're staying in the same country or

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:14,780
not and you it's not a useful

00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:16,670
information to know okay the Salvin part

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,400
of southern part of Cyprus doesn't

00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,540
believe that there's an orphan part

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,990
because you'll just get shot when you

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:26,300
drive over the border and I think that's

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,480
something which works well as an

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:32,030
argument the people that have been

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:36,380
proposing adding all these disputed

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:38,600
boundaries to osm don't understand that

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,720
is essentially no country in the world

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,260
which doesn't actually have it border

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,480
conflicts which then has one with Italy

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:52,100
you know they're not fighting about it

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,320
but they're still there and you just it

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,420
would actually open the Pandora's box

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,860
because then you would give people the

00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,050
possibility say yeah but you'll be

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,330
showing that said that saying always aim

00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:07,040
and not the safe that my neighbor

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:10,570
country has so I'm very much for keeping

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,570
the current status quo

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,670
yet I just kind of agree with with your

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,800
statement especially about traveling

00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,670
because that's what we're you know

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,040
that's what we envision with

00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,990
OpenStreetMap is what people are gonna

00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:32,120
be using this data how will that affect

00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:34,220
them locally what is your approach for

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,130
situations where the official street

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,260
names for instance are different from

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:42,920
what is used by people or ally for

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:47,120
instance on the ground in terms of

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:50,090
language or just a specific name I'm

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:55,430
rather amend the names like maybe the

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:58,190
street is named yeah yeah I mean what

00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:01,400
the language also maybe yeah yeah just

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,870
I think the tagging schema provides a

00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,840
good opportunity for that looking at

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:09,830
like names all names specific localized

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,960
names in terms of whether a name should

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,430
be an old name should be applied to the

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,750
actual name like in parentheses or

00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,970
something I think would depend on the

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:21,790
situation but but there are tags that

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,790
can be used to distinguish between those

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,770
I'm also on the data working group and

00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:34,600
have dealt with street names in a few

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:38,120
cases generally for the name tag it's

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,160
what is the sign there on the ground I

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,740
mean that doesn't mean that if someone

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,870
vandalizes a nametag by writing a letter

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,800
and it's fixed next week we would change

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:51,050
the name tag but just because City Hall

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,300
has decided all these streets now are

00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:57,290
renamed but hasn't actually changed the

00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:59,750
signage you would in that case keep the

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:02,210
name tag and maybe had an official name

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,790
tag where it gets complicated is where

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:09,770
you have one Street multiple name tags

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:11,260
that all disagree and there's not a

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,700
great solution there

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:17,030
this isn't somewhere like Belgium this

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:20,570
is somewhere like generally Eastern

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,160
Europe where you have one name on street

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,860
signs you have one name on the side of

00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,690
houses you

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:30,120
name addresses you have another name

00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:34,260
that the city believes it is and none of

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:36,660
these may agree and because these are oh

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:40,170
this also gets into multiple languages

00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:42,660
and cultural identity people can feel

00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:46,320
very strongly about this so it's hard to

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:50,160
come to a resolution that everyone

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,299
agrees on whereas for Belgium what they

00:20:50,160 --> 00:21:01,950
have there are multiple names here but

00:20:53,299 --> 00:21:10,830
there is agreement on how to do that one

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:13,020
last question maybe just not a question

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:16,320
but just a comment I would simply saw a

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,450
documentary about how Google map manages

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,250
such situation and I thought it was

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,679
quite interesting so of course you have

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,660
the this situational occurs in many

00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:28,080
places and the way they have solved it

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:33,090
is to show a different map depending on

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:35,790
from who is taking the map so if it's if

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:40,169
let's take the example of Crimea which

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:41,940
was has been annexed by Russia if you if

00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:44,610
you check the map from Russia from

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,320
Crimea you will see it as part of Russia

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,230
if you check it from the rest of the

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,809
world you see it still part of Ukraine

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:54,929
which is in a way quite pregnant quite

00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:57,450
pragmatic because it's what you would

00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:59,940
see if you were checking a paper map for

00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,740
vu you will have that in Russia you

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,309
would you would get a Russian map which

00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,890
shows come here as part of Russia and in

00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:09,690
the rest of the world reverse so ok but

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,000
uh of course it's I don't know if it's

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,200
easy to implement or if that's the the

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,890
way that should be followed here but

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,799
it's just an example of how they do it

00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:21,299
yeah and I think the other thing like

00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,610
you kind of bring up here is a lot of

00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:25,740
this is focused or a lot of this can be

00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:27,780
mitigated based on who is actually

00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,610
rendering the map so you know anyone

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,200
could take the database they can modify

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,730
it how they want or they can just render

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,240
all these different localizations like

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,100
you mentioned I think the issue that

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,470
happens though is that people just go to

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,179
the OSN org map and if it's not right on

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:44,490
there then they think that the data is

00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,809
you know completely wrong but I think

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,850
that's a good solution especially when

00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:55,830
countries start dictating that data has

00:22:47,850 --> 00:23:00,360
to be right quick follow-up why Frederic

00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:02,010
is going to stage and think it and there

00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,559
is actually some map rendering software

00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,390
that was just ash from some people in

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,520
Japan I think and if it's from a

00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:15,630
Japanese IP it does this and if it's

00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:18,350
because there's a Islands dispute so so

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,350
