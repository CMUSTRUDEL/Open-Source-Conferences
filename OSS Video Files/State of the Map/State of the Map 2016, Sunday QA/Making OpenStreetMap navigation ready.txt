Title: Making OpenStreetMap navigation ready
Publication date: 2016-10-20
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Sunday QA
Description:

Map data is increasingly playing a critical role in a world - from smart navigation, to looking towards improved energy efficiency and reducing impact on the environment. More and more users are contributing to OpenStreetMap daily, and the platform already allows for versatile routing for pedestrians, bicycles, and cars, but critical gaps in the data prohibits us from tapping into its full navigation capability.

In this interactive workshop, weâ€™ll look at the gaps and explore tagging schemes, editing tools, visualizations and workflows, and add turn-restriction, turn-lane and bicycle lane data to enhance the navigation potential of OpenStreetMap. At the end of the session, you will have quickly built the incredible skills to create navigation ready data in and around your community.

okay let's start my name is Aaron I work

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,710
with the MapBox team based out of India

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,639
and we do a lot of mapping there on

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,020
OpenStreetMap and so the talk was going

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,480
to be by my colleague Ramya

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,090
but she's just unwell so I'm gonna take

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,460
over and what I wanted to talk about was

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,050
what her team has been doing nothing on

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,740
OpenStreetMap many of you might have

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,230
been seeing our projects mapping in us

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,200
in Canada in Europe so this is just a

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,920
high level overview of what's been going

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,140
on why we're doing it and yeah why it's

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,110
needed on the map and it's going to

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,420
interest a lot of you who are doing

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,610
services on top of OpenStreetMap for

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,879
navigation and it's a good time to also

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,449
think about how we can all collaborate

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,780
to actually make a much more useful

00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:02,609
OpenStreetMap so to start with I started

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,260
mapping in 2006 I think and much like

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,420
many of us here who started mapping

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,320
early you have been mapping move for

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,810
cartography then anything else to fill

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,290
up the map to make it look more complete

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:22,470
and yeah this is an example in Brussels

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:23,939
itself that it's amazingly detailed and

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,030
it's just astounding how much of detail

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,060
we have and this is great like visually

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:35,040
osm is very complete in much of the

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:37,740
world but the real the real value with

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,320
maps the first most useful things with

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,390
maps is to find very hard to know that

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,460
I'm there and the next most useful thing

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,670
is to find how to get to someplace else

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,220
and this is the navigation aspect of map

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,770
which really takes the maps to the next

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:59,000
level so how many of us actually use

00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:03,840
Open Street Map for navigation oh wow

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,860
how many use it using yeah how many use

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,099
it on the mobile for navigation awesome

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,840
and

00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:16,239
and maps taught me folks nice and is

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:22,170
there any other navigator using over sim

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:28,260
which is popular sorry citymapper

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:28,260
Scout how many you Scout citymapper oh

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,769
that's awesome

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,769
sorry okay

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,750
but it's great so om is quite useful for

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,549
navigation and I think for a lot of

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,880
commercial companies including map box

00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:53,980
so using OSM the big value is in selling

00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,650
like navigation services on

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,180
OpenStreetMap and so let's look at

00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,640
behind the scenes what happens with

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,290
navigation on OS m and this is going to

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,319
be a little bit of a mapping workshop as

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,850
well to learn about how to map the

00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,780
different features that impact routing

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:17,320
and navigation and it how many jaws some

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:22,209
users your and ID users okay so we can

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:25,269
do little mojo so to start with I think

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:32,220
everyone can just open this particular

00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:34,810
guide bitly slash navigation mapping and

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,690
this is essentially a guide that we have

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,340
put together putting in a lot of

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,910
documentation from various places

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:46,060
including the OSM Viki and this came out

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,859
from our own team so essentially the big

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,060
question we are trying to answer is what

00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:53,620
does it take to make Open Street Map

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:56,019
navigable and I think a lot of us we

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,310
feel that om is navigation ready in many

00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,590
places and they already using with

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,720
navigation but we really don't know for

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,510
the rest of the world and how ready are

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,220
we how wrong is it how much more data

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,620
needs to be filled up and this is an

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,480
open question to everyone and I think

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,609
for different mapping teams as well to

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,760
figure out how to improve the map data

00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:18,740
and make it better

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,380
so from from our team

00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,600
at my box we have been doing different

00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,340
kinds of navigation mapping projects and

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,500
while doing it I've been figuring out

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,760
what are the features that impact

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:33,080
routing how to map these features and

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,430
seeing what tools are required to be

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,160
able to map these features much more

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,450
easily because clearly much of the

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,090
mapping that been doing is for

00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,730
cartography so our feedback from the

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,520
mapping is what we see on the map but

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:48,890
not exactly how the navigation works and

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,140
so there's definitely a lot of gap in

00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:55,700
terms of the tooling in OpenStreetMap

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,770
and it's it's time we all started seeing

00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,380
what are these missing tools and how to

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:03,410
make workflows better for better

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:06,980
navigation data so I'll quickly go

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,650
through what we have done here so this

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,670
is essentially a mapping guide for

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,310
improving navigation data and mapping

00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,260
and there's nothing similar which exists

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,570
anywhere else so the whole objective of

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,490
this guide was to help our own team to

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,740
understand how navigation works on Open

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,860
Street Map and what features to map and

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,540
how to map them and also give the

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,830
different technicalities because the

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,710
mapping varies from region to region

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,290
every place has its own kind of road

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:36,650
signage --is and on the ground features

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:39,830
and also as a quick introduction and

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,800
index for a lot of the documentation on

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,360
the wiki which is spread over many pages

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,740
so this became a really convenient place

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,240
for us to start so we started putting

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,910
this together and I'm sure it's going to

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,590
be useful for many other teams as well

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:55,100
and many other mappers and the whole

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,290
idea with this is to use the data we

00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,150
collect to finally improve the

00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,610
documentation that we have on the wiki

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,250
to actually benefit everyone else so

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,130
this is completely open this is on the

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:11,780
map box mething repository in the wiki

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:14,750
and completely open all the content here

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:18,920
is CC 0 it's public domain feel free to

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:24,080
use any of this for any purpose we have

00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:25,580
structured this in four parts the first

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,930
part is just an introduction to give

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,650
anybody or overview of

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,780
how Navi gation works this is for

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,740
somebody with an on map or OpenStreetMap

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,949
background and they go to the components

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,979
of navigation on the friend facing side

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:46,919
and the backend side and quickly just

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,840
describing what those are so one one

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,880
major thing is a navigation profile this

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,310
is your mode of transport that you want

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:58,130
to use for navigation your car for

00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:01,259
cycling for instance then is the routing

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:03,599
mechanism where the map data is

00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:07,050
converted to a routing graph with

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:09,919
different waves and the routing graph

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:13,410
essentially picks the best route between

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,110
points a and B based on the different

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:20,849
map features and the geometry in their

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:22,650
OS arum is a great algorithm which does

00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,910
this very quickly and this is what we

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,349
have on the main Open Street Map site

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:30,300
along with a few of those leg off

00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:32,400
grasshopper and after the routing is

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,820
done the next part is guidance so once

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,500
you have a route calculated the next

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,750
part is communicating that to the user

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,280
saying how to travel on this route and

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,070
the guidance is essentially the

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,289
instructions you would give from where

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,440
you are what instructions you need to

00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:51,300
take at every Junction to be able to

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:57,060
give you a very good experience to get

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:59,970
to your final destination and a few

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,840
things for the future on how navigation

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,580
is going to be going

00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,889
one is telemetry so a lot of services

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,509
take or use a location like Google Maps

00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:12,000
for instance takes everyone's use the

00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:14,789
location and helps build a traffic model

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,310
and something like this is very very

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:19,889
useful for predicting accurate traffic

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,070
types and without telemetry it's pretty

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,000
much impossible to give you accurate

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:28,770
estimation of how long it will take you

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,979
to get to a place the next one is

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:33,620
forward-facing cameras and Street View

00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:36,779
services like mapillary open Street View

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,520
we are really giving on-the-ground

00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,750
information and essentially doing field

00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,699
mapping you know

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,099
so it's helping remote mappers and field

00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:47,910
mappers collaborate and map without

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:51,149
actually going to a place this for

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,060
instance is a street crowded alley in

00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:56,639
India where you can't really take your

00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:00,060
car you have animals on the road and

00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:03,240
it's pretty amazing what how eyes on the

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,550
ground can actually help mappers and

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,819
having such a Demetri which is more

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:11,399
real-time using drones or near live

00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:13,220
aerial imagery this is like really super

00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,639
high resolution imagery from Sri Lanka

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:22,170
and machine learning so this is like the

00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:23,790
next big open thing on how machine

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,680
learning algorithms can actually give

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,170
very useful data about on the ground

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,699
situation so I think maybe where we are

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:34,199
heading towards is having a map which is

00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:35,519
almost live simulation of what's going

00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,589
on on the ground if there's a traffic

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,740
change or if there's a new construction

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:44,519
the map is updated near live and that's

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:56,639
probably the kind of goal that we're all

00:09:44,519 --> 00:10:00,660
working towards the second part is on

00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,949
the basic geometry nothing asthma cause

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,779
we don't really need this but this is

00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:07,199
really useful for somebody new into

00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:11,190
mapping on how to create the geometries

00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:15,290
of the road and the best practices the

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,290
basic definitions of a snored Stags

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,249
and the third part is the actual mapping

00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:27,680
guide where we have divided each type of

00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:30,589
feature and given a explanation of what

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:35,319
it is how it impacts routing the tags

00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:37,519
that's used links to the OSM wiki with

00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:40,730
explanation and workflows and how to map

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,959
the tools to use so the whole idea

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,629
behind this supposed to make it really

00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:48,800
easy for somebody to start mapping oh no

00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:50,569
SM we thought getting lost into a lot of

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,189
the documentation that's there on the

00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:53,209
wiki you don't know where to start you

00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:56,029
don't know how the different features

00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:58,519
are linked and the guide just gives a

00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,809
holistic picture even for somebody who

00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,050
does not know anything about Open Street

00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:05,569
Map maybe your company which uses a

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,040
different data model but wants to

00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:09,019
understand how the Open Street Map data

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,540
model works so this is essentially a

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:17,420
guide navigation guide for the OSM data

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:19,819
model all the features are sorted

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,100
according to the importance as well so

00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:24,470
this is the most basic thing is to have

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,600
functional Road classes and for anyone

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:30,680
working on navigation FRC is the term

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:33,639
that's used and this has understand the

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:39,529
different types of highways that 7os M

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:41,839
then you have the 1 ways and an om is

00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:44,209
pretty good in terms of functional road

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,550
classes and one ways where it starts

00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:49,279
falling back is toned restrictions and

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:53,240
this is like the goldmine for providing

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,529
really good navigation having every turn

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,879
description on the map to know that

00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:59,120
other Junction you're not a lord take a

00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:01,339
left or a right turn and once you have

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,550
all the tender sections you can provide

00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:07,069
very accurate routes from A to B you

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,629
can't give a good estimate of the time

00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:11,240
but you can provide a very accurate

00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:13,429
route and this is something that we do

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,420
there's not how many have experienced

00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:20,120
nothing to earn restrictions before all

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:25,009
right and this is using jaws zoom zoom

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,540
anyone does doing it with ID nobody cool

00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:28,490
so this

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,440
idea has a really great interface for

00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,460
mapping to interceptions and we will see

00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,460
that as well

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,680
so let's get into some mapping and we'll

00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,600
map some to and restrictions so mapping

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,840
to under striction Swilly hard for us to

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,120
do as a remote team we are we are there

00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,400
somewhere else and we want we want to

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,130
map to and restrictions starting with

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,900
the US and you can't see turn

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,300
restrictions in satellite imagery so how

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,430
do you map transcriptions we started

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,360
looking at McCleary for Street View

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,280
imagery to see which images had turned

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,380
ships and sinuses in them and using that

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,960
as a way to compare with osm and then

00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,960
map the missing data and all the tools

00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,280
to do this was really heavy on the

00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,310
computer there was so much of data

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,110
coming in and it was very cumbersome to

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,460
use and go very slow so we ended up

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,710
building our own tool and our own

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,500
workflow for mapping and I'm just going

00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,420
to quickly show you how we're doing this

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,100
so you can just open the mapping guide

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,510
I'm sure everyone knows what a turn

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,190
restriction is I'm not going to go into

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:36,110
that you can go into the mapping guide

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:37,370
for two instructions and this is what we

00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,290
have built we have built this tool

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:43,400
called the OSM navigation map which

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:45,500
allows us as napo's to quickly go

00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,190
through mapillary images and add missing

00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,160
two interceptions

00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:53,780
so we'll do a full tour of this you can

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,550
just open the navigation map it has

00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:58,540
documentation of how to use it but I can

00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,540
give you a tour

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:14,220
yeah this is what it looks like and all

00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:16,319
these purple boundaries you're seeing

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,540
was the project cities that we are

00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,790
chosen for mapping and it was mostly

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,079
based on population so this also gives

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,360
you an idea of the cities that were

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,220
working on from the map box mapping team

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,620
where they are been adding to

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,870
instructions so we essentially get a

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,430
team divided on each city one by one and

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:38,999
work through them to map missing data

00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:41,449
and let's take a good example let's go

00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,449
to Brussels

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,319
it is a missing tile you're gonna reload

00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,319
that

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,800
okay what we're seeing here is all these

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,990
white trails are mapillary coverage in

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,840
Brussels so each one is a mapillary

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,550
sequence of a mapper a contributor

00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:22,860
I'm sure a lot of them is from Phillipe

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:26,650
he's right here and this is great

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:30,220
there's pretty much 100% coverage in the

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:32,800
city center what we can do with the

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,590
awesome navigation map is we can see

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,280
existing turn restrictions they shown up

00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:42,460
with blue and these red markers so each

00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:47,830
one is a turn restriction also if we

00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:51,550
zoom in after I think zoom well we

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:53,470
should see signage is like these so map

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,740
3 does something really cool with all

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,380
the street view images they do image

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,970
processing on them and capture Street

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,670
signage is that they detect on the

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:07,420
images and tag those images and they

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:09,130
release this data as a separate tile so

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,080
essentially what we do is we load them

00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,240
onto the map and just filter out turn

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,950
restrictions you can also do them for

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,200
any other kind of sign stop signs

00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:20,110
priority giveaway

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,970
they're all there there's around fifty

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,470
two hundred signs traffic signs and

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,690
mapped area detects we have just

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,790
filtered the transcription once and put

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,970
an icon there to visualize them so those

00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,270
are mandatory straight to instructions

00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,270
on the road

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:45,410
and as we zoom in we get the satellite

00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:51,130
imagery how we work with this is we

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:55,430
click on the sign and what happens is

00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:57,500
mercury also approximates the possible

00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,480
location of the sign so this is not the

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,510
location of the photograph but it's the

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,510
location of the actual street sign which

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:08,000
is determined by their algorithm and

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,949
clicking on that sign shows up the

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,770
photographs which detected that sign so

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,670
there's three photographs here and

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:17,170
clicking on any of them

00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:20,060
should open the actual mapillary image

00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:23,230
yeah there it is if I just click on it

00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,230
you get the full view

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,620
and we also have the tools here to

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,070
browse through the sequence so we can go

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,760
through it

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:38,350
so even though we are remote McCleary

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,480
and browsing through the map this way

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,700
really helps understand the context to

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,880
where the signage is located where the

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,440
photographs is captured and where the

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,870
possible restriction could be so we know

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,520
there's a know essentially this sign

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:55,930
means you can't take a right onto that

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,000
road so all cars have to go straight

00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,700
nobody's allowed to turn a right so

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,510
there's essentially or no right turn the

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:07,600
ships in here we have one more option

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:14,140
here for one-ways yeah if I turn that on

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:15,700
it shows me one-way roads on osm so this

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,340
is essentially a one-way road which goes

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:23,170
into this direction so essentially

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,610
because this is a one-way road the

00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,340
routing algorithm will not route you

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:29,980
right on this Junction so there's no

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,480
need for us to map a turn restriction

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,310
here because it's redundant information

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,420
for the routing algorithm and for the

00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:39,970
map so what we do here is we make a

00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:43,350
review that we have a couple of options

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,910
here for reviewing the Reta valid means

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,160
it's data you've added to the map it's

00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,750
correct

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,190
essentially means that it's correct but

00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,850
it's not required to add to the map in

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:57,220
this case it's a redundant information

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:59,320
invalid is a false detection it's not a

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,520
turn restriction or it was directed

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:06,040
incorrectly by the mapper algorithm and

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,470
note is when you're not really sure we

00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:14,530
add a note to the map to allow local map

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:16,060
was to verify and I just hit save and

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:21,460
this is just recorded on the map you can

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:22,960
see this orange symbol this lets the

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,550
team know that someone's already

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,500
reviewed this restriction and there's no

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,060
reason to review this again and the self

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,690
second other mappers if they collaborate

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,690
on this tool that

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,810
it helps other muscles know that this

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:49,190
area has been checked and there's no

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:50,690
reason to review it again so one more

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,630
issue we faced while trying to do this

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,790
is how to divide the map because in

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:59,000
tasking manager it's easy to divide your

00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:00,980
tasks but in a workflow like this

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,950
everyone's working on the map and we

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:08,260
don't really know who's well so we added

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,260
one more option to have a tile grid

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:22,580
yes so the tile boundaries shows up zoom

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,740
10 tile Montrese which allows us to

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,010
specify and divide the team saying that

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,870
Oh

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,750
I'll work on these tiles you work on

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,600
these tiles and recover the thing so Oh

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,850
this tool and this workflow really

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,420
simplified the whole process what used

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:42,650
to take as many days to finish one city

00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:45,260
and add 10 turn restrictions started

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,300
taking us much faster using this

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,630
workflow and we realized the importance

00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,980
of having really optimized tools and

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,410
having good workflows to be able to do

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,940
this before this we had to go to Jos

00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,280
room we had to use the map degree plugin

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,230
we uploaded a lot of data and the plug

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,700
plugins would crash if there's too much

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:06,500
of data is very hard to browse through

00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:09,560
the UI and to go back and forth with

00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,780
this tool and this is a pretty simple -

00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,220
there's not it's not very complex to

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:19,670
build it took us a week in development

00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:22,760
we managed to shift the whole process of

00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:26,180
decision-making into the browser that we

00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,560
use all the sources and osm data

00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,450
available here to make the decision

00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,880
whether we should map or not what data

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,800
is missing and finally when we know what

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,670
to do we go into Jotham or ID and

00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,320
actually make the change I'm not sure if

00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,840
this any missing two interceptions

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,060
you're we haven't done it but let's see

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,920
how to understand is actually mapped for

00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,200
some of you who don't know it and I'm

00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,760
going to show it with ID ang awesome so

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,930
that you can compare the different

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,380
workflows so the Edit map should take us

00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,380
to ID

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,180
okay so note those of us were power

00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,910
mappers probably have never touched ID

00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,380
and but ID is great I think there's a

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,970
lot of great work happening on ID to

00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,490
simplify the whole mapping process and

00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,750
in future all those complex things

00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,690
you're doing inch awesome could just be

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:25,810
done in ID so let's say we want how to

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,790
turn restriction here from this road to

00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,490
this road you can't take a right on this

00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:36,600
road the way to do it an ID is fairly

00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:36,600
simple you select the two segments Oh

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,000
actually you don't need to select the

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:46,500
segments you can just select the

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,500
junction point and

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:56,470
Oh uses use shift yeah if you want to

00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:57,460
select multiple objects you can hold

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,929
shift and you can select multiple

00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:04,179
objects so in this case we won't have to

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:05,289
know right over here so we just click on

00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:08,080
the junction where you won't have the

00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:09,700
restriction we click on the way from

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,070
which we won't have to turn restriction

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,710
and this shows all possible turns from

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,940
this way why are the junction and if

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,769
there's a no right we just click this

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:22,239
and this is your no right and that's

00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:24,220
done and think of how we do it in

00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:26,730
Johnson and we can see how we do the

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,730
same thing is awesome

00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:55,030
you know one is it's really slow because

00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:59,860
so much of data let's see where we want

00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:01,390
other restriction yeah I'm gonna add one

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,200
here you first need to split your way

00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:11,200
properly if I need to add a restriction

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:20,110
you have to split this I usually select

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:30,220
the ways I go to my presets choose

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:30,940
restriction I just say ok here and oh no

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,970
what did I do

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:38,860
I don't even know okay I'm not gonna try

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:42,820
this I'm not sure what I did wrong

00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:45,390
though who can guide me orally on adding

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,390
a transcription

00:24:52,900 --> 00:25:00,960
okay my jaw Simmons is acting up okay

00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,780
I'm not gonna do this

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,059
yeah but essentially you can use ID for

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,600
adding two intersections highly

00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:12,520
recommended you can't make a mistake and

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,980
ID also adds the tag so you have the tag

00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,170
view in case you want to modify it for

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,740
adding conditional turn restrictions and

00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:23,170
the timings so this is the awesome

00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,790
navigation map we built it for

00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:27,010
visualizing a lot of the navigation data

00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,900
for now it's don't restrict shion's but

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:32,410
future plans is to have things like

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:35,170
speed limits lane attributes turn lanes

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:37,600
all in one place so a lot of the mapping

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,010
can be done in the same tool and we

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,290
initially thought of doing a jossen

00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:43,030
plugin but it was just way more

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,130
difficult than just creating this just

00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:48,610
took a week to do the code is open for

00:25:45,130 --> 00:26:03,220
this feel free to fork it somewhere else

00:25:48,610 --> 00:26:04,809
make improvements some stats of how much

00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,820
mapping you've done in the last three

00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:08,440
months since we did this we have

00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,740
reviewed over nine thousand six hundred

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,130
images four thousand four hundred have

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,320
been valid a lot of them is actually not

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,090
needed to add on OpenStreetMap and there

00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,220
is a lot of false protections in map

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,660
Larry so this data also had some

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,350
uploading improve the algorithm for

00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,350
better directions

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:41,590
these are few of the cities that we

00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:44,890
would be mapping in the coming time so a

00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:48,150
little bit about are there many German

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,150
mappers you from the German community

00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,290
yeah

00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:55,540
Simon almost going up so interestingly

00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:59,800
when when we do our mapping projects we

00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:01,960
usually give the community some advance

00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:05,220
notification that our team is going to

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,270
come and try to map and add missing data

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,380
with what is the workflow we are

00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,080
following and how we are going to do

00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,270
this and if there's any improvements

00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,340
that they would like in the workflow or

00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:17,350
if you should not do it and Germany was

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:21,730
a very interesting case so because the

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:23,800
US and Canada had they're very happy for

00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,900
somebody to add missing data in Germany

00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,280
it was very different where the feeling

00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,700
was that the data is complete and there

00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:33,310
was nothing more to add but we still did

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,410
this we didn't do any mapping as such in

00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:39,130
Germany but instead we chose to add

00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:41,140
notes on the map and over three days we

00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:45,570
reviewed three cities Berlin Stuttgart

00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:48,220
Munich and we did manage to find around

00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:51,640
92 own decisions which were potentially

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,740
missing in these three cities and around

00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,780
half those notes have been resolved by

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,130
the community very quickly so the

00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,350
community is extremely active in this

00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,540
but also goes to show that you don't

00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,550
need to be on the ground to be able to

00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,860
map something on the ground electron

00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:07,870
descriptions tools like Malory and

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,510
strictly you actually help fill those

00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:14,770
missing gaps and it is very valuable to

00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:16,840
do I'm not sure if this anyone from the

00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,820
German community who have seen the

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,620
mapping that our team has done and has

00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:26,050
any feedback it'll be great to actually

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:31,080
hear any observations from you anything

00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:31,080
to say okay if not it's

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,340
so this is the awesome navigation lab

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:39,340
which we are using for turn restrictions

00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,950
and a lot of the upcoming projects now

00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:46,080
is going to be on two instructions for

00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:49,840
many of the well map cities in US Europe

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,630
North America and large cities in Asia

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,950
so for those of the cities that we're

00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,560
not yet covered you can expect us to

00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:59,350
come and add missing to indiscretions

00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:02,020
and it'd also be great to have more

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:04,570
mapillary users this is also great for

00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,960
mapillary users like Phillipe to know

00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:10,150
how all the street photographs are being

00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,340
used and this makes a huge difference to

00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:20,560
grouting and all the services that gets

00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:23,200
built on top of Open Street Map speed

00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,170
limits so from our experience with

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:30,100
routing speed limit having them mapped

00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:33,370
helps but in many cases especially in

00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:35,590
city centers does not really help

00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,330
because the speed limit may be 40 km/h

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:40,360
be the actual traveling speed might be

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:43,050
much lower so it definitely helps but

00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:47,200
it's really not that high in priority on

00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:50,590
having a big impact on the routing the

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,810
time estimates and then you have access

00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,700
restrictions so this is essentially tags

00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:58,780
would say that what type of vehicles are

00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:01,120
allowed by default anyway on osm is a

00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:04,390
public way and if it's not it usually

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,260
has access tag which defines what type

00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:10,620
of vehicle is allowed and not allowed

00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:13,300
and then we have two traffic signals and

00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,850
this is used in routing algorithms to

00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,680
add or turn penalty that the more

00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,860
traffic signals you cross there is a

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:26,500
certain impact to the speed you can go

00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:28,570
on that road so these are all the

00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,980
routing of features which impact the

00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,590
actual route calculation in the

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,140
algorithm once that is done the next

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:38,170
part is guidance features and this

00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,210
really helps improve the experience one

00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:44,840
can provide with navigation to the end

00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:47,120
user the features which impact this

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,429
the exit and destination science so

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,470
these are essentially signs on freeways

00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:55,549
and motorways

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:57,919
which which allows the driver on a

00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:00,470
particular exit number or where a

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,909
particular road leads to so this is the

00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:06,169
exit sign and this is a destination sign

00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:08,330
this is really critical on motorways

00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:09,830
because you miss one of these or you

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,450
give a wrong instruction and you have to

00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,309
take like the power of many kilometers

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:18,230
and that really gives a very bad

00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:21,950
experience when you're navigating the

00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:27,620
workflow we follow for this so we have a

00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:35,779
detailed guide just quickly go through

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:38,720
this this is a full explanation of exit

00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:41,090
tags and destination tags one thing to

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,210
note with destination tags is there's

00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:47,210
different tagging conventions used in

00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:49,909
Germany and in North America that I

00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:54,169
think of old tagging scheme was to mark

00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:56,090
the destination signs on the node but

00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:58,610
the new one is to market on the way and

00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:01,490
this caused a bit of confusion for us

00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:04,250
and I'm not sure if this discussion in

00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,870
the German community to shift or how to

00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,549
migrate this to a new scheme or if

00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:10,370
things should be as it is but at the

00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:12,350
moment I think including over Sodom it

00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,270
handles both schemes but there are

00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,330
certain places where this causes

00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:19,340
confusion it's not possible for the

00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:24,649
algorithm to determine which way goes to

00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:26,870
which destination the tool be used for

00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:29,330
adding exit and destination is check

00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:33,970
auto pistol - this is a really great

00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,970
tool built by a community member

00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:48,820
what this does is it looks for all the

00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:51,850
route relations in a particular part of

00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:55,679
the map so if I click on this it should

00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,679
get all the highways that pass through

00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,160
it's probably a lot of highways

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,929
I think I'll take a smaller section

00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:33,549
yeah once that's done now you can

00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:36,159
download the entire route and visualize

00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:41,169
it on the map and this is like a QA

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:44,619
checker for a particular highway and the

00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:46,570
symbols essentially represent what what

00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:50,499
the level of the mapping at each

00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:53,159
Junction is so each one represents or

00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:53,159
exit number

00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:10,220
yes oh so the red symbols are

00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:13,100
essentially exits with no exit number or

00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,320
destination and they have a detailed

00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,149
legend on how this works so what we do

00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,639
is we essentially look at each highway

00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:21,950
in the area of interest and we find out

00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,530
where there's potential data missing and

00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:26,840
then we use mercury as a source to find

00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,030
out if there's images which capture the

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,909
street sign at the location and then add

00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:34,609
the missing data we also check for the

00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:36,770
date of capture of the imagery to make

00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:42,169
sure that it's not outdated imaging are

00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:45,109
these professions for exiting this

00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:47,090
destination though Europe is very well

00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:48,800
covered I think there's some amazing

00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:53,169
detailed mapping that's happened here

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,169
and there's not too much of data missing

00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,480
it's its exit out of a motorway

00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:13,720
this question was what exactly is an

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:19,150
exit in my opinion an exit out of a

00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:21,370
freeway so if one motorway leads to

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:27,520
another mode way what do you call it

00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:31,630
then it's an exit from the motorway yeah

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,060
it's it's a motorway exit yeah because I

00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,500
see a lot of well there is a little bit

00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,760
of difference at least in Netherlands

00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,510
between an exit leading to a

00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:43,720
lower-ranking motorway this should all

00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:45,790
be covered as far as I know but the

00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:50,590
exits leading to another motorway which

00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:54,070
you highlight it on the red there they

00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:57,670
are different they attack with motorway

00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:59,680
Junction but it's only leading to

00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,510
another motorway okay and they don't

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,430
have a number they don't have a number

00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,950
in the Netherlands okay and there's no

00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:07,960
specific tags for such kind of exits you

00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:10,870
consume it's a mapillary if if it's

00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:15,160
possible there's a lot of photos there

00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:18,550
so you can see it okay so it might be an

00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:22,800
idea to get also for me to get into

00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:26,320
contact with you to avoid redundant

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:30,130
flagging alright these are things to be

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:32,320
figured out I think even that even the

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,630
visualization style is maybe based more

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,010
in North America and it doesn't work

00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,100
throughout the world and every country

00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:40,900
really has their own system

00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,910
and the big issue when we do mapping

00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,400
projects is to find out how a local

00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:49,440
system works and how our tools can be

00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,730
adapted for the local conditions and

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,730
yeah it would be great if there was some

00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,990
tagging scheme which kind of would

00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,840
standardize this thing throughout the

00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,090
world but it's probably a long way off

00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:03,490
it'll be a great way to find out though

00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:05,920
how to find out gaps in the data like

00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:09,340
for instance when if we want to do all

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,420
the motorways in the Netherlands do we

00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,240
actually have to go through the whole

00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,040
thing

00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,230
is there some way to actually mark the

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,790
whole thing as complete and if there is

00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:19,070
then where do you marketers complete

00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:23,410
like how does one clearly know the data

00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:28,310
is up to date that's I think open

00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:30,860
question but this is the primary tool

00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:34,610
that we use for adding missing data for

00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:41,990
exit and estimation in the highway

00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:45,560
network the next one is turn lanes so

00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:48,350
turn lanes help turn lanes are lanes in

00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,360
your road junctions would say that you

00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,560
have three lanes here on the left mostly

00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,380
and you can take a left on the middle

00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,850
two lanes you can go straight and on the

00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:59,540
right mostly and you can go right and

00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:01,160
now this really helps guidance to give

00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:05,080
you those little icons to tell you which

00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,080
lane to take for a particular tone and

00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,990
if you haven't done this in Europe we

00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,650
have done this a lot in North America

00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:17,150
and I don't know if we can see it so

00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,910
clearly in the satellite imagery in

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,830
Europe yet and not sure the status of

00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:25,359
turn lanes in Europe does anyone know is

00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:25,359
it is a lot of mapping

00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:39,030
hello so there was a project in that so

00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:42,490
the Germans have this one assignment and

00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:44,440
then they it's more than a week that

00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,420
they worked on it and they mapped all

00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,380
Turtle lanes or tried to map all turn

00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:52,240
lanes and I did the same for flowers

00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,860
it's pretty well mapped and the project

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,290
also took off in other European

00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,300
countries so they still have statistics

00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:01,060
for each country in the world how many

00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,760
turn when zero are well is there a

00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:09,160
particular mechanism to update turn

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:11,830
lanes like how does one no no they just

00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,750
use satellite images and looked at the

00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:16,450
lanes because the quality was good

00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:19,990
enough to do that or they went to that

00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:22,330
place and then they just mapped it for

00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:25,060
the first time actually in most cases so

00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:27,990
I don't know when it's is outdated then

00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:30,460
yeah the same problem as with all data

00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:34,030
it's hard to find the places where it

00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:36,280
changed yeah this is a really difficult

00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,810
problem and it's not really clear how

00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,000
this will be solved on OpenStreetMap

00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:42,220
that it's so easy to fill in missing

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,710
data and not base data but how do we

00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,510
keep maintaining this and how do we flag

00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,390
changes from the real world we need a

00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:51,400
lot of community mappers which is great

00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:54,010
for neighborhoods but then in between

00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,580
cities and places where there is nobody

00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:59,440
really living there's no really simple

00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:02,470
mechanism to be able to update the map

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,780
regularly and this is probably where

00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,250
things like machine learning on imagery

00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:10,180
and friend placing cameras could be

00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:13,510
helping later so here we have the guides

00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:18,280
on how we map turn lanes it's done using

00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:22,960
pipes so like a very simple for someone

00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:25,060
who's never map turn lanes in a place

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,410
like this you have like two turn lanes

00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:32,830
and the way it's tagged is the key is

00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:35,170
stone : lanes and you ID the tone you

00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:38,650
could make they're separated by a pipe

00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:41,140
for the lane marking and if you are

00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:44,700
multiple you just put a semicolon

00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,700
so that's left and left

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:53,240
and it gets really complex for one-way

00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:55,940
roads and two-way roads you end up with

00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:59,480
so the same if it's not a one-way route

00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,070
like in this case there's no physical

00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,130
barrier between the two carriageway so

00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:06,560
you just have one single way you need to

00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,530
do something really convoluted like this

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,550
saying that this is a turn lane in the

00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:17,150
backward direction of the OS MV and this

00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:19,280
is the turn lanes and there's no good UI

00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:29,270
or tool to help in this kind of mapping

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:30,800
and it's okay if at the data team we did

00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,420
make a jostle plugin I'm not sure if

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,690
it's the same thing it's called the turn

00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:38,120
lanes plugin but it's not really

00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:41,420
publicized - well I think we have the

00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,950
link somewhere here and there is certain

00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,630
edge cases where it doesn't handle it

00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:47,000
too well so it does require a little

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:52,730
more effort but this is something

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:55,640
missing an ID completely in Joseph you

00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:58,520
also have a sheet that shows the result

00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:01,220
of the tags you you put so you can see

00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,100
if they are right or wrong that oh yes I

00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,750
do the feedback from the text and

00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,760
absolutely so this is something we use I

00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:11,140
don't know if there's a we don't have a

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,140
photo illustrating this

00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:32,820
yeah this is the one and this visualizes

00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:35,100
the turn lanes nopt so you can visually

00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,450
see if you've made a mistake and it's

00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:40,080
very easy to make a mistake when you

00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:43,590
manually type turn lanes turn in tags in

00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:45,810
Zossen ID has no real support for turn

00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:49,650
lanes yet it's really your pain to map

00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:51,890
and this is something which is highly

00:42:49,650 --> 00:43:07,110
valuable for giving very nice guidance

00:42:51,890 --> 00:43:11,010
to users navigating with autism the

00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:14,370
other one is the lane count this is I'm

00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:18,030
not sure if OSR amuses the lane count

00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:20,160
attribute too much though for the

00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:21,840
routing but this essentially covers the

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,300
whole range of mapping features that is

00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,460
that primarily impacts routing and

00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:31,020
guidance so the whole navigation using

00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:34,730
OpenStreetMap and right at the top

00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:37,410
there's a query for navigation data and

00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:39,320
if anyone is curious about the status of

00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,580
navigation data in their own map

00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,970
wherever they live they can just try out

00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,970
this query

00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,020
and this overpass query should quickly

00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,120
give you the different types of

00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,550
navigation features in your area of the

00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,590
map so you get an idea of what is there

00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,930
and this is really important because we

00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:08,740
don't really see navigation data on the

00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:10,180
map and as someone the only way for

00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:13,330
feedback has to have some kind of visual

00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:16,120
feedback when you map and this should

00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:19,630
really help but yeah this is again an

00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:22,270
open call for creating better tools how

00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:24,550
do we render these kind of features on

00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:28,030
the map to give quick feedback to

00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:29,980
mappers that which also encourages them

00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:34,360
to add correct information and add more

00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:36,010
navigation data over to the map yeah

00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,860
this this kind of covers the whole

00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:49,180
overview of the talk and just gonna open

00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:53,710
it up for folks sorry as I for I pointed

00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:56,500
out today I'm bit hard just a meaty to

00:44:53,710 --> 00:45:00,910
the last point you said I think the Holy

00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:04,780
Grail is still having near immediate

00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:08,260
routing feedback that's actually very

00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:12,940
difficult before SRM and switch then we

00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:18,100
run a our own or SRM instance on a Swiss

00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:21,250
extract and update update that fight 82

00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:24,940
times a day sorry which already helps

00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:27,310
but well so used to immediate feedback

00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:30,450
you know you really would need something

00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:33,730
which would work within five minutes

00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:36,070
could be a Johnson plugin or something

00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:38,190
like that I believe there's no Justin

00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:41,980
routing plugin but that actually doesn't

00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:43,600
understand all the Noi new and modern

00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,610
stuff so that might be something that

00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,100
could be worked on

00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:52,470
and the other point is I just wanted to

00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:54,880
make a shameless plug Vespucci has a

00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:59,580
jurisdiction adding mode which you can

00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,140
use which auto splits the ways and so on

00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:05,590
send a new version which went out on

00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:07,600
Friday and it has something which I

00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:10,090
believe no other editor currently has it

00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,760
actually has an editor for conditional

00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:17,550
access restrictions which is not so

00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:20,800
interesting for OS RM but for on device

00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:23,470
Reuters that can actually take time of

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:28,180
day and so on into account it's not she

00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:31,180
interesting thank you

00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:32,770
I'm gonna anticipate some questions so

00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,630
there's loads of stuff happening in this

00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:39,130
space in OpenStreetMap we've had a bit

00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:40,840
of a interactive session just now so

00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,790
maybe if you know about something that

00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,760
Aaron doesn't know or you think someone

00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:47,110
doesn't know like communicate later and

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,390
try and update things like his

00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:51,130
documentation or the wiki page that we

00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,680
can link to all these different tools

00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:56,350
and stalls and taking things so we're

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,710
not duplicating work could be great went

00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:05,370
it next question where am i running to

00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:05,370
unity would I to ask a question sorry

00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:15,790
okay what do you suggest if the pictures

00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:23,470
on mapillary and the actually mapping is

00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:27,460
different for put you do situations like

00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:31,270
that we usually add a note to the map to

00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:33,700
get local information from there so we

00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:36,610
try to see the history of the place to

00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:39,970
see if the data is older than the

00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:41,980
mapillary image and if it is we go ahead

00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:44,560
and change and then it's a good idea to

00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:46,900
change the data but if it's not you

00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:50,820
probably want to ask a local mapper to

00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,820
find out what exactly the situation is

00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:06,369
how well do turn restrictions work or

00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:08,890
sort of so turn lanes work when you're

00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:10,900
approaching a roundabout can you just

00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,270
use left-right does it cope with

00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:18,280
roundabouts complex roundabouts with

00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:22,000
five or six John exits yeah actually

00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:25,089
haven't come across those situations I

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,260
think US has a very few roundabouts yes

00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:33,250
I don't know I think it's a very UK

00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:35,650
centric question phil was very claimed

00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:37,480
that he didn't even ask about magic

00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,849
roundabouts we have a few in the UK

00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,859
where you can go the wrong way round a

00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:43,599
roundabout because it's got mini

00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:46,510
roundabouts within the roundabout they

00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,720
don't he was kind to you take the husk

00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:55,720
of about that T that's many it's more

00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:57,880
than the US we've got question here how

00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,369
do you mark the lanes when there's

00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:05,619
bicycle lanes mixed in among the motor

00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:09,369
traffic lanes the awesome Vicky has very

00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:11,849
detailed specifications for this

00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:15,670
it doesn't really suit all conditions

00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:19,180
it's still very motor car centric and

00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:21,400
puts the cycle lane on the side but if

00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,920
there's a cycle lane in between two

00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,440
lanes then it's not very clear how that

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,119
Haga scheme works but it's something we

00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,609
have not really gotten into and it just

00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:34,290
seems really complex and I think that's

00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:34,290
a much larger discussion

00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,370
I have may have an answer to that

00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,980
question regarding the bicycling ends

00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:54,370
there map just like normal mode to

00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:58,440
Colleen's just with additional access

00:49:54,370 --> 00:50:02,260
restriction so your tag also XS : lanes

00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:05,710
for the bicycle gains motorist traffic

00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:08,530
no and bicycling yes and you also take

00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:11,560
the width of the lanes with a : lane

00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:14,380
separator so with current lanes nothing

00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:16,150
nothing and for example 1 for 1 meter

00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,790
for the bicycle lanes and the other you

00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:27,970
live free yeah that sounds like what's

00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:36,220
on the always-same Vicky it did not any

00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:38,650
other questions for Armin there is a lot

00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:41,170
of there is a lot of information on the

00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:43,660
OpenStreetMap wiki on mapping turn lanes

00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:46,690
and you've got you've created a guide

00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:49,330
which is I think very handy to have one

00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:51,640
guide but are there any differences

00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:56,830
between your guys and what's on the

00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:58,690
ozone wiki though it's taking the things

00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:01,690
which are relevant for a mapping project

00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:04,270
and it all links to the ocean Vicky it's

00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,460
all the same information so just an

00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:09,820
extract of the most useful things like a

00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:12,940
handy book like a cheat sheet

00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:14,530
just quickly no or when somebody is

00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,860
doing a project after a long time to

00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:19,450
know remember what the tags were but all

00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:22,150
the detail is still in the overlooking

00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:24,010
but I think the issue was the ocean

00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,570
Vicky is just formatted in such

00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:27,570
different ways in different pages it's

00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:31,410
very hard to find exactly what you want

00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:31,410
when you want to do it very quickly

00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:45,650
just just commenting on the OSM wiki

00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:49,490
compared to your documentation the OSEM

00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:51,380
wiki conflicts with itself a lot so I

00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:54,940
wouldn't take the OSM wiki as the

00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:58,310
definitive truth all the time yeah

00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:00,380
rotate it and make it correct and I've

00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,940
tried to improve the the search on those

00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:04,700
I'm working as best I can

00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:07,490
but it's still used for way too much

00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:10,609
information and if you find old pages

00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:13,369
that are just completely out of date say

00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:15,290
update the wiki to say you know this

00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:17,660
information is not relevant anymore

00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:20,599
because we we collecting so much on

00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:22,730
there it'd be great if people started to

00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:24,440
you know get rid of some of the old

00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:25,280
information that's no longer relevant

00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:30,160
there

00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:32,990
I run the wiki server so delete stuff

00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,089
absolutely it that's very important and

00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:37,700
it's one issue that we face when there's

00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:39,020
conflicting things and when discussions

00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,460
in the mailing list also does not agree

00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,190
completely and there's something on the

00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:45,710
talk page is just slightly different but

00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:47,270
we try to just pick the best thing of

00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:50,210
the Lord see what is the existing

00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:54,170
factors in just you said Ron it's not

00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:55,849
block any 104 delete for-profit things I

00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:58,819
think his comment was it's what a wiki

00:52:55,849 --> 00:53:00,740
like like OpenStreetMap edit it don't be

00:52:58,819 --> 00:53:01,660
too afraid if you if you're being

00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:04,990
sensible

00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,990
next question

00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:13,420
does anybody have a burning question oh

00:53:10,569 --> 00:53:19,460
one more question from christian

00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:22,520
translations feel free like this is all

00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:24,710
open there's no copyright on any of this

00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:28,700
they all this should ideally be on the

00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:31,550
OSM Viki in just a structured way and I

00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:33,980
think from our team side it's so easy to

00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:36,079
work with markdown and just to

00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:39,440
collaborate and then push it out

00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,329
somewhere else but yeah translations it

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,339
needs more help there's no way like a

00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:49,060
small team like ours can maintain all

00:53:43,339 --> 00:53:49,060
