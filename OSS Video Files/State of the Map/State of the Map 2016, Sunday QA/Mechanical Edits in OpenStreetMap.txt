Title: Mechanical Edits in OpenStreetMap
Publication date: 2016-10-20
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Sunday QA
Description: 
	Frederik Ramm at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/staying-on-the-right-side-best-practices-in-editing/
Part 2/3, this follows on from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL4yF-wxI9U and is continued with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wg0P32QhO4

Frederik Ramm will then explain why so-called “mechanical edits” - edits in which a large number of objects are changed without looking at them individually - can be detrimental to OpenStreetMap. He will outline the frequent pitfalls waiting for those who attempt mechanical edits, and explain the correct procedures for performing them.

and now on to critics um I'm going to

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,470
talk a little bit about mechanical edits

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:18,119
or automated edits in OpenStreetMap and

00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,650
mostly the talk is why you shouldn't do

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,260
them or what the problems with them are

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,010
but I will also tell you how to do them

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,689
if you really must do them I might also

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,640
be talking a little bit about imports

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,730
time permitting but the main topic is

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,950
really automatic mechanical edits what

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:39,329
is an automatic or mechanical edit now

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:45,300
most people think when I say automatic

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:47,730
edit we have this we have this system

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,250
with our central database and it's

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,010
accessed through an API and normally you

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,600
have an editor like jasm or the ID

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,030
editor and then you have a human being

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,489
sitting in front of the editor and doing

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,640
something with that and people tend to

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,320
think that this is normal editing and

00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,860
automated editing is if you don't have a

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,409
normal editor but you have a bot robot a

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,150
script a program that and changes

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,790
something in the API and that's why we

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,630
have started using the term mechanical

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,420
edits instead of automated edits because

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,470
what we want to say is you can do such

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,020
mechanical edit even with the editor

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,630
software even as a human being what I

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,670
mean by this is anyone who's ever in my

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:40,320
time at university I I think I copied

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:43,290
maybe 20 30 books at a Xerox machine

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,119
right like this guy in the photo and it

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:50,520
can be a very very mind-numbing thing to

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,049
do to copy a 500 page book and you take

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,659
the book turn the page put it on again

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,689
put push the button take the book turn

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,630
the page put it on again this is a task

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,469
that is being done by a human being and

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,180
not by a robot but it's still kind of

00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:08,729
mechanical and without thinking and

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:13,470
that's basically what we mean when we

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:15,840
say mechanical edits any edit

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,750
in OpenStreetMap that you make without

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,270
looking at the individual thing that you

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:27,570
edit is what we call a mechanical edit

00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:30,930
I'll give you some examples later on

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:34,230
there's there's automated code of

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,570
conduct automated edit code of conduct

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:41,130
in open in the OpenStreetMap wiki that

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:43,980
explains what you should be doing if you

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,980
plan to make such an edit the most

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,240
important thing is discuss your plans

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,890
beforehand because mostly when people

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,200
attempt to automated edit some or

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,080
mechanical edit something goes wrong and

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,300
they and they have unintended

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,380
consequences discussing your plans

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,600
beforehand will at least mitigate those

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,540
unintended consequences because you'll

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,580
have another couple pairs of eyes that

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,140
look at what you're planning to do and

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,510
that may tell you hey are you really

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,390
sure this is a good idea so here's an

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:21,480
example this is Joe some screenshot and

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:28,290
let's imagine that you open your Joe Sam

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:30,330
editor and you find a rectangle here and

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,490
you see there's lots of buildings here

00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:36,180
but this is not colored the same as the

00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,980
other buildings why because it has a tag

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,760
that's called building equals yes and

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,680
building is spelled with a capital B now

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,690
tagging is case-sensitive in

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,120
OpenStreetMap so the editor or the

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:52,170
render will not recognize this rectangle

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,410
as a building so assume that you see

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,330
this and then you check you cross check

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,540
on the iranian imagery and you say up

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:05,430
that's really a building there I'm gonna

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,989
change that to lowercase B and then the

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,870
thing appears as a proper building in

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:13,770
OpenStreetMap and all is fine the next

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:17,070
day you think hey I've run a tag info

00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,900
query and I found out that there are 55

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,710
other objects in OpenStreetMap tacked

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:26,330
with capital B building equals yes why

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,099
not change them all to lowercase B

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,319
certainly it's a good idea I mean the

00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:33,680
with a capital B it's useless it's wrong

00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:37,550
it doesn't work so let me change them

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,560
all and let me help OpenStreetMap if you

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,289
do that without looking at the

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,680
individual things you might create all

00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:48,229
sorts of problems for example imagine

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,900
someone has drawn a building in that in

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:54,110
that place has tacked it with a capital

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,759
B accidentally notice that there was

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,300
something wrong because it didn't appear

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,940
on the map

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,400
later on he drew the same building again

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,520
this time with a lowercase B which is

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,379
the thing that you see beneath it now if

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,870
you make your automated edit without

00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:11,000
looking at that location you will

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,940
basically just create a second building

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,639
that is located on top of the first one

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,069
which is silly if you have been looking

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,629
at the place of course you would have

00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:24,319
discovered oh there are two buildings

00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:27,110
I'll just delete one or there could be

00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,599
something in the middle of a street that

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,210
is tacked with building equals yes in

00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:34,490
the capital B and if you just change

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,289
everything without looking at the things

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,479
then you suddenly have created a

00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:41,599
building in the middle of Road I mean it

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,909
was wrong before but it wasn't at least

00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:45,080
it wasn't a wrong building bang in the

00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,789
middle of her out it was just a

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,639
meaningless rectangle and you have

00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:52,539
changed that into a proper building or

00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:56,629
something that can also happen is

00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:59,089
someone accidentally tags all the nodes

00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:03,080
all than all the edges of the rectangle

00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:05,509
the building equals yes tag and uses a

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,879
capital B and then you change all these

00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:11,000
to lowercase B but that doesn't make it

00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:15,759
any better it was wrong before and it's

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,529
still still wrong after your change so

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,580
you haven't actually helped with your

00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:25,900
edit why do people perform mechanical

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:32,000
edit but it's what what motivates them

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:35,120
it's mostly gardening the wanting to

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,959
have a nice clear lens scape in

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,020
OpenStreetMap

00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,389
without any of the

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,710
automated debugging tools showing any

00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:47,690
errors people want people want to help

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:52,550
people want to do the right thing they

00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:56,650
want to improve the data but unlike a

00:06:52,550 --> 00:07:00,979
real gardener who actually takes his

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:03,800
self individual leaves of dead leaves of

00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:07,490
a plant or something some people

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,190
basically just overdo it by trying to

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,889
fix something planet-wide there's also

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,050
the another kind of motivation that

00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:18,319
sometimes drives people to make

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,789
mechanical edits I mean we many of us

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,770
come from a technical background and

00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:23,870
many of us have been through have had

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,569
this experience where because we knew

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,610
computers because we could write scripts

00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:31,009
we could help other people achieve

00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:34,190
something that they would otherwise have

00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:36,319
taken days to fix right someone's

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,379
basically I don't know someone does some

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,580
some stupid mechanical task because it

00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:42,349
doesn't know how to figure how to

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,419
automate it and we because we are

00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:45,889
computer people we say hey I can simply

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,319
write a script and the other person goes

00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,319
oh my god you've helped me so much thank

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,759
you you saved me days of my life and

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,560
this feeling is something that some

00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,360
people bring to osm and they they see

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,490
something like the building equals yes

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,139
and they say I don't understand why

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,849
people haven't fixed this yet let me

00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:04,610
quickly hack up a script and everyone

00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:07,520
will be thankful then they don't

00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,650
understand the the potential problems

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,039
and implications and then the results

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:15,169
but I only wanted to help yeah well

00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:19,130
thank you but as I said in my subtitle

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:23,029
though the road to hell is is full of

00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,539
good intentions so it's paved with good

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,590
intentions

00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:29,120
it sometimes wanting wanting the good

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:33,050
thing and doing the good thing is not

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,880
the same if you do these kinds of

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,669
worldwide mechanical edits like let me

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,190
change all the capital B buildings then

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,770
among other things the list of your

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,930
change that's if viewed in the API will

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:48,110
look like this and you will have like

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:50,959
tons of really large bounding boxes no

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,509
one will be able to easily see what

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,180
you've been doing and where

00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:59,720
another problem is that that you give a

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:04,800
false impression of an up-to-date map

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:07,470
for example in the US we have many areas

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,230
that have been imported from the tiger

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,689
data source and other people make maps

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,180
of so-called tiger deserts where they

00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:18,360
analyze the map of the United States and

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,240
they color it according to when things

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,399
have last been changed when when has the

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,800
when have there been edits and then if

00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,930
it's if it's kind of red area that means

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,120
okay this this area largely hasn't

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,819
changed since the tiger import so people

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,250
know okay this really needs some mapper

00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:38,279
love and we need to do some updates here

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:41,100
now if someone runs amok with all kinds

00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:44,220
of automated edits fixing stuff fixing

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:47,220
typos changing letters and so on and so

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:50,100
on they will create the impression that

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,139
this area is full of activity right it

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,449
will also it will look green on the map

00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:56,250
like oh there's lots going on certainly

00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:58,019
the map in that area must have a high

00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:01,380
quality because there are lots of edits

00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,209
and if these edits are not really human

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,220
being looking at the aerial image and

00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:08,250
fixing things but someone running a bot

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,279
then it's just a false impression I

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:14,639
caught some flak on the talked us list

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,389
recently when someone said I don't know

00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:20,250
what this branch of this shop is or I

00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:24,720
don't know exactly what it was some

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:27,029
branch of some some chain or some chain

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,769
was changing its name or something and

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:31,110
someone said suggested hey let's

00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:33,990
simply change everything that has name

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:36,149
equals old name of the retail chain to

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,100
name equals new name of the chain

00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:40,980
it can't hurt really it makes the map

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,519
better doesn't it and I said well by

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,529
doing that you actually hide the fact

00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,139
that some areas might actually be in

00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:53,100
dire need of some actual mapper

00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:55,259
attention if if you that's the the best

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,050
user interface that you can have for

00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:01,050
outdated maps if you go to a shop and

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,590
you buy a paper map and the paper map

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:06,370
says

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:08,710
lists some retail chain and has a name

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,300
for the retail chain that you know has

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,610
changed two years ago

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,670
you immediately know okay this map is at

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,500
least two years old and I think it's

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,200
good if the same thing applies towards

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,270
em if there's an area where the retail

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,890
store and still has the name of two

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,470
years ago then I know

00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,150
okay this area is a bit dated there's

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,850
probably not too much people locally who

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:34,000
fix it and I can't rely on this map as

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,070
much as I could rely on a map that has

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,770
the the correct name for the retail

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:41,110
branch so I think it's better if such

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,420
changes are made by human beings who

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,310
will then also do all kinds of other

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,580
fixes and not just change the name of

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:51,760
the retail chain another problem with

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,890
such mechanical edits is that that you

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,390
will often edit things in areas where

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,600
you don't know the culture or the

00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:00,520
language so you might introduce an error

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,680
I mean not maybe not with my building

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,440
example but with other things where

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,770
someone basically someone goes and

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,140
changes all land use equals wood to

00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,820
natural equals wood because he's read on

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,950
the wiki that land use equals wood

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,260
doesn't exist so it must be an error so

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,510
I change it but maybe someone locally

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,050
has actually used that tack because they

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,970
wanted to express something special and

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:28,750
maybe if you do that you suddenly get a

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,760
message in I don't know in Mandarin or

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,350
something from someone who wants to know

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,170
why you made a change in their country

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:40,600
and then you can't even read it or reply

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:44,080
so it's generally I mean it's not ideal

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,510
if you from far away run mechanical

00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:50,920
edits in areas that you don't know and I

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:56,200
have a very small simple example that

00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:59,800
that even provided to me it's not this

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:03,070
is a this is in New Mexico in the US and

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,470
it's a drive-in cinema and it was mapped

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,900
a bit like this so there's there's an

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,499
access road here and it goes in here and

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,799
it snapped

00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:15,909
as a one-way road right one-way street

00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:18,519
and now someone ran an analysis software

00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:20,859
that that was looking for bad one ways

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,049
one-way roads that were leading

00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:25,629
somewhere where you could never get back

00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:28,659
because there was only one way roads

00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:31,149
leading to that place and that person

00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:33,429
found this and said okay obviously this

00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:36,519
must be wrong I'll just remove the

00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:39,749
one-way tag here because you know now if

00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:43,329
the person who edited that had known how

00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:47,679
driving cinemas are often laid out they

00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:50,649
might have had a hunch that when you try

00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:53,589
to drive that road in the other

00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:58,809
direction you will hit something like

00:13:53,589 --> 00:14:01,629
this so yes it was indeed kind of

00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:03,399
mapping error because the roads that

00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:05,109
lead out of the cinema hadn't been

00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,539
mapped but that doesn't mean that you

00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:10,869
can just remove the one-way flag from

00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:13,869
this road so the the proper thing to do

00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:16,989
is obviously just wait for a local

00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:20,649
person to map the cinema in the right

00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:22,539
way and map all the roads and then you

00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:24,549
know how it works and you know how it

00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:28,209
should be so this is this was a

00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:30,099
completely completely manual edit on the

00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:32,289
face of it someone was using the chosen

00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:36,069
editor or whatever editor and removed

00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:38,019
the one-way one-way marker it wasn't

00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:41,019
someone doing that for the whole world

00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:43,599
but it was a mechanical edit in terms of

00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:46,059
you know what I said initially someone

00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:47,919
just removed the thing without thinking

00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,639
like the guy at the copying machine you

00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,829
know that's oh

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,509
one-way error or fix it another one-way

00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:55,239
error other place in the world fix it

00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:59,349
fix it fix it without looking at the

00:14:55,239 --> 00:15:03,669
individual case so the mechanical edits

00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:08,289
will will often turn something that's

00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:11,709
maybe not perfect like a road missing in

00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:12,459
this cinema or like like the building

00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:17,769
arrows that I showed you before

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:21,350
something that's not perfect and but the

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:25,560
deck no sorry I'm

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:29,340
kind of miss speaking here so this is

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,140
about something else the the the cinema

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,500
case is something where you fix

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,990
something just for your tool and your

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,850
one way problem tool will make the

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,590
problem go away or will not show the

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,540
problem anymore afterwards but you

00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,680
haven't actually improved the data what

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,930
I want to say with this slide is

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,730
something slightly different and is

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,820
another topic that we often encounter a

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:54,930
data working group this happens when

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:59,370
someone imports bad data or for example

00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:02,670
we have CEO spammer who adds lots of

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:05,580
locations to places in OpenStreetMap

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,530
that don't really make sense for example

00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,020
we recently had someone add a shop in

00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:12,900
the middle of bang bang in the middle of

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,400
a parking lot and then there was a tag

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,760
that said the keyword that that

00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:21,480
particular SEO spammer always adds

00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,370
keyword tag to his stuff and the keyword

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,470
says something like well this is a

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,340
travel agent or something and then

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:31,290
someone else came along and was alerted

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:38,670
to that keyword tag because it's unusual

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:40,590
and changed that into shop equals travel

00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,500
agent or something like that and removed

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:47,130
the keyword so making it look all right

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,540
from the tagging perspective but still

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,760
not fixing the fact that there was a

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,740
node in the middle of a parking lot so

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,540
that that that's what I wanted to say

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,910
with this slide sometimes there's data

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,670
that's evidently bad because it has tags

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,980
that don't work or something and you can

00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,870
easily find them and then someone comes

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,240
along and runs some kind of mechanical

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,910
or semi mechanical edit and fixes some

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,570
things and that just makes the bad data

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:15,000
less obvious but it's still there if

00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:17,550
people had looked at the individual

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,350
situation with aerial imagery or even

00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,530
better with local knowledge these things

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:25,080
wouldn't have happened now what can you

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,540
do instead what's the right way if you

00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,240
for example find that there are lots of

00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,860
things in osm tag as building equals yes

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,840
with a capital B and you want to get rid

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,019
of them what can you do

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:41,010
first analyze the issue find out how did

00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:43,139
this happen because it could be that

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,419
someone just typed in the key building

00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:46,860
equals yes but you should really try and

00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:49,980
find out is it always the same person

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,350
that does this is it maybe always the

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,179
same editor always the same software

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,250
that creates these problems is there

00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,429
maybe a bug in the software that should

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,889
be fixed analyze the thing find out what

00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:03,809
happens communicate so either bring it

00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:06,720
up on the mailing list or talk to the

00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:08,130
person whom you see or the persons whom

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,500
you see making these mistakes and say

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,230
hey how did this happen what did you do

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,110
here can this be fixed can this be

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,240
avoided in the future then if you find

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,630
that lots of things should be changed

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,000
before thinking about an automated edit

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,190
maybe it's better to run this through a

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,669
kind of a weekly challenge where you say

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,559
hey local community in this week or this

00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:34,679
quarter or this month or something let's

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,870
fix all the branches of this and that

00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,000
supermarket chain and by the way let's

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,580
also do something in the surroundings so

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,299
improve the area or maybe you could run

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,070
it as a map roulette task where people

00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:50,460
will also where people would at least

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:53,789
look at area imagery and fix things

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:57,120
properly instead of just going over it

00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:58,620
with an automated lawnmower then if you

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,409
find that all these things these things

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:04,380
don't work then yes there are rules for

00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:06,870
mechanical edits you can do mechanical

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,909
edits there are guidelines that you

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,039
should be following most importantly

00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:13,409
discuss the thing on the mailing lists

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:18,539
before and make sure that you don't

00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:21,809
break more things than you repair to sum

00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:22,889
up this whole topic the strength of osm

00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:25,529
is

00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:28,230
edits by human beings who have an

00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:30,090
intimate knowledge of the area they're

00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,880
editing in and the subject they're

00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:35,700
editing if you have someone from five

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,990
thousand miles away they will usually

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,820
not do an as good job as editing

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,820
something than someone who knows the

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,769
area

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,049
one who lives there or has at least

00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:50,950
visited there or there making that

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:53,669
concession or someone who at least looks

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,039
at recent aerial imagery and not just

00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:59,889
fixes something to to fix it or to get

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,740
rid of a typo so this is this is what we

00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:05,799
want to encourage you know SM and there

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:09,039
is a place for mechanical edits but that

00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:11,440
place is limited and it's much better to

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,759
involve human beings to fix things even

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,860
if that sounds a bit tedious sometimes

00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:20,139
and I will say a few words about imports

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,379
but really quickly because imports data

00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:27,399
imports share some of the problems that

00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:30,610
mechanical edits have mainly importing

00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:32,440
stuff where without looking at the area

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,710
that you're importing into for example

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:39,789
here this is in California or some

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:42,730
military areas and and some some some

00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:45,009
wetland that has been imported and it

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,370
doesn't coincide with a coastline really

00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:49,659
but it should so it's some something's

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,909
wrong here and I don't know what is

00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:55,299
wrong and the person who ran the import

00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:58,149
should have kind of made sure that stuff

00:20:55,299 --> 00:21:01,750
matches up by by looking at it oh this

00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:03,940
is this is Finland where well forest has

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:07,240
been imported but it doesn't really stop

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,220
there in reality if if people had done

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,980
this manually then then it wouldn't look

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,019
like this it would look differently like

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,269
people may be editing in the areas

00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:18,730
they're interested in this is an old

00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:21,490
screenshot and it's bit unfair of me

00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,409
because it has been fixed meanwhile but

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,960
that was an import in Indonesia where

00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:28,360
someone imported populated areas and

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,090
just imported them all as little gray

00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,220
circles this has meanwhile been fixed by

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:37,149
real human beings looking at aerial

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:42,519
image or even on the ground this is this

00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:46,019
is again in the u.s. city boundaries and

00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:48,970
state boundaries that are somehow not

00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:50,830
really matching up and cross criss

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,700
crossing the river something's wrong

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,560
there

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,600
someone has imported this with

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,940
actually looking at what was already

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,110
there maybe because he felt it was just

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,240
too much work but it doesn't really help

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,680
a lot and it would be nicer if such

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,050
imports could be done by people who

00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,920
actually know the area and can fix these

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:15,510
things properly this is from Aleppo in

00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:18,130
in Syria and it looks alright at first

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:22,270
but if you look at the little little

00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:24,970
triangles those are mountain peaks or at

00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:27,040
least some kind of Peaks you will see

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,670
that I they are all nicely arranged in a

00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:33,700
grid here like it's all rectangles or up

00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:36,310
here all in a line this is this is not

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,310
how it is on the ground this is because

00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:41,920
the data that was imported was rounded

00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:44,500
the coordinates were rounded to I don't

00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,620
know how many decimals but yeah that's

00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,300
if someone had actually known the area

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,010
or at least verified what they were

00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,490
doing the map wouldn't look like this

00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:58,240
and it still does today imports are

00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:00,160
often badly executed by people who just

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,480
feel they don't have the time to do it

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:07,570
properly or don't have the means there

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,600
are good imports or imports that are

00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,700
helpful but you should really only

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,560
perform imports if you are local or at

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,080
least if you are in touch with the local

00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:20,020
community that will then after the

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,500
import work with it and help improve it

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:26,200
with their local knowledge you if you

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,670
work with human beings through say a

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,920
task manager or something where you say

00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:33,330
okay everyone pick an area that they

00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:37,570
know about and import data in that area

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:40,330
if you can't do these things if you feel

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,590
that oh well the country is so large and

00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,870
there are so little people

00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,910
I'd rather import all this data because

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,240
something is better than nothing my

00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:52,390
suggestion would be better better wait

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,640
until there is enough mappers in the

00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:57,670
place who can actually make sure that

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,710
the import is done well thank you very

00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:03,460
much that's what I had to say about

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:06,850
automated edits and imports and I hope I

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:09,130
could encourage a couple of you to think

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:11,950
when next time someone says yeah it's

00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:16,470
easy I'll just change all this in one go

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,470
worldwide with my editor thank you

00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:34,750
one of the things that I found on my

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:37,000
area was that there were non-existent

00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,470
bridges because they weren't there it

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,230
was a road that had gone through and

00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:44,830
turned to what was one road into two

00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:47,320
cul-de-sacs I ended up putting a note on

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,870
a change of the coldest act to say there

00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,580
is no breach here because obviously some

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,679
people were just sort of assuming this

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,980
was silly and keeps putting a bridge

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,440
back in you did say that there are some

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,750
things which is automatically done do

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,190
they check for the likes of notes or is

00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:07,000
there some other thing that we should do

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:10,450
to try and encourage the building of

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,390
bridges which on there it's very

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:17,289
difficult to map the non-existence of

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:19,030
things in autumn and especially if

00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:20,710
you're in the situation where aerial

00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,770
imagery is wrong and people work on

00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,720
outdated aerial imagery like like the

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:28,330
story that Allen mustard was telling in

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,159
his in his opening talk where someone

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,390
else was working from old imagery and

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,100
they were always putting the building

00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,890
back and he was always sort of removing

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:39,030
it or changing it and so on I usually

00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:42,429
place a note there if that happens and

00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,320
if if if I then notice that the other

00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:46,690
person doesn't read the note I'll try to

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,440
message them directly and say I please

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:52,419
be careful with that I have it as well

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,480
where there is a flood barrier which

00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:57,159
looks exactly like a bridge it wasn't

00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,990
for the fact I've been there and seen it

00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,520
like no you can't actually get across it

00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:04,299
yeah thank you

00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,100
it sometimes helps to tack these things

00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:08,500
as for example if there's something you

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,870
see that on the arid imagery that that

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,320
looks like a building but you know it's

00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:17,470
maybe a lake or whatever it really helps

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,330
to tag that as a lake because then

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,960
someone else will see okay well there is

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:24,730
something already and and this is less

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,630
like if you just leave the area empty

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,030
then of course

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,940
someone else will come along and if if

00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:34,770
all else fails what I've something that

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:39,370
I've sometimes done although it's also

00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:43,270
practice notes yep I've sometimes drawn

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:45,460
a rectangle and tack this as note equals

00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,410
there is no building here or something

00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,300
you know just so that's if people call

00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:55,350
up the area in their editor they see

00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:58,300
okay there's something there I wanted to

00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:01,960
maybe challenge you to look forward to a

00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:04,240
part two of this talk next year which

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,390
could focus but I mean these are all

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:11,260
very good examples of problems that

00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:16,240
could happen and you did I think present

00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:20,440
some guidance on what how maybe not a

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,350
mechanical edit but a workflow and it

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,780
designed a process which incorporates

00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:30,520
some analysis at a large scale along

00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:32,890
with human check local knowledge it

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,290
would as well as imports it would be I

00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:38,710
think helpful for people who are looking

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:41,380
at doing this kind of work to see also

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:44,170
examples of where it did work well and

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:47,080
what are the details like design

00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:50,620
principles of those processes that can

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:53,200
help make it work I think we have a lot

00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:56,320
of examples of what not to do but more

00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:01,120
examples of what to do and what to

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:03,310
follow as good practice would be helpful

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,870
for people who want to do that who who

00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:09,040
think that there may be something to do

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:12,520
here with any luck next year I might

00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:15,370
even have an example where I could say

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,830
hey these people did it really well off

00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:20,560
the top of my head I wouldn't be able to

00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,960
name any mechanical edit that that was

00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,060
really good

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,570
but yeah of course

00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,940
as we grow larger especially there are

00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:36,290
situations where for example someone

00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:38,180
Maps a lot of data and has later finds

00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,460
out that they had a systematic mistake

00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:43,070
in in how they were doing something for

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,930
example they were working from offset

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,820
aerial imagery and now they want to

00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:49,010
basically they say okay I've been

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,050
working for five weeks on tracing all

00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:53,240
this stuff and now I find out that my

00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:56,150
air my imagery was offset and I want to

00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,800
basically move everything 20 meters

00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,980
north or something

00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,770
there are use cases like that where

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:06,500
obviously it's okay for this one person

00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:10,400
to just change the stuff that I've

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,620
contributed it's not it's not like you

00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,120
need a second pair of eyes to fix things

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,040
as well so yeah

00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:21,370
there certainly are valid valid cases

00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,370
