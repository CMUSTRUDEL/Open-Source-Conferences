rain if I have to go out in the rain I

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:25,640
tend to try and run everywhere

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,550
occasionally though I've got that warm

00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,010
fuzzy feeling inside I don't have to run

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,210
I can walk slowly in the rain because i

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:37,190
know i have a protective halo these guys

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,320
have been my protective hair later in

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,910
this conference and they've been your

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,210
protective hailer as well during this

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:46,850
conference you might not been aware but

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,380
they've been communicating non-stop

00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,510
throughout we've had an instant

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,030
messaging system set up and they've been

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,250
back and forth communicating ensuring

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,840
that the tracks they synced ensuring

00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:01,630
that things get collected and delivered

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,630
in time and that it all works perfectly

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:15,470
so I lost track of my notes now so yeah

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,020
so you've seen through that instant

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,190
messaging system all the little things I

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,650
would have gone wrong and it might have

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,900
felt quite crazy to you guys and girls

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,850
but speaking to the community and

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,710
speaking to the people they've told me

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,810
how really smoothly it's run and how

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,660
well it's run so I just wanted to thank

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,010
you and say you know keep a memory of

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,540
all the happy moments in the good

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:39,289
moments and look back on it it was a

00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:41,349

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:18,730
some food some of it was vegetarian some

00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:21,250
of it had some fish in it and we had

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,080
some food left over which is kind of

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,510
cool kind of knowing you don't want to

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,750
waste of these guys and I was vaguely

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:31,630
looking at the instant messaging they

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,850
found somewhere to donate that food sir

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:38,110
so our leftover food has gone to be

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:41,230
donated to some social action project so

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,780

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,980
secondly this year I've been kind of

00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,529
relieved by not needing to organize this

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,690
conference but I've put all the stress

00:15:54,529 --> 00:16:02,600
on somebody else and he's still there

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:15,500
restless nights stressful nights out of

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:19,040
those sweat blood and tears to make this

00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:23,420
