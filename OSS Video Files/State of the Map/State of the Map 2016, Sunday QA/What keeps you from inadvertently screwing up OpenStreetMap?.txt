Part 3/3, this follows on from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrvcVAPdaWI

Finally, Simon Poole will review editing tools. He will give an overview of some “shoulds” and “don’ts” that both consumer and developers should consider when choosing a tool and developing one. The talk will be peppered with examples of some of the more arcane stuff you need to deal with to avoid criticism for using or writing a tool that breaks stuff.
