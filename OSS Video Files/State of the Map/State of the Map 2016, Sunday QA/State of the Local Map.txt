d trying to develop their own like

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:10,880
projects and mapping the things which

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,799
are important for them or developing a

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,160
project that they could be profitable

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,660
and so someone being churches some about

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,910
mapping street names in their

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:27,390
surroundings and we are using D choice

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:32,130
them a lot for creating new tasks now

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:39,140
which can be smaller and related to very

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:42,180
small interest cases cute lil Rob hate

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:46,260
say I'm Rob Nickerson from the United

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,940
Kingdom I'm a member of a community in

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,370
the Midlands we call ourselves matt

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,309
baume mercier after one of the historic

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,670
kingdoms in the UK and in terms of

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:59,160
successes I think having a website has

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,370
been really beneficial for us so we're

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,489
an informal community not set up as a

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,659
company or an entity as such but having

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,530
that online portal has meant that

00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:13,170
organisations have felt more comfortable

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,549
dealing with us and in fact they even

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,369
approached us through that online portal

00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:22,799
so it is enabled us to build links with

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,080
some of the local councils local

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:30,450
government authorities some individual

00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:33,240
organizations who share the same values

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,340
as the OpenStreetMap community and of

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,490
course it served as a way that we can

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,920
demonstrate what you can do with open

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,780
street map so we have some some of our

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,189
maps and products on there that we've

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,360
created as a community and to attract

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:51,720
community members and individuals

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:56,070
through the blog posts that we write and

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,460
the meetings that we we arrange

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,189
throughout the year so during the winter

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,259
we'll meet in a location in the centre

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,049
of Birmingham but through the summer

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,090
months we set up a schedule of programs

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,530
where we travel around the wider

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,530
Midlands community

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:19,110
yeah sort of an hour hour and a half out

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,970
of Birmingham in any direction and in

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,260
that way we're able to meet people who

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:27,230
can't always travel in on the evening on

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,360
a week weekday evening into Birmingham

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,790
and we do some Saturday programs as well

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,790
through that period which helps helps

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,890
keep the community going and enable

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,930
people to attend when they wouldn't

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:44,430
necessarily get attend as part of an

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:49,970
evening nita think you'll Rob some good

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,970
and great ideas just where are you from

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,020
first I would like to apologize to

00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,300
Claire because we had an empty chair and

00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,760
we kind of spun a bottle and it pointed

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,500
to Claire so she has absolutely no

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,890
preparation whatsoever sir sorry about

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,900
that also we actually don't have nearly

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,970
enough time to cover this kind of

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,590
subject so I got a lot of really

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,170
interesting responses a lot of people

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,920
who couldn't make it like worst of all

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,630
Mohammed lamine if i'm not mistaken who

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,430
in the end couldn't get a visa by our

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,840
damn government so he couldn't make it

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,360
and he gave some very interesting views

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,270
so I will be writing something

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,670
influential about all this afterwards it

00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,560
was also very very interesting opinions

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,320
for example we're talking now about what

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,530
works and i believe it was Simon Poole

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,410
who said like what worked for us was not

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,470
doing stuff so I'm still waiting for the

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,790
list of things he hasn't done so i

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,640
really want to write an article about

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:57,840
all this very fascinating now what

00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,030
worked for us recently i think the the

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,140
missing maps project has been really

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,660
wonderful to get people to come to

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,510
openstreetmap is completely new people

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:14,330
who otherwise wouldn't at all come to

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:17,310
our activities a lot of women too

00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,010
otherwise there's Claire and Eureka and

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,710
that's the Belgian women kind of

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:26,229
definite I think it's true

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,690
it really helps to organize our

00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:30,580
volunteer force as well so it's but it's

00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:35,349
done more than just attract new new

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:37,360
people and it also really works to work

00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:41,889
together with organizations that have

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,389
their own crazy people like the the

00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,550
people of the slow road who had a

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,169
presentation they have this big

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,080
community of people who are absolutely

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:52,660
nuts about very local paths and they are

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,910
pushing them towards mapping those local

00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,710
parts and openstreetmap and so they are

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,870
already crazy about their subject they

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,389
have a passion as just channeling that

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,310
passion towards openstreetmap and i

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:05,470
really believe that's that's something

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,380
like if you find similar organizations

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,810
which unites crazy people i think we are

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:18,430
very welcome to that kind of craziness

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:21,250
oh yeah anyone want to expand on things

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,819
that work or didn't work in the

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:27,039
community or maybe we can move to

00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:30,280
another question is there something that

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:34,000
we could do on a global scale to have

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,550
new tools or United across all

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,729
communities but that would be beneficial

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:43,389
to every local communities in his own

00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:46,539
place you only want to take on that and

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:48,759
okay okay first on that woman and today

00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:53,500
I I personally feel we're still lacking

00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:55,360
in mobile tools and very simple tools as

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,370
well so we talked about the complexity

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,789
of being able to edit and a lot of work

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,740
has been done on desktop to improve the

00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:05,009
ease of editing open street maps the

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,810
introduction of ID a couple of years ago

00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,520
and a lot of the wonderful tools that

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,750
you've seen over the last couple of days

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,729
make it easy to visualize but for me as

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,889
part of my work I travel around and I

00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:20,860
find myself with a spare half hour here

00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,659
or there in a city I don't know and I'd

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,210
love to be able to go out and map but

00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:28,630
you have a quick look on openstreetmap

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,009
torg and and visually it looks very deep

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,589
and it looks like there's a lot of

00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:34,289
information there and I could spend that

00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:38,610
half an hour trying to

00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:41,789
look how walk to go out a map where as

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,669
if there was something simple we can

00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:48,029
bring up your phone and it says and the

00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:50,399
local community have marked fix meson

00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:52,289
these things or they've compared against

00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,469
government data and they're not quite

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:56,999
sure whether these entities are actually

00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:59,189
out on the street and there's one that's

00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:02,189
200 yards down the road go and go and

00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:04,969
check it quickly do something that's

00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:08,430
very simple to do and you wouldn't need

00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:09,990
to understand how to open it open street

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,819
map it might be something very simple

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,550
just saying yes it's there no it's not

00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:17,240
there and it's sort of like they how

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,860
would you in capture that Pokemon go

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,379
essence and bring that into

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,770
openstreetmap so that we really build a

00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:27,059
very big community of people who can

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,099
interact in a simple way without

00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:32,339
necessarily having to understand the

00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:41,309
complexities of notes ways areas and how

00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:44,419
to link all bits together anyone who

00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:48,839
thinks that we could have better tools

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:51,839
in any area that anyone could use in his

00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,959
own special way locally do you think

00:07:51,839 --> 00:08:01,559
there is some barriers in the existing

00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:03,899
tools of framework in a do SM project we

00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:08,430
we want to aim at local community

00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:11,490
building so I mean they're in in central

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,499
Africa the I mean one of the bear here

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:19,409
we have in the tools is the connectivity

00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:22,199
issue so of tools like possum seems like

00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:25,379
wonderful too i mean fo facing the

00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,869
issues we we are having in in getting

00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:32,159
everyone connected during an event or

00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:33,919
training but there are still like issues

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,269
which really need to be solved like

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,789
identification issues because we need

00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:41,370
people to be able to create new accounts

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,949
we need people to be able to have their

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:47,189
edits being attributed to their account

00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:47,830
and not to another unique import account

00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:50,980
like it

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:55,330
the situation at the moment with person

00:08:50,980 --> 00:09:01,300
so but if it this gets solved it will be

00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:04,110
really a wonderful solution I'm

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,450
definitely tangible product helped a lot

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:10,750
but in any kind so there's of course

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,450
maps me has been great for us as a

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,600
community just as a tool to promote

00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:19,240
possum is really really interesting but

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,300
the main concern I would like to rise

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,640
which I think we have to be better as a

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,010
global community is to Vicki it's really

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,360
like it's very easy to say let's put

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,390
everything in the wiki we can easily

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,640
translate it but the reality is that

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,860
most of the people i got to know that

00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,780
we're interested in OpenStreetMap they

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,250
were they were just turning away when

00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,190
they saw the wiki and how it is

00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:46,180
structured and how it's really not it's

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:48,250
really geektool and we probably have to

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:52,000
difficulty that openstreetmap comes from

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:56,320
communities that are from a generally

00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,400
higher educational level so people are

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,220
more nerdy I would say and then in an

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,200
average um but if you want to be a

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,270
diverse and global community we really

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,310
have to look how we can do better on

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:14,290
getting making this information

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:16,180

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,720
expand the community what they need is

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:59,320
first and foremost training for trainers

00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,170
and bad the basic equipment so that

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,600
train

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:10,399
those can get the end on in we welcome

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:13,880
Guzman thanks for joining us us man can

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,430
you tell us what you where is your local

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:23,180
community and what are your thoughts

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:26,230
about or discussion please thank you so

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,850
I guess in my yesterday presentation I

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:32,300
discussed in detail about how the laws

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:35,170
don't allow a Pakistani mappers to map

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,029
Pakistan anymore because it's kind of

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,440
legal now in a way that you if you are

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:43,310
not registered with the government you

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,260
cannot change the maps if I ignored that

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,470
part I guess the most important thing

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,269
that should work or that needs that that

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,639
that is nearly for the community is that

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,199
we need to understand and make them

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,949
understand what is the importance of

00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:59,690
open data and why is it needed for

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:03,260
everyone and how you take into it so

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:08,690
there's kind of a deficit in the

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:10,579
exposure in terms of understanding that

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,230
these tools are available and how did

00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:17,690
they help in especially in you maintain

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:21,019
in response thank you very much I think

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:26,240
we are running out of time so please

00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:32,079
keep the conversation going oh you want

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:35,149
the closing world used I can't shut up

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,160
just one thing like you need basic

00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:39,649
connectivity first and then the second

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,890
second thing that I think is also very

00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:46,730
basic like just a tool box you can use

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:48,920
to just start for example okay I go to a

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,839
new city I want to know who's active

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,370
there and then you can start look around

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,010
and you have some particle nice and then

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,709
you have you can look at a history and

00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,630
you can you can start working on that

00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,519
and then you with a lot of work you will

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,199
make a list of 100 people who might or

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,540
might not be interested and you have to

00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,940
send them a message one by one this is a

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,410
kind of thing that you really want to

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,600
have like

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,970
just make it easy for people to do stuff

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,680
like that without allowing spamming of

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,600
course I know it's gonna be a challenge

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,500
in this probably why it didn't work and

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,329
there are some basics in the osm torch

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,540
website which are missing to make that

00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:28,759
kind of thing easier and yeah I know I

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:35,360
should do it myself if I want things

00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:38,569
like that but I'm not capable so I thank

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:44,000
you everyone I will take one question

00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:47,269
for the audience apologies to everyone

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,529
for stalling your coffee um I have one

00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:51,170
question which is you've all talked

00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:54,259
about making you're making things easier

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:57,019
for people to find openstreetmap to use

00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:58,790
it to interact a rabbit and yet we what

00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:01,759
I also have heard during this conference

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:04,550
is this idea of the the same why aren't

00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,170
we using IRC why aren't we all craft mat

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:10,160
it was like why aren't we all doing the

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:12,199
brass tacks the actual like down in the

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,630
nitty gritty and I see those is not

00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:17,209
necessarily at odds with each other but

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:19,699
i assume you each run into that tension

00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:21,829
of what is legitimate and what is too

00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:23,990
easy and that's something that a lot of

00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:27,079
communities are talking about right now

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:31,329
not just this one so I wonder if and how

00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,329
each of you has dealt with that tension

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:50,580
I've only noticed that tension on

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:56,220
Twitter well where do we start on that

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:59,040
one yeah so as a organizer estate that

00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,170
stated them up this conference and I've

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,029
received a lot of praise for the things

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,800
that work but you also get the comments

00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:07,380
from people who say oh it's got too much

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,029
to this or too little of that and you

00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,800
know give people a number number 10 and

00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:12,390
you have some people saying oh it's too

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,500
high and some people saying oh it's too

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:18,450
low you can't please everybody I think

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,420
the way you need to approach it you need

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:25,020
to be open and listening to those forts

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,120
and that's why bringing the community

00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,100
together a vent like this is really

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,560
useful because it's it can be

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,050
challenging online just in the text

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,230
formats messages can be misinterpreted

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,570
and misread something which was just

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,900
pointed out of her oh and by the way

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:45,060
comment becomes interpreted to something

00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,400
which is seen as more severe or more

00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,770
problematic so keeping those

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,260
communication channels open and trying

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:55,380
to communicate a meet in person as often

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,420
as possible i think is really useful but

00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:01,470
but don't take it on her and you know

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,790
it's it's a big and wide community it's

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:07,230
going to be impossible to please

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:10,680
everybody at the same time be open be

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:14,300
willing to listen but don't worry too

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,980
much if you there are some comments and

00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,600
they're not personal comments it's it's

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,430
just everybody's passionate about this

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,080
community and about the project and

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,720
they're passionate about their fuse and

00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,279
and those hues are going to be wide and

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,180
ferried and that they're just doing

00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:33,180
what's best for them and what they think

00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,380
is best to the community and and I

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:41,310
passionate about getting that message

00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:44,070
across yeah it's it's just a bit be open

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,750
and and keep the communication channels

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,140
open going as much as possible i think

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,140
is the best

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:58,540
in our community we didn't really feel

00:16:53,230 --> 00:17:04,690
those tensions near um I feel them very

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:06,160
much I I think for us those digital

00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,730
communication tools are gated

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,610
communities either levels of nerdiness

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:16,810
IRC or because their commercial negated

00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:19,420
because like that I think our solution

00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:22,990
if which is not a solution but it works

00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,910
in somehow is to decentralize local

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,620
groups meeting face-to-face personal

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,620
contacts that's definitely the way to go

00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:47,950
can you translate it so that I can see

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:51,460
something I'm sorry I think we will have

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:54,370
to thank our panelists and let them move

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,580
to the next activities the day is full

00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:00,280
of other sessions bird of a feather

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,850
please pick the one you like and thank

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,850
them please

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,650
