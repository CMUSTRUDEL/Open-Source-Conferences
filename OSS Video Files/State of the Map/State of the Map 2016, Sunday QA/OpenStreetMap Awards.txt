okay we're starting I guess not a lot of

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,599

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:17,340
feather sessions and whatever right so

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:21,949

this award we are actually acknowledging

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,620
the stuff they did and well I really

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,420
wished we had more nominations and more

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,820
slots for people so we can just least

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,180
everyone who did anything in the past

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:33,320
year but this is their words so the list

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:38,450
is quite short all right let's start to

00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:43,580
the chase opposite map Awards the voting

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:49,280
started like a month ago and 700 768

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:53,320
people have chosen people and projects

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:58,459
who did who they think did the most for

00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:03,500
the project and now well we're cutting

00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:08,890
to the chase and we'll see who gained

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:14,300
what there are six categories in which

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:17,450
there are five nominees each and well

00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:21,220
we'll see how it goes so the first

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:27,560
category is core systems core services

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:31,880
award or core systems whatever there are

five nominees first is mitesh connection

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:39,620
I think a lot of people on opposite prep

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:43,550
know him he enrolled in google Summer of

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,870
Code last year during which he basically

00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:49,760
changed our full default map style he

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:54,200
painted roles different colors and it

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,239
costs a lot of controversy yeah there

00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,450
was a lot of talk about that and he

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,780
basically made it look more more

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,700
professional a bit better and he

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,190
enrolled in google Summer of Code this

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:12,090
year and also did some improvements like

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:18,120
major labels bigger and edit some icons

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:22,040

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:41,880
proportion yeah it filters by tech

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:44,340
filters by areas whatever he daily

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,190
servers that he does and update the code

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,400

people who work on stuff we use on a

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:33,520
daily basis like openstreetmap website

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:38,920
and so in innovation award is for people

00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:41,170
who make new things who actually go

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,870
around on conferences telling us

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,940
mind-blowing things like there is

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,500
something that is possible now that

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:54,490
wasn't possible before and just for well

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:56,710
new cases of usage of our system and the

00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:00,280
first the mean is a basic is shown that

00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:03,670
it's manual Roth and look at Lucas

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:08,040
Martinelli everyone knows them as people

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,040
who work on osm to the exit I'll stack

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:15,970
the main thing with awesome director

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,810
tiles it is that unlike my box scripts

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,810
they make vector tiles

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:24,140
I'm actually understandable and it's a

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:31,910
very work that will help VeggieTales

00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:34,070
take over and they're making workshop

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,050
today at eleven-forty-five so if you

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:44,600
want to learn more beg you can just

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:46,640
visit then American Red Cross there is a

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,870
lot of some technical things on the

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:55,339
table and it constitutes portable osm

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:58,130
it's basically a seminal box so you take

00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:02,540
it with you somewhere with no internet

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:04,670
and you have awesome website API tile

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,339
renderer basically everything it's just

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,440
a copy of openstreetmap and when you

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:12,110
take it back to internet each

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:17,240
automatically emerges it changes so it's

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:19,160
it's amazing how how it works they have

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,830
already used it in wrote a lot of

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:26,650
articles about it and made presentations

00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:26,650
and they talked about it yesterday

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:37,089
Martin Van Exel is the author of map

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,089
roulette who here has used meprolight

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:45,200
that's quite a lot I guess it's everyone

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,350
in us and soul of people in Europe so

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:54,020
yeah just tool for gamification of

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:55,640
making fixes to awesome data and this

00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,130
March he launched the second version

00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,220
which is more open everyone can

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:07,940
contribute projects to eat and he made

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:11,480
presentation values on Friday map swype

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:14,779
team they're part of missing maps I

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,690
think they made this great application

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:21,350
that doesn't require you to know about

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,029
openstreetmap or spend time placing

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,209
points of interest you just click on

00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,990
imagery and it's

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:31,649
and you bring a great help to missing

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:34,829
maps and other projects it's launched

00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:37,319
just to this July and this month they

00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:39,629
actually published some results under an

00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:44,309
open license so I like that the whole

00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:49,679
application is open yahan Boniface

00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:52,350
benefice maybe he does all things

00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:55,699
JavaScript he is one of lead developers

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:58,499
of leaflet currently busy with releasing

00:12:55,699 --> 00:13:02,850
1.0 so maybe next year we'll actually

00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:05,420
get it he also makes for some chick with

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:09,779
a car to see a theater like tile mule

I'm only knowing it since a year and

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:27,589

great yeah thanks Lucas now on to the

00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:53,220
next inflation influential writing the

00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,610
major part of opposition web community

00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:01,050
is just writing things like blogs like

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:03,209
news and tutorials and documentation so

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:07,230
we need a lot of writing and said the

00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:10,920
very few people actually do that and it

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:16,550
would be very great if more people have

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,550
started while writing all this stuff and

00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:24,630
who does it currently well mainly Kerry

00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,120
Wood he is the most active member of

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:33,750
communications working group some say

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:38,220
he's the only member and he writes since

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:41,070
I don't know 2004 he inspired a lot of

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:45,930
people inspired me to do social events

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:50,270

the most amazing inspirational note

00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,570
about what I like about openstreetmap

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:03,140

already and he writes in his opposite my

00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:09,290
diary a lot about data analysis for same

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:12,530

witches Sabbath that it has a very big

00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:16,740

much for doing your all your week with

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:07,550
osm bc which made it possible that the

00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:10,980
weekly appears in so much languages at

00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:15,180
mostly at the same time only to present

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:21,830

he paid on from the german team thank

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,510
you very much and i hope we can offer

00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:39,210
you more languages in the future

00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:42,000
especially as i said in my speech I

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,390
think we need French I think we need

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,240
other languages as well and with this

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:50,640
tool what Christoph created it is

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,250
possible that you create for your own

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,000
community

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:58,000
a small block every week thanks a lot

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:08,180
Thank You Martha you're the great city i

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,790
have only one certificate you maybe can

00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:19,010
find it up in your free standing office

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:22,790
in Geneva and this book I think you can

00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:38,150
just share well yeah thanks a lot guys

00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:41,810
and keep up the work right the next one

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:43,880
it's about mapping the main thing that

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:47,000
everyone does in opposite map and the

00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,190
first thing I assume everyone just when

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,320
they come to us it nap just before

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:55,400
eating documentation and knowing they

00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:58,880
got it all wrong is mapping and there

00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,740
are few people that do that almost on

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,220
daily basis and do that in a big

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:09,440
quantities and I'd like we would like to

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:14,120
celebrate that hole so who does it first

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:17,980
Los Angeles building importing it was

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:21,380
one of the best impulse I think because

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,890
it was so folks through it's not just

00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,870
building yes with some shady contours

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:31,600
and it's open you can see all the

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,600
process on github so it's pretty great

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:41,450
Martin's dealer I assume not a lot of

00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:46,790
you know about him but on his how did

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:49,220
the same heat map side by Pascal I think

00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:52,070
it's the first time I've seen a heat map

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:56,900
that covers the entire country with no

00:22:52,070 --> 00:23:00,740
holes and it's amazing they say they he

00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:05,030
met one-point-four percent of all hiking

00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:06,980
routes worldwide and

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:11,630
thirty-eight percent of hiking routes

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:13,880
within slovakia now he basically maps

00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:18,280
every time he works anywhere and he

00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,280
walks a lot judging by his facebook

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:28,340
Nelson ad Oliviera loveria you know him

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,920
by his osm username now live and he has

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,860
a very active block in Brazilian

00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:38,540
Portuguese where he mostly assesses data

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:41,750
quality of openstreetmap so here not as

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:45,290
much maps new thing but he helps keep an

00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:49,790
opposite map data in a good quality and

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:51,380
this is also very important yeah and he

00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,770
also does a lot of other things like

00:23:51,380 --> 00:24:01,700
maintains Brazil specific josan

00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:04,040
radiation % a Romani hulia team you

00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:08,600
might have heard their presentations on

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:10,790
a hot cymet some days ago they find in

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,090
train mappers in Dar es Salaam in

00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:19,010
Tanzania that's a very big city 3.5

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:23,180
million and they are active for some

00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:28,760
years and in this time they have got a

00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:31,970
lot of death city actually mapped and

00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:35,270
the United Kingdom quarterly mapping

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:39,200
team they are doing mapping project

00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:42,370
since 2015 you might have noticed if you

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,900
reduce and iOS web project on schools

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,680
which attract sort of mappers and those

00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:50,300
of people who made software for them

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,730
it's mostly brand Brenda Landreau

00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:58,450
bickerson but also quite a lot of

00:24:52,730 --> 00:25:01,820
mappers and a lot of helpers so who won

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:04,100
it was very hard to choose from I think

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:09,740
in this category at one point the wizard

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:17,080
tie like 140 via 214 but we have a

00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:17,080
winner actually and it's Martin's Dylan

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:35,820
Martin is not not with us today but yeah

00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:42,290
here's will yeah he's with us virtually

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:42,290
can you bring him a few things yeah so

00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:52,470
she is very small much smaller than I

00:25:46,110 --> 00:26:04,170
expected yeah thanks Thank say to him

00:25:52,470 --> 00:26:06,120
thanks right okay the next one is

00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,710
explaining the community board the

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,930
community in opposite map they say is

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:14,040
very important even sometimes more

00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:16,110
important than the map so we know

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,470
there's a large community in the Western

00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:21,450
Europe and United States but some people

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:29,730
actually trying to make same truly

00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:31,710
worldwide like these guys as an artist a

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:40,620
little jail cell for becky

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:42,810
buehler i think yeah there they write

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:46,050
very active Facebook group for

00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:48,570
Bangladesh mappers it's in English very

00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,340
seldom in Bengali and you should sign up

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:54,240
because there at about all the important

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:56,720
things in OpenStreetMap they say they're

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,100
active in local mapping mapping

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,200
humanarian team activations abroad and

00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,020
local humanitarian work including

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,140
training NGOs in the use of

00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:10,230
openstreetmap so most of photos in their

00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:16,140
facebook is from trainings and mappings

00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:20,160
very great pascal nice Aaron knows him

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:22,530
he's active since 2010 and people juice

00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:26,580
with fine maps and change the statistics

00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:29,600
since in them and his maps where are the

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:33,270
new sm contributors and who's around me

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,860
instrumental in contacting with new and

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,200
near
