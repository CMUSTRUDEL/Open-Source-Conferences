Title: Station Indoor routing and mapping in practice with OpenStationMap
Publication date: 2016-10-20
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Sunday QA
Description: 
	Roland Olbricht, Roland Wagner and State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/station-indoor-routing-and-mapping-in-practice-with-openstationmap/

The typical public transit station is used by tens of thousands of passengers each day. Due to their complexity a lot of mappers feel overwhelmed with editing stations. Furthermore lots of important features like fare gates do not have an established tagging yet.

The Deutsche Bahn (German railways) with Akaparis GmbH and Dynamo Project and MVV with Mentz GmbH have mapped many long distance and metro stations in the last year. On the other hand there are still a large number of stations which are “terra incognita” for OSM. Therefore this workshop invites you to join these activities and to expand this idea of future smart indoor routing and mapping within stations.

We build on the existing and sound work for indoor mapping (Simple Indoor Mapping Schema) and present additions we suggest to map essential and commonplace features in stations. To further ease mapping we would like to present an approach of defining various levels of details. We also present helpful JOSM presets and a JOSM plugin to simplify tagging. We would like to discuss if these ideas go well with the existing indoor viewers and well-known mapping techniques.

sun-ok you turn it on and it works so

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,880
welcome back from lunch say we got

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,900
Roland and Roland speaking about the

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,570
station indoor reading and and so Roland

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,820
over it I think some people might have

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,350
heard his talk yesterday I've had lots

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,150
of people talking about it was very

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:27,470
exciting I'm Roland Wagoner organizes

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,210
the wear camp in Berlin in November and

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,890
I went last year and I saw them doing

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,070
their station stuff and talking about

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:39,360
that it's very exciting I'm very excited

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,219
about about this talk but um Roland also

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,219
told me at where camp they're gonna have

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,100
something some phones available that can

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,829
access the Galileo GPS satellites the

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,329
first one so good a hand over to pay for

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,739
them but I think Merlin might tell us

00:00:51,329 --> 00:01:03,120
something about that because it's

00:00:52,739 --> 00:01:06,810
exciting over to you goes yeah this was

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,590
an idea maybe journals a bit we galileo

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,799
is sponsoring 40 devices very new

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,240
smartphones which are galileo compatible

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,710
by hardware so if you interested in GPS

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:25,369
if you're interested potentially also in

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:27,540
the deep new Google Android 24 level API

00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:32,520
maybe it's a good idea to come to Berlin

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:37,350
November 3rd 4th so Galileo's pondering

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,479
40 devices and hotter sometimes nice to

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,700
play with on the other hand these are

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,329
also the very first worldwide available

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,990
devices and Galilee will be up and

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:53,369
running and declared as operation noble

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,799
end of October so if you're interested

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,420
also in this gala lyrium you would like

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,310
to have to first despise us which work

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,899
works other small smartphones come

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,429
around there will be also a hackathon

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:10,979
from ISA or Galileo visa and I know and

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,110
thought here are a lot of good nerds

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,810
interested in these GPS things

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,180
so maybe it's worse to announce it it's

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,070
not officially announced it will not be

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,860
really official announced but you can

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:29,240
get a new smartphone and the high level

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:31,230
smartphone ok should we start now

00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:37,490
yeah it's the training you're really

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:41,640
bold and both Rowland's in that yeah I

00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:44,100
think yeah we will share a bit the

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,680
presentation together this activity is

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,410
also some things which are running we

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,290
are running also together which is on

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,860
the one side men's which started with

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,870
activities caught early it's a major

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,810
player in Germany but also now in

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,960
Britain and well alts for a local

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,590
transport operation companies I have

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,920
second role I have also I'm also CIF the

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,830
actor Paris GMB Gabey ha but also I have

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,800
a professorship 4G informatics in Berlin

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:21,150
and I like research and also some

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,740
experiments and this was exactly the

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,110
idea around one outside we would like to

00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,230
give you an overview about the current

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:32,400
state and results but there is also the

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:36,090
possibility for instance to do some live

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,540
mapping and as you know there is a

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:44,850
railway station not far away in Arabic

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:47,520
big big and if there are some interested

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,430
later on for instance to go on the Royal

00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,150
other life mapping and it's not so a

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:59,040
large station we will ask you at the

00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:01,440
very end if we if you like then you can

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:08,400
go with me and or together to the

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:12,450
station for some life mapping ok so what

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,080
are the challenges on one side it's a

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,390
vision that we can how passengers to get

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,859
better around and there is

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,230
digitalization there are more

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,800
possibilities which are there one is of

00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,039
course but

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,009
often just the map where the map is

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,930
something which could be done internally

00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:33,210
but also there were thoughts as it was

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:37,470
in the outside world also to do it

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:40,919
for instance OG with of street map so on

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,590
the one hand side it's still a map but

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:46,710
we are in the indoors and endorses a bit

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,300
different it's not so different but you

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,259
have to have different tools to capture

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:55,440
data for sims for instance you have

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,460
different degrees of details and of

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,360
course we need to be backwards

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:04,409
compatible and also to take the

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,949
discussion how accurate the measurements

00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:10,469
have to be also the device is a very

00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:14,729
accurate it does not mean that we have

00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:17,250
to go also on millimeter where we would

00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:20,039
say and DC meter is something which is

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,569
absolute enough and that fits also in

00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:26,810
our to a chain of the OpenStreetMap

00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:29,250
we saw these things s experiments first

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,500
so there was a time where there were

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,020
lots of discussions is it possible or

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,569
not and that's why we said let's ok

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,330
let's start to met station for instance

00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:42,900
it's based on the simple indoor profile

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:46,620
and that's saw Simon just coming in now

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,460
maybe he left again I'm not so sure but

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,259
we would like to credit him also because

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,029
most of the work is really good based on

00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,009
this and we have some proposal at the

00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:59,279
end where we have maybe some adjustments

00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:01,229
some refinements let's say to do this

00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,139
was something we need to discussion and

00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:05,940
that's also why we're very happy that

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,639
you made the presentation yesterday also

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:11,419
credits to you we will see it fits quite

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,039
good together because of this reason and

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:17,279
this is also a very good idea of this

00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,650
conference to join up so from the

00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,599
introduction but if you it is feasible

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,629
and this is we would like to show you

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:29,729
today and give you many examples how we

00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:32,219
did this and also potentially think

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:33,390
about tools we will need and build or

00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:35,550
adjust

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,670
this is something we are Roland has done

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:44,460
a lot of other things and you will tell

00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:47,730
about but first maybe that so to put the

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,300
long story short what really happened is

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:54,480
a sing very similarly are to the SNCF

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,040
when trying to get this down to the

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,680
passengers who know nothing about

00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,690
OpenStreetMap then it turned out that

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,390
there's some information about the

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:06,240
station that our current taking models

00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,330
cannot convey simple in doors very good

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,020
a point to start but for example

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,080
something we have also mentioned

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,940
yesterday turnstiles are simply not yet

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,460
present so we have to find a tagging for

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,320
this and also all the dirty details

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:27,060
about what we want to know about them

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:29,850
and so this is something we would in a

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,120
new manager of this the distinction

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:36,080
between those who were outside was a GPS

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,780
logger and those who primarily use

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,760
aerial images we would like two kinds

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,680
and nurse that it's a completely

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,740
different approach in the way of your

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,950
starting to mapping because neither the

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:54,630
GPS device North armchair mapping would

00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:57,470
help you and so the basic to change with

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,880
which we started was really walking

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,800
through an understeer is from

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,910
underground station to to get a

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:09,120
measurement and then we was starting an

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:13,350
approach to get better with the laser

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,050
distance measurement unit lingo is

00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:20,870
always disturb as its trademark so we

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,870
have to get you the generic notion and

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:29,250
and so we kind this notion of a cert

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:32,160
generation but we have to find useful

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:34,770
hardware or surveying methods to really

00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,510
get the interesting information but it's

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,120
not what we will talk about that much

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,700
today we would like to present multiple

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,570
examples and then really break down to

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,080
the tagging what's missing and get into

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,440
an integer

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,450
discussion how we can how we can fix

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:57,450
this was pre when what you want to add

00:08:51,450 --> 00:09:06,630
to the tagging huh Thanks okay I think

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:11,760
it's your part again inched it's an

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:13,880
introduction of these devices I was

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,800
surprised that there are even

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:21,720
supermarkets which offer them now for

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:24,750
about thirteen euro so this device is

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,680
about hundred but the difference is it

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:31,860
is a Bluetooth compatible one so we can

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:36,060
line up things maybe in future better

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,860
with smartphones the second idea was

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,380
because you know in general indoor is a

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,380
quite large topic we have a different

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,150
approaches to go for a crowdsourced

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,400
approach which means OpenStreetMap

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:50,070
approach so the one inside the device

00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:54,000
should read not too expensive so

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,890
something below $100 is always the point

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,450
where you can reach a lot of other

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:03,030
people and the second point is also that

00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:06,540
it helps to capture the data very

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:09,630
quickly now and you much less disturbed

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,090
so prior if you would like to do some

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,940
measurements in stations the security or

00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:17,160
the operator will be very quick

00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,780
recognize you or you cannot do many

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,430
things because you had just too many

00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,130
passengers and you have to go and deny

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:26,310
it and at the weekend this is by the way

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:30,810
we just did in Bell in suit choice and

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:32,970
demonstration station from the deutsche

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,960
bahn where we did it with another

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,790
company novice and we did a visual

00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,470
capturing and it took very long so we

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,030
need to have reason eyes you cannot do

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:48,030
it just in between you have to cooperate

00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:49,860
on that but here if I just do beep it

00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,810
doesn't disturb you can go over tracks

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,280
no you should it should not go over

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,790
tracks of course but you can measure

00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:00,660
over tracks very quick

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:03,830
so on the one hand we got a very good

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,660
high-tech device here on the other hand

00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:11,250
sometimes I hear that I'm coming back

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:13,020
very often to PayPal so maybe in future

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,900
there would be new tools and new

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,930
alignments which could be used but more

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,970
or less I think it's also relative

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,460
practical nevertheless of course you

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,700
move the process of digitalization later

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:31,920
into your office we may have a factor of

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:34,920
three or four hours or factor - more or

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,390
less digitalize what you've done well

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,020
one point was also like for instance

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:43,590
heated papers this is a good idea but we

00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:47,120
need much more better or higher zoom

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:52,290
levels so as we know in France I think

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:57,440
19 or 18 Germany I think opens treatment

00:11:52,290 --> 00:12:00,660
or grenda's until API until zoom level

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,470
18 I think from us is one more but never

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,660
20 21 22 because the number of tiles of

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:11,100
course would go up and if you do it for

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:13,200
a specific area you can do it so more or

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:17,570
less we have started very often just

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,580
with regular paper I just mentioned it

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,620
or Vespucci is also butchie's also by

00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,700
the way as very good job if you have to

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,470
put in or correct some numeric

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:31,830
attributes this is something which is

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:36,800
very helpful and also Sebastian who did

00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:41,030
a lot of work at the very end of the

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,800
room here worked quite a lot of with

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:47,640
working presets which can be loaded into

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:57,060
his Pucci which helps also to work to

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:59,370
make better another point is well if

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,230
you're in the outside the privacy

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,120
statement was very often not the problem

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,270
on the street if you coming to the

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,840
inside there might be some points where

00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:12,520
privacy concerns

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:14,440
or security concerns may raise so one we

00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,180
did not know at the beginning you

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,850
started often directly in cooperation

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:23,050
with some of the operators was something

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:26,740
where this would be an option but I

00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:30,580
thought also how to just map incognito

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:33,850
so without asking the Spanish Railway if

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,130
she likes to have you or not and one of

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,990
the experience was now that's why also a

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,710
reason was if they capture me into

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:45,700
prison then I I think I will make it out

00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:48,040
but the result was after doing a lot of

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,880
stations now that because of this

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:55,000
devices and you don't disturb very often

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,760
it not not being recognized at all for

00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,700
instance and Washington or New York you

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,840
know every person was a security guy

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:08,710
though there are lots of cameras around

00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,450
and it was hours in the station nobody

00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,310
asked

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,320
so in Chicago wasn't very first time

00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,840
somebody came around and saw them where

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,830
they come to me but I worked really also

00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:23,380
very obviously and I moved away but they

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,150
coming to you okay and they wanted to

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,660
ask what you're doing and about bombs

00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:32,170
and whatever I explained what we do it's

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:35,620
a OpenStreetMap it's an open map and who

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:39,040
I am and then somebody else just Colton

00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,800
and they went away so I very good

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,990
experience on this don't map together

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,600
the two people because then you will be

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,040
discovered and if you do things like

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,570
that

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,940
peep-peep it's much better just as a

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,220
short intermission in terms of what's

00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,140
what means in cooperation with the

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,000
operators when you are talking about

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,970
public transport operators these are

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,600
very often very large organizations I

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:11,140
sing drum rails run into six ticket

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:15,220
figure of employees so that's the size

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:18,160
and in practice corporation meant I took

00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,830
a high-visibility jacket I took a pile

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,590
of my own business cards I noted the

00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,950
phone number

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:26,480
the name of an transport company Emperor

00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,130
years Addison what is informed about

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,350
this on the backsides of my business

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,850
cards and whenever somebody asked me

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,320
what I'm doing was his high visibility

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,920
checked I just handed him over the

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,560
business card and explained it's it's

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,300
with permission and for your own company

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,100
and that's a guy you can ask for and

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,370
actually it works I think people are

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,620
smart enough that there won't be

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:56,870
tourists walking around that way so you

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:59,510
can get offices pretty reliably by

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:02,270
yourself and you may have also some

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,940
luggage sometimes if you want to measure

00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:07,100
a distance which is in this case I would

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:12,920
like to measure how far rollin is away

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:14,780
ah 10 meters 12 centimeters but the

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,410
problem is sometimes if I would like to

00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:24,680
measure the length of this desk

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:26,390
I have no target if I you take the

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,020
target there's one idea at the beginning

00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:33,200
I just called the mullah because the

00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:37,460
idea was also from a colleague just a

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:42,520
device and this is something we had a

00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:45,290
box from just by accident the box from

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,760
from a smart phone and a small box I

00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,530
thought it's a good idea you can lay it

00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,280
down you can capture it you can walk

00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:54,950
away but this little box turned so much

00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:58,640
intention of passengers that it was not

00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:00,440
a good idea so another idea is really

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,090
something like that if you have your own

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,510
luggage for instance you would like to

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:08,540
measure how far this wall is and you

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,940
need something as a target sometimes I

00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,800
use just luggage this was very very

00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,750
practical of course you should not go

00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:20,770
too far away because then you got the

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:23,770
bomb belong but this worked very very

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,770
good

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:34,120
absolutely essential to will and Joe

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,360
semester pluck in building tool it's

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:41,170
from a user up liner in Moscow it would

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,870
like ready to give credit to so this

00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:46,750
brings in the meter measurement into

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,820
chosen on the one hand side is really

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:52,420
important it's the yellow one that you

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,280
have meters measurements inside and not

00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:59,070
just coordinates and the second its it's

00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:02,820
just makes square good square and easy

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:05,470
geometries and this is also a point

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,810
where there might be also some other

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:11,140
refinements but this is an absolutely

00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,880
essential tool you know must install to

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:18,070
being able to work with meters because

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:25,420
in the indoors meters are the unit and

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:28,540
not coordinates but there are also other

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:31,120
ideas which are needed yeah the idea of

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,250
this plugin it's not corny operational

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,190
because it was paralyzed by the update

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,890
to Java 8 I try to fix this in the next

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,290
week's but what's more works and

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:47,350
expected and the idea is to terrorize

00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:50,680
the getting the shapes of of let's

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:53,590
assume this this stage here is a

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:57,340
platform and you try to get this stage

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:58,990
into in terms treatment the problem is

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:03,040
you don't have an aerial image so you

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:05,200
can can't just write down it so you have

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,970
to get the data some in some other way

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,310
and there's a world if you simple way

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,320
was walking and it's afterwards it's

00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,120
easier was a gesture but I will to

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,240
demonstrate it was walking how it is

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,560
intended to be finally get to finally

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,560
get it into OpenStreetMap

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:53,050
now I can turn on this again without

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:58,780
interferences town again three four five

00:19:53,050 --> 00:20:04,870
six and the end I don't have much more

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:07,330
than two three four five and I don't

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:10,810
have much more than six or seven numbers

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:13,720
but these numbers are complete to

00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:17,410
represent the exact shape of the stage

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,900
or platform uhreally literally was in

00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:23,200
minutes you are through it sounds

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,960
completely weird unless you start for

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,060
the first time to make sense of a quite

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,900
complex career George really to get the

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:34,120
form without super tools and then it's

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:38,020
quite surprising this is the best way to

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:41,590
to get this or some feasible way in this

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:43,930
way I were able to get the standard bed

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:47,890
place standard underground station was

00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:50,610
in an hour or so really the time to walk

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:54,160
around the platform and count my steps

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,510
class the time afterwards to put the

00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,470
figures into this plugin

00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:01,510
the plugin would send generate or yes

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:07,840
the plugin which and then generate a

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:09,430
form like this ah I have a pointer will

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,580
then generate these these quite

00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:16,720
complicated forms for you from the count

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:18,880
and it's a stunningly accurate you got

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,320
afterwards precise positions of the

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:26,110
tracks from the local operator and the

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,530
platform simply fit even from walking in

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:31,870
from walking on the this just steps and

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:34,420
you can imagine when you have a disco

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,310
it's even a little bit faster and you

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,400
really get this problem solve and that's

00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:41,450
what's a plugin about but I'm sorry it's

00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,250
just not operational was he up there

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,440
of chosen to Java eight when you have an

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:48,350
old version of Jotham around before the

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,850
Java 8 update you can right out of the

00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,180
box otherwise you have to wait some

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,550
vague weeks until the plugin is

00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:58,910
operational again

00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:02,150
there is room for new ideas so like

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:05,180
counting steps is extreme efficient much

00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:08,960
better than taking that beep because

00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:12,050
very often you know that the ceilings

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,900
are do not correspond exactly to the

00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,130
levels where if you're going into entire

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,590
stairwell

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,540
you've got very good numbers and very

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:24,470
standardized numbers just because of the

00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,090
steps of very standardized this is an

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,870
important message it's really much

00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:31,520
faster than you expect sometimes also

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,940
another thing is like if you have very

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,950
long distances like platforms these

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,470
devices are not so good because

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,980
sometimes they cannot simply reach it or

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:45,950
there is something where you have like

00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,900
tiles and if you know the size of one

00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:53,050
tile you can of course very quickly

00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:56,290
count also so alternative ideas are also

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,290
important things

00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:08,170
okay so the idea is that you have

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,680
different record it's levels of detail

00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:16,780
the problem is there are some 5,000 to

00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:19,600
airway stations in Germany alone and so

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,200
if you would just spend an hour on each

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,050
of them

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,970
you are busy for three years you can't

00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:27,310
send out large schemes but then you have

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:30,940
to educate the teams and it wouldn't be

00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:32,980
much faster again so that year is to

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,450
getting things done

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:40,710
you start with lower expectations just

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:43,870
formulate sorry you just formulate

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:46,060
what's really essential to achieve at

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:50,080
least power of this for example the

00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:52,240
simples achievement here is while we can

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,100
get out the position of the station from

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,030
the geo coder that's already much better

00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:01,540
then Jen if you have no clue where the

00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:03,610
station actually is this is much more -

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,110
when you look on a map this looks like

00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,610
the station and people who are familiar

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,510
with the station would start to

00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:13,360
recognize this and this gets closer to

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:16,330
you can start to really do routing for

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:21,160
passengers in the stations or gives them

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:23,350
a plan of how the station looks and but

00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,240
it turns out routing of pair of

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,520
pedestrians is a very delicate thing

00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:32,200
because things are not very standardized

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:35,440
so you have to really solve the problem

00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,470
you would have to repose three signposts

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,630
entire station to just develop an idea

00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,870
how passenger flow is intended to be

00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,910
from the architecture and then put the

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:49,210
signposts where they belong and in

00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:51,880
reality you cannot just push mess around

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,370
signpost so in the end you have that's

00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:58,960
the whole point about level of TTL fear

00:24:54,370 --> 00:25:01,600
for is to make sense of the existing

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,660
signposts and to base a passenger on a

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,350
VJ navigation passenger routing on G

00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,460
sign

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:12,580
and this is very much work we are

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:15,789
talking here in the range of a day or

00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:19,649
more for large railway stations well

00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:22,659
this is in particular one and two are

00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:25,299
two most interesting tours it's a range

00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:27,639
of you just set in a stopped train and

00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:32,220
look out of the window to get most of

00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:34,480
the things already fixed and now we'll

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,880
sift through the details of the inner

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,179
layer level of details and what it's

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,970
about

00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:41,110
yes zero is about you can retrieve the

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:45,539
location from the

00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:48,129
geocoded it's already much help because

00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:50,250
it could point people to the right

00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:52,750
direction or even if your outing is not

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,990
perfect you could at least do some

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:59,529
peasant routing - from the supposed

00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:01,840
entrance to the to the home address or

00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:07,029
to the target address of the passenger

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:09,190
of the pedestrians and we are quite

00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:11,289
complete verses in Germany I think there

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:14,139
are twenty or thirty statements left and

00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:17,559
most of them are artifacts from the

00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:21,840
German we're based database so it's

00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:24,580
probably assured that this really works

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,700
this is something that's not yet

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,559
complete but it's some things that

00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,480
should be fixable relatively easy

00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:33,100
because it's about error images so you

00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:38,070
don't have to get out of civil out of

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:42,039
your office you could really do this

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:44,710
second generation armchair mapping to

00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:50,679
get this done so it's also relatively

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:54,909
cheap and the benefit is you get you get

00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:59,590
a nicely looking map because a map looks

00:26:54,909 --> 00:27:02,980
lies if it covers to tea and was

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:07,090
reasonable information and it's exactly

00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:08,860
what an aerial image does it's not as it

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:14,230
hasn't much to do with the truth but

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:15,789
really it delivers nice maps and now

00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,920
it's back to you so it was funny

00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:19,870
yesterday of the presentation

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:24,250
which was very good and of course I was

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:26,110
sitting somewhere in the audience and

00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,990
something looked maybe it was from Italy

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:33,220
maybe from her own ah-oh

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:37,390
thus Rome look like so this is a very

00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:39,940
typical situation for the difference now

00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:42,820
between level let's say zero and once

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:48,100
done existence very clear all the aerial

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:53,860
pictures done and then you have a bowie

00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:58,330
books maybe a McDonald and Naik store a

00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:00,390
train ticket shop and this is a very

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:03,490
typical situation where a lot of

00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:07,470
stations are in this mode currently so

00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:10,180
this is a good example what can be done

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:13,360
also some would could not be done if you

00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:16,090
don't go really in the inside or having

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,570
a look at least from the train station

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:22,920
or from the train they very often things

00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:26,320
are under the roof very simple like

00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:31,270
elevators you cannot grasp from the

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:34,060
aerial point and let's just roam it's

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:36,820
the same by the way to edit back very

00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,880
typical thing as so as we mentioned so

00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,040
very often the building is there quite

00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,660
good by the way

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,670
the platform is there there is some

00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:49,840
routing very often their entrance may be

00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:55,000
but then there is not so much it may can

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:58,270
say a little station not so much there

00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,330
but again if you go to the station there

00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:02,890
there are sometimes a lot of more things

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:06,550
it can be used but you need to have

00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:12,880
that's a indoor geometry to better

00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:14,740
organize it not just as a boy so the

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:20,860
general message now this is one of the

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:25,320
key message now move from toys or simple

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,320
ways up to areas

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:33,930
so if you do if you see like an indoor

00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:38,460
map also a classical one areas are the

00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:41,480
more important basic feature so for

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:45,990
instance if you start with us with a

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,900
width of stairs yeah it's good it's a

00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:51,420
way as a starting point or if you have

00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:55,470
an elevator as good as a starting point

00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,690
but if you see sometimes that stair us

00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:00,780
especially in railway stations are quite

00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:04,650
large it's also important for

00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:08,540
consistency to understand the dimension

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:13,010
of this also one of the experiences that

00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:16,140
stairs are underestimated and

00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:21,770
OpenStreetMap so they are much longer as

00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:26,100
they usually would quickly draw them in

00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:29,030
on the other hand what wouldn't just

00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:31,590
mentioned about backwards capability

00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:35,070
there are some good reasons to leave

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:37,920
especially we will explain later on some

00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:42,330
of the more primitive elements like

00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:46,770
nodes and ways but bringing the areas in

00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:48,900
a higher degree of level so we have

00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:52,110
backwards compatibility of them well in

00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:55,140
service which is quite good but we have

00:30:52,110 --> 00:31:02,430
also the ability to create good-looking

00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:04,710
maps because their areas are needed just

00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:07,140
to make one thing clear we've caused I

00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:10,800
see some people confused which are just

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:14,310
to ask for that two different

00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:17,640
OpenStreetMap elements at least in a

00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:20,130
couple of situations there are some

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,810
cases where the way gives all the

00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,780
information that you need to if you have

00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:27,270
a stair for example oh it's even these

00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,040
are rather complex examples if you ever

00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:31,140
stared at this as a rectangular shape

00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,360
and all the information you need is the

00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,880
number of steps and there will because

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,590
the world is all over the

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,380
all of us the steps the worth is the

00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:42,950
same then it would be fine with the way

00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:45,440
but in practice a lot of stairs if you

00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:48,650
would just look about the stairs and the

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,470
galleys there is no constant with this

00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,450
thing starts with the words of about two

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:57,050
meters and there are somewhere here it's

00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,820
about four meter wide I mean that that's

00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:01,850
a precision that we could could in

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,890
principle still without but in a station

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:07,850
you could easily find something a step

00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:11,150
that service is one one meter long or

00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:14,510
two meters long but it is 80 meters wide

00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,310
or so for example pari sao paulo where

00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:19,850
an example is an example where you have

00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:20,930
a very broad steps but in main station

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,710
is also an example where you have very

00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:27,850
broad steps in a very irregular form and

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:35,150
in that case you would suggest to have a

00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:38,060
way to show in which directions the the

00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:40,700
slope runs so that you know where well

00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:43,400
sit down side and rest outside and to

00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,500
have an area that covers the actual area

00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,290
the stairs cover just to give you an

00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:52,370
idea where the state's really resisted

00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:54,800
us really are so that's the idea of

00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:57,830
having two elements to represent the

00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,170
stairs because there's information that

00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,760
you can't get in a single in a single

00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,650
element you want to know in which

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,320
directions the slope of the stairs are

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:08,720
what way the stairs are oriented and you

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,820
would also like to get the precise shape

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,000
of the stair so it's why we would

00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,770
suggest to have two elements one giving

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:24,200
the slope information one giving the

00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:26,390
shape of the stairs so there are more

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,750
detailed things as I said this areas

00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:32,390
topology nodes we do not have a big

00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:35,120
problem on semantics by the way in

00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:37,900
general like shop like a bakery or all

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,640
texts which are already available in OSM

00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:44,560
but the geometry is something which is

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:47,180
very often a bit missing and the thought

00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,820
other typical things are especially

00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:52,080
about these

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:53,639
and escalators and elevators and ramps

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,789
this is something where the current

00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:59,940
situation was not so good so we need to

00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:02,580
extend it what Simon Poole also did with

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,479
us in dorm rooms or in the profile was

00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,799
very good very reliable it could be very

00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:12,299
industrial-strength we can really used

00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:15,240
it and there may be just some parts to

00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:18,720
be added but just a little thing then

00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:22,230
some rate weight specific things like we

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,859
do have some let's say for long distance

00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:29,069
trains which are quite long we have some

00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:32,940
parts or signs to indicate where your

00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:36,599
carriage your seat should arrive which

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:39,030
is very bun very perfectly done in Japan

00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,220
I mean if a colleague also from Tokyo as

00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:46,109
you go they are you see how it could be

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:48,780
done perfect we have some points like

00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:50,639
service centres travel centers potential

00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:54,780
loggers rules which are a bit specific

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:57,770
for railways also yeah this is an

00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:01,920
example from the Berlin Hauptbahnhof

00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:04,260
burn in Central Station what was also

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,480
something with the operators we're doing

00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,520
it also together with the operators is a

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,579
bit expecting and this which is very

00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,470
running that the oh jeez the ops

00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:15,240
treatment community also updates this

00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:19,109
and this was a bit funny with the media

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:22,440
markt there's a large electronic market

00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:27,450
and it was really interesting how fast

00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:29,579
OS a mapper updated that but also it is

00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:34,849
interesting that a lot of osm colleagues

00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:39,089
have some fear about the indoor geometry

00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:43,520
so their geometry it's a bit more

00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:46,829
difficult where a change of the name

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:50,190
it's very quick done so this really

00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:51,839
worked out and it's also wanted and

00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,000
desired by the operators because

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:58,880
otherwise they are also by their self

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,880
problems to be up-to-date old problem

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:07,060
level of detail for ya I won't say too

00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,780
much about this this is what I mentioned

00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:12,010
they are dearest really pedestrian

00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:15,310
routing to the extent that you really

00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:18,400
can give pedestrian directions and

00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:21,190
giving directions so pedestrians you

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,980
can't in a useful way tell a pedestrian

00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:26,560
to walk twelve point three meters and

00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,720
then turn by eighty degrees it's not

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,359
possible because you have neither a

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,240
distance measurement built-in nor do you

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,930
have an ancient measurement in built in

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,030
so you have to tell them things like get

00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:43,000
in this direction get in that direction

00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:45,940
and that turns out that you will tell

00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,210
the people it's a sign the signs in our

00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:51,790
in the station so you want to get into

00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:58,270
OpenStreetMap the signposts of the

00:36:51,790 --> 00:37:02,020
station so really information like get

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:04,420
off to the Austin means exit get off to

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,700
the exits verboten Strasse or get out

00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,770
off to the exit is a tour and for this

00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:12,069
you really need to know that these

00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:15,369
literal strings are there and that is

00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:19,990
something that's also new and not yet

00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:22,060
stable and OpenStreetMap to to capture

00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,589
these signs in a useful way you have to

00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:27,310
capture from which direction you can see

00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:29,380
the sign and also by which direction you

00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:34,329
want to send the people and in which

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:37,329
situation to sign applies plus some

00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:39,730
solution for these informations it's not

00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:41,950
really these are not really strings if

00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,930
you cannot simply convert them to

00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:46,690
Springs so you have to find some

00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:51,670
solution how to encode these more or

00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:53,349
less standardized icons so the

00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:56,920
corresponds was my time this morning

00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:58,780
said about the freeway signs and if you

00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,520
use the navigation system where you see

00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,240
the Sun coming and you see it also on

00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,440
board it's very good for humans to

00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,430
understand where you are and if you're

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,560
on the right track

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:10,390
on the other end we did that diploma

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,030
thesis a set and also a professor also

00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,940
the

00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,860
we had diploma thesis from Yuya a flower

00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:19,210
is by the way also running the Geo

00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:23,900
Mondays in Berlin this would mean that

00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:26,530
you the detail level or also the afford

00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,920
we'll just mentioned or really goes up

00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:33,350
on the event I see a clear value also

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,020
but it's maybe a bit too early now or

00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:41,030
for really some very very already good

00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:44,800
map stations or the indoors to go so

00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:51,080
again an example this was Amsterdam

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:55,520
prior we started and it looks like it is

00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:57,890
today the number of features we grew up

00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,870
and one thing I'd like to mention here

00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:05,630
or about peanuts pillars something we

00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:09,050
may as a regular pedestrian even not so

00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,850
interested to see the pillars but an a

00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:13,970
very important thing to share for

00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:18,560
capturers is that pillars define very

00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:22,700
strongly the building this is young

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,890
Marsh here yesterday after the brewery

00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:28,670
you we went to downtown enter this

00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:30,800
market war and I said if I would make it

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:32,930
I'll just beep one distance from one

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,200
pillar to another one and I'll quit

00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:40,130
simply count I would be very quick and

00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:45,530
getting a relative exact data about the

00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:49,100
building and also about other structures

00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:52,190
like roofs on top so the one inside the

00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:55,640
pillars got in the capturing more and

00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:59,270
more important at the beginning I really

00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,920
just ignored them currently I'm really

00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,600
looking at for the pillars because they

00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,400
define the building very good and this

00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,370
also very important if you have to clean

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,280
up large areas or stations like the

00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:12,380
Berlin Hauptbahnhof was in a situation I

00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,270
don't know if you know the burden help

00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:17,030
on off its a crossing barn of a crossing

00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:21,640
stationed with many levels quite nice

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:26,170
but relative complex and I think

00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:28,539
a long time no oh s M Mehta went into it

00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:30,630
anymore because it was so complex and

00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:34,329
nobody wanted to touch it again

00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:39,400
so really to clean off a building and to

00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:41,589
line up the ways it's very good to have

00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,839
something like this pillar grit and it's

00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:48,400
very often by the way a grid like the

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:51,549
barn of in how panel in Berlin we need

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:55,420
to clean up this current situation and

00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:57,849
that's once now if you would like to

00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,609
visualize them you may discuss if you

00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:04,240
would like to visualize the pillars for

00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:05,349
instance see them below or not you can

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,480
of course you can order in a

00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:11,319
visualization it's not so important but

00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,910
it's very good for data consistency and

00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:18,670
here you see by the way also the two

00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:24,880
levels from Amsterdam rendered currently

00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:27,250
with a DB style now there are more

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,710
examples and because Munchen is the

00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:35,859
headquarters of men's I think this the

00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:40,000
best mapped station is mentioned many

00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:43,539
levels but also good Maps nevertheless

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,579
we will see later on police test but you

00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:48,099
have done also go interesting Birmingham

00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:50,940
is another thing we have a colleague

00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:50,940
Brian

00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:56,109
he did it quite early in fact prior we

00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,630
started but this is interesting to see

00:41:56,109 --> 00:42:02,380
you in the modern side this shift at

00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:05,470
that time it was much more concentrated

00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:08,200
like a bit like this poi idea on top of

00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:11,710
something where there are no corridors

00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,190
or in you see the corridors are missing

00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:17,349
and this was at the beginning a part

00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:20,829
where we just neglected also he

00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:25,539
neglected the corridors also some will

00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:26,759
already defined it and corridors are

00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:30,309
really important

00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:33,680
this is Rena station and we did it with

00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:35,960
she Hoshi colleague from Europe

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,760
Blake what you see also here in the

00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,849
corridors are something about the access

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,030
rights you know we need to talk about it

00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:46,099
a bit about especially in France like an

00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:48,520
oyster card in London or so there are

00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:51,680
some parts of the stations which are

00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:54,470
public more or less and then you get the

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,109
ticket barrier and bandar need to have a

00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:59,690
ticket to be inside and these are things

00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:01,760
we need to refine also because it's a

00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,290
big difference if you for instance go to

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,040
the airport and you want to know where

00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:08,059
some $1.00 this is prior security behind

00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:11,839
these are things which are quite

00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:15,530
relevant a city station there's another

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:20,599
example very well organised public

00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:22,869
transport system I spend much more time

00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:29,420
than expected

00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:31,280
Proc also quite nice still a lot of work

00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,900
to be done in underneath to the

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,059
underground because I don't want to buy

00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:38,809
an underground ticket that's why I just

00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:41,710
left on the public part possessed as we

00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:45,530
have seen yesterday and this is a

00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:47,960
screenshot from the data you have

00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:50,000
produced so much credit of the one

00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,010
inside to produce this on the other hand

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,040
we did not know each other prizes

00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,690
conference so there was Benoit a few

00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,190
weeks ago he said hi you should link up

00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:04,849
and so I went with our way of generic

00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:07,339
page client on it and voila I said wow

00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:10,339
they have done that a lot this most

00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:13,730
impressive I've seen so I think this is

00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:17,359
a standard test but it's not just police

00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:22,220
test is also not one per year or was it

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:25,160
five station Los Angeles for a long time

00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,660
Los Angeles mmm not much traffic but

00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,680
they built in last ten years so much

00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:31,910
local traffic I was absolute surprised

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,319
what a brick is also a bit interesting

00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:37,819
because it's also a nice station on this

00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:41,420
suite quoits is the experimental one

00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:43,640
where we start also Janowicz Buca is the

00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:45,620
center of the DA Japan they're having a

00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:49,670
startup

00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:51,920
incubator there Pollino span of also

00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:53,780
something reason this was very

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,450
interesting because we had a little

00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:58,430
discussion where which as there was

00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:01,610
really nice it's also very good to

00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:03,470
mention now because they have done a lot

00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:05,780
of work and was one of the basic ideas

00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:08,300
was release this starting point taking

00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,640
over a layer map and even to extent it

00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:12,740
on the other hand we realized a bit

00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,040
that's a bit different where passengers

00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,600
go like in the indoors to the stations

00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,540
or where trains go

00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,760
so signaling other things so a good

00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:26,840
border and a positive sense are very

00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,670
often two platforms so from a passenger

00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,040
point of view you're not so much

00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,420
interested in the switch but from

00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,800
infrastructure point of view if there's

00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:37,610
a switch or not it can make it to a

00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:40,340
different track so they have done really

00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:44,090
a lot and much credits to me helm which

00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:46,130
really did much much more work and also

00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:51,620
a lot of good ideas like the tight

00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:54,230
service we learnt a lot yeah to make

00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:56,900
things a bit easier now for you we

00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:58,670
introduced also preset so some of the

00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,970
parts being taken from open railway map

00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:04,790
some of the parts from our regular one

00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:07,160
some features are bit knew everything

00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:10,580
about stairs is an issue we go more into

00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,040
detail later on than some railway

00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:14,450
specific things are inside which are of

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,080
course new but more or less is a

00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:20,060
combination of existing ones and you can

00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,730
find them on the one hand side through

00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:26,360
this URL or you can find them also with

00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:27,920
in OpenStreetMap and thanks again for

00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:31,000
giving me the hint how to bring the

00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,000
preset into chosen

00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:44,520
this is a point we tried to turn to

00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:49,890
invent as few as possible and to keep

00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:51,660
things as much as possible and this the

00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:55,080
difficult point is we are really about

00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:57,900
mapping stations it's just because it's

00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:59,790
probably the most important case of

00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,520
indoor mapping because most people get

00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:04,950
through one or several stations whether

00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,190
in office buildings or so people only

00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:09,930
get with this particular destination and

00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:12,740
we found the information was scattered

00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:16,620
around a lot of different schemes and

00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:19,800
none of these taking schemes covered all

00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,990
we wanted the French one is even one we

00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,380
haven't found yet but we have noticed a

00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:27,720
URL on our incorporators here and the

00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:31,560
idea was to pre-exists down into a short

00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:33,930
list of tags that would really solve the

00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:38,100
practical problems of station mapping

00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:40,470
and so we try to stay take over from the

00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:46,410
different taking schemes as much as

00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:49,440
possible the generalization where we

00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:51,120
come to is this is a very important

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,490
distinction in general it's very

00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:56,370
important we have seen the corridors and

00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:58,260
math in a lot of stations and it makes

00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:00,690
it's really difficult if there's nothing

00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,220
to represent the corridor it's even hard

00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:05,100
when you have a way to represent a

00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:08,040
corridor because there there are more

00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:10,710
ways that are useful within typical kora

00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:14,670
doesn't you might expect from practice

00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:17,100
we had mapped underground station in

00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:19,470
düsseldorf in Germany was only way since

00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:22,200
the beginning and then you get very Pisa

00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:24,810
west when people just should get from

00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:28,010
the elevator to the stairs to get

00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:30,690
outwards you really sent it across these

00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:32,550
this area with the ways cheaply because

00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:35,310
you have forgotten it were to add a way

00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,990
there so you really want to corridors as

00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,660
an area

00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:40,520
where you can navigate over and that

00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:43,580
it's by its importance of sakura de as

00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,050
an area and you were very easily come to

00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:48,170
the point where realize that there are

00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:50,030
multiple corridors that are connected

00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:54,020
have different names and therefore you

00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:58,400
want to one possibility to met two

00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:02,420
corridors that have no wall between them

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,660
and that is the idea behind rooms are

00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:07,130
something that's by default closed

00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:10,040
whereas corridors are something that's

00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:13,070
by default open so that's the convention

00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:15,290
bits addressed to have it that way to

00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:18,440
make it as simple as possible to just

00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:20,930
draw rooms and corridors and it's a

00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,030
chest by default correct behavior and

00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:30,770
you only need to fix it with extra walls

00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:32,740
or excess texts in very few cases yeah

00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:37,550
shops are not much of a problem as

00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:40,400
mentioned so four levels we came between

00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:42,740
another problem the basic idea is you

00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,530
try to keep the level numberings that

00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:47,900
the operator of the building has

00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,580
introduced you often find clever numbers

00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:53,090
in the elevators for example they tell

00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:56,450
you this is level -2 level minus 1 or so

00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:59,570
but you often have these intermediate

00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:01,400
levels and you would like to give them a

00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:04,640
number at least to make sense of steps

00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:09,100
for example so which addressed to have

00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:12,400
in this case really fractional numbers

00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:14,990
that year is to have one digit behind

00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,940
juice mostly wanting it behind it's

00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:19,730
exactly enough for any station we ever

00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:21,200
found but it's really important that

00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:28,400
tools should consider that there could

00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:31,070
be fracture numbers for 4 levels ok and

00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,050
stairs similar stairs something we have

00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:37,460
already thought about why it's important

00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:39,230
to have both the way and the area you

00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:41,480
can get away with the way only if you

00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:43,890
are freely a simple erect Andrea case

00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:47,400
but then still it's really

00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:51,059
depend to do routing properly to cut out

00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,880
this this rectangle from the underlying

00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:57,150
platform for example or corridor and not

00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,549
to send people across this way on the

00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:02,069
underlying corridor because you weren't

00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:05,160
aware that let's say we have to cross

00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:07,799
through through steps that are just for

00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,319
up a meter or so here if the steps start

00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:14,130
here so this is why we charge s to have

00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:19,079
simply always around the around a simple

00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:22,019
steps way this this closed way to mark

00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:24,990
the area that is otherwise blocked in

00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:30,660
the underlying lever for being used for

00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:34,980
walking this is just an example again

00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:40,010
here you know it looks like so again I

00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:43,829
think it was so it's really like

00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:46,500
refinement we don't do you don't change

00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:50,039
so much it exists might make it finer we

00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,799
get much more areas inside and one thing

00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:55,440
is also important to mention the

00:51:51,799 --> 00:52:02,640
elevators because we can also map a bit

00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:05,640
wrong like this one here it's beginning

00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:08,759
if you think about the idea having first

00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,750
very primitive element like a node and

00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:11,609
then of course you've got better

00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:15,920
measurements you can do it all scenario

00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:19,529
so then one of the early idea was to

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:23,579
neglect the point and just take the

00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:26,640
battery find one with the tag highway

00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:28,769
gleich elevator but that makes a lot of

00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,069
problems in this routine it was one of

00:52:28,769 --> 00:52:33,960
the reason not to do it so we introduced

00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:37,200
another a new feature very currently

00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:40,230
called building part elevator which

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:45,210
defines the area but the routing element

00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:48,900
the highway element still remains a node

00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:51,289
you sometimes map different in that

00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:54,450
sense and better support and routing

00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:55,360
things it's not that clear this drawing

00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:58,030
is

00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:01,840
you also would like to have a way ending

00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:03,100
in this point because you really need to

00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:06,160
know where the doors are

00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:07,930
it's a difference whether the drawers

00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,230
are here or here and there are a lot of

00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:13,120
stations where you cannot conclude from

00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:18,400
the surroundings where the doors are and

00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:21,010
it's it wouldn't work for for giving

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,590
directions for blind people on would be

00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:26,470
even awkward for giving directions for

00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:28,570
wheelchair meet users if they would end

00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:30,490
up before a wall and then have to figure

00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:35,260
out themselves how to get around the

00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:37,030
wall to get to finally find the doors of

00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:39,070
the elevators they're there for beach at

00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:41,500
rest to have a can this double mapping

00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:45,490
to be as backwards-compatible as

00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:48,400
possible with away from the outside to

00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:51,280
the center and node representing the

00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,100
center to do all the routing and the

00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,940
rectangular to represent the real easy

00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:59,920
area used a better bonus you get from

00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:03,040
this is when if you have an elevator as

00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:06,310
it doesn't stop at every lover you can

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,320
add the levers whereas the elevator is

00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:12,730
physical present but not necessarily

00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:14,860
stops or to the level list of the area

00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:17,650
and they are cut out from the errors and

00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:20,530
not otherwise used and you can restrict

00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:22,420
the levels to this to restricted levels

00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:25,270
on this node to those levels where the

00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:30,220
elevator actually stops so you get this

00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:34,270
for free if you agree on having a posts

00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:38,290
a note away and a closed way to

00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:41,050
represent an elevator with elevators

00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:43,540
maybe also one thing important how many

00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:49,210
elevators you grasp the deutsche bahn

00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:51,640
operates in germany hence are poor

00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:56,850
things that the German railways operate

00:54:51,640 --> 00:55:01,150
more than a hundred more than a thousand

00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:03,130
more than ten thousand all this

00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:05,260
optimistic it's I think it's two

00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:08,590
thousand and something

00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:10,600
so as an experiment also to get an

00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:13,270
understanding how long it takes to map

00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:15,940
for in select Germany we did also a

00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:19,060
project in that sense that we knew open

00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:22,630
data how many and also which stations

00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:26,140
had elevators but we wanted to have them

00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:29,590
in OpenStreetMap so we done it in about

00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:30,910
half a year to bring all elevators into

00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:34,060
the OpenStreetMap where we did an

00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:37,690
approach like bit mixture at 80% by

00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:39,580
volunteer service and mappers we did

00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:42,460
also like we hackathons on this and then

00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:45,730
add maybe 20% for no Aslam mapper was

00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:48,940
there so we went as a company also to

00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:51,400
collect them and to make sure that we

00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:57,820
could full coverage just September we

00:55:51,400 --> 00:56:01,510
did now all the escalators any idea

00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:03,940
about the escalators so all so many of

00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:05,800
them are a bit different because the

00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:09,270
reason is now visitor Japan they know

00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:13,690
exactly which operators run sorry which

00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:16,990
which escalators and elevators are in a

00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:18,850
running mode or hey a broken and this is

00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:21,310
also something you can get into yep no

00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:23,560
it's good this is because I'm not going

00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:26,200
we're running out of time now so this is

00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:30,550
an example you can see how things being

00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:32,650
mapped by examples but today as you know

00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:34,980
there are many stations also inside your

00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:37,630
country also go on the life examples

00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:39,369
routing is also not very difficult just

00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:42,250
make sure that you have the level tip

00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:45,930
inside and those who do programming on

00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:50,920
routing routing engines and you have

00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:54,130
potentially a level tag and it cannot do

00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:56,440
indoor routing then d aware maybe to

00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:57,609
ignore them because in the 2d world what

00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,250
we have in OpenStreetMap

00:56:57,609 --> 00:57:02,560
you may have two ways but one is in the

00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:05,380
upper level and it's a lower level and

00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:07,600
they might be connected just because of

00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:10,390
practical reasons but in the real world

00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:12,220
they are in the 3d world so be aware

00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:14,830
about this if there is a level check

00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,720
maybe better even ignore it or make it

00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:20,470
rigged correct through

00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:23,170
stairs and ethnics the very last point

00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:26,110
is a bit and also one of the major point

00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:28,660
was let me later on this idea to meet it

00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:31,350
the way I came to Berlin Simon who is

00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:35,740
also coming so that we may have a little

00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:39,670
enhancement of simple indoor profile 1.1

00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:43,330
after three four years to bring in these

00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:45,720
things because maybe it's a better

00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:50,320
alignment if we do it

00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:52,410
Remz also doors maybe just to say at the

00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:56,880
beginning I was very eager indoors even

00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:59,830
was mapping on ways to know how large

00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,390
doris nowadays the south to neglect them

00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:05,020
because we have to solve first the

00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:06,610
area's this is something which also

00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,810
platform is another thing we need to

00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:10,030
think about we need to think about

00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:12,340
tracks and platform this also something

00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:14,830
we need to discuss because the current

00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:17,310
situation on the platform which is not

00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:21,010
the track it's not very sufficient for

00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:24,040
passengers so this is maybe also a

00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:28,720
conflict from the aerial view like level

00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:31,450
two to the current view yeah maybe some

00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:35,350
tools at the very end we just introduced

00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:38,290
the WebGL version the best thing is

00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:39,700
there it is also sweating a bit because

00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:41,350
sometimes it's works as if that this

00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,880
works not so you will see the newer

00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:46,510
version if you would like to go online

00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,950
as WebGL but there also the classic one

00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:50,140
we know that we have to also have

00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:53,020
different visualization styles like a

00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:54,600
generic one we need and I think we will

00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:57,330
need more tools

00:58:54,600 --> 00:59:01,630
I'll probably get the conclusion which

00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:03,490
one can do we also like of course to

00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:05,980
motivate you to start mapping this is

00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:09,040
one of the ideas and if somebody

00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:12,820
interested in going to ëtil back we will

00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:17,880
meet up at that door but maybe now if I

00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:17,880
use a conclusion do you want

00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:30,840
to compute C to conclude things it's

00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:35,670
feasible the point is if you really look

00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:38,490
at just really lots lots of elements

00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:42,570
that people get ahead a seem to Bank a

00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:45,780
thing you talk and but it is feasible

00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:48,450
let's just start to develop some proper

00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:50,720
truths and just thought with laser

00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:53,370
distance measurement device or even with

00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:57,450
counting steps as I have presented and

00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:59,370
to get already reasonable forms for the

00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:00,900
platform but really the critical point

00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:06,660
is there are a lot of situations where

01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:09,560
you if you try to set some fancy texts

01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:14,310
on ways just to retain the way model

01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:17,520
usually when you start to deform deform

01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:19,890
walk up an area a walkable areas of

01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,350
walkable infrastructure it turns out

01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:24,480
it's most of the time in eating area so

01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:27,330
it's really we have to get used to that

01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,580
when we get into indoor it's most of the

01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:32,340
time it's anything that's walkable will

01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:34,590
end up as an area and we have to

01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:37,790
organize things shots at the existing

01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:39,900
tools work best with this transition

01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:44,490
simple indoor toss already a lot of

01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:50,040
artists it's also not about areas and as

01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:52,080
it turns out sensitive points are

01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,050
getting elevations ride in particular

01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:57,390
such situations don't stop everywhere

01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:59,520
where they are physically present get

01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:01,740
steps right in particular steps that are

01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:07,380
very wide and have a really irregular

01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:10,410
form and in general the tooling is not

01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:12,570
yet in the sense that you could say

01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:16,440
everything you would reasonably expect

01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:19,320
is there so it's probably we are we hope

01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:22,380
that over the next year indoor mapping

01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:24,080
will get easier when the tools were able

01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:28,190
to do a lot of these

01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:30,410
version work on the fly from the few

01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:32,750
numbers you get when you walk when you

01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:36,050
walk down a platform or when you measure

01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:36,860
the stairwell and so on so thank you for

01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:41,930
your attention

01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:47,900
sorry I think yeah other questions so

01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:52,430
far don't thank you violent of Niland

01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:55,910
and to his questions let's go you first

01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:58,730
get your name right cuz I'm here it's

01:01:55,910 --> 01:02:01,220
not because I'm better thank you this

01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:03,770
was interesting you made me think of one

01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:08,150
of my favorite movies

01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:09,610
it's called heat by Michael Mann 95 I

01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:11,810
don't know if some of you know the movie

01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:13,760
the beginning of the movies in Los

01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:17,510
Angeles and it's at the Los Angeles

01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,230
train station and it's wonderful it's

01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:21,530
beautiful

01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:24,950
and my question is this how will you

01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:28,460
make your map more interactive in the

01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:30,800
future more 3-dimension because right

01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:33,530
now it feels a bit cold where it is

01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:41,600
colder than then heat by Michael Mann

01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:44,510
obviously thanks a lot that gives you

01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:47,870
some tuna 1/2 dimensions in the sense

01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:50,920
that you could that you could excuse

01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:56,060
this chosen to an isometric presentation

01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:58,250
but it's still the average user won't

01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:00,620
make sense of this it's impressive but

01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:03,830
it's not informated you just get lost in

01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:07,370
this impressive half cut three seas

01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:10,090
there's through dancing and ask okay and

01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:13,010
how do I get down to this platform so

01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:15,710
the tooling has started a lot of things

01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:17,150
work but we are at the point with you

01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:19,190
where the end users rubies the

01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:21,440
passengers that know not much about 3d

01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:25,460
and I was Emmental so on but I really

01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:27,230
could make sense of of the things that

01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:30,260
are the output of the cutting edge tools

01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:31,760
so I think it's a problem of doing a

01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:35,350
proper user interface it's the moment

01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:39,020
not so much about tuning such so

01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:40,610
stay tuned what presentations mayor I

01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:45,860
have to turned out to be useful in

01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:47,480
practice almost never mess because

01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,730
people are used to these two Tila

01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:52,300
remnants whereas I can switch the level

01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:54,560
that's what the average user understands

01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,610
also like the last where can for

01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,160
instance there were many companies

01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:59,660
offering good apps very good apps but I

01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,970
think it's a good idea also to line them

01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:06,860
up very often the good apps are very

01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:09,530
reduced a specific hotel or worse

01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:11,150
specific location well also with the

01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:13,040
idea of up street maybe out the idea of

01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:14,990
a generic one when you walk into this

01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,340
building and never was here and you

01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:20,690
could automatically fetch the data

01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:22,820
because student map that before and OSM

01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:25,970
opus treatment can share this data may

01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:29,660
be on top but this is a crucial point to

01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:31,850
make it nicely I'm interested in the

01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:34,490
indoor and station mapping from the

01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:36,350
point of view of a blind friend so I'd

01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:38,690
say that I'm sure the pillars are very

01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:41,570
important as a landmark because they

01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:44,060
make an echo as you walk past but also

01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:46,630
maybe suggest mapping noisy things like

01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:49,160
the announcement system loudspeakers or

01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:51,800
fans air conditioning which is

01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,800
continuously on for people who navigate

01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:56,240
by sound indoors

01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,490
what it segrete what's a great idea we

01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:01,700
have never thought about this I think

01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:03,500
just to change the scheme I think it's

01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,690
the moment would expect it's mostly no

01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:08,420
it's about to position end but I've no

01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:11,900
idea how to cut cover a noise I think

01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:13,460
just having in URL was pro of the noise

01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,680
is probably not helpful when you think

01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:19,090
about speakers and even other devices

01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,090
may vary over the day

01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:36,869
hello shall we I I work with Adria in

01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:40,890
mapping Paris railway stations what was

01:05:36,869 --> 01:05:44,040
really interesting is to know what is

01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:49,710
the topology of objects we can find in

01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:52,260
railway stations and my job is to to

01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:55,440
help people for disability you know

01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:59,400
accessibility and what is interesting is

01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:02,339
to know if we are able to create a

01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:05,670
topology of every object that we could

01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:09,390
push in wiki data and afterward give

01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:12,500
pictures of you know vending machine and

01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:16,280
all this and in the whole world show

01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:19,230
what are the tags and the type of

01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:22,079
machine in different country it would

01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:23,579
help to know the name and the tax

01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,500
because it is quite complicated to

01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:29,220
understand what is the difference

01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:32,520
between one machine and the other one

01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:35,790
way we use to go faster is to use

01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:39,660
immersive camera you know 360 and I

01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:42,390
didn't use any paper only by taking this

01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:46,349
picture I placed them in mapillary and

01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:48,569
afterward it was really easy knowing the

01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:52,220
measurement of machine and know by

01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:55,130
extrapolation what are the distance and

01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:58,680
everything and it was very useful

01:06:55,130 --> 01:07:05,970
searching we use a lot emergency map and

01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:09,089
it is really useful to push path way and

01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:12,690
all this so it is a good way and so we

01:07:09,089 --> 01:07:16,970
are working the idea of Adria to have

01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:21,859
something to help people that not easy

01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:26,720
user of Java open map to squirrel

01:07:21,859 --> 01:07:26,720
emergency map and to help mapping

01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:38,609
you hit on the problem now about direct

01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:40,380
I derived work so when we started all

01:07:38,609 --> 01:07:43,589
the ideas of course emergency maps or

01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:48,510
any CID plans was not yet but it's not

01:07:43,589 --> 01:07:51,150
your work which means you're not allowed

01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:53,369
you're not allowed to use it except you

01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:55,890
have in a contract from the Creator

01:07:53,369 --> 01:08:03,450
through the organization's to the very

01:07:55,890 --> 01:08:06,930
end to a compatible Oh TBL license so on

01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:08,789
the one hand side this is a it's a very

01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:13,140
very critical position from a legal

01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:15,630
position not very compatible to osm on

01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:18,179
the island there might be contract but

01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:20,310
if you cooperate maybe this works but

01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:22,500
you have to really ensure it another

01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:26,730
reason was very often that these rescue

01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:29,750
mans also this general CID cut plans got

01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:35,460
outdated because there is always change

01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:36,839
so said yes one idea but because there

01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:39,569
are so many things in the one inside one

01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:41,730
experiences you must go to the stage you

01:08:39,569 --> 01:08:43,620
must go into the buildings to understand

01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:46,560
you cannot do it remotely it will do

01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:51,239
makes too much errors the second point

01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:55,770
is really that this is what you can grab

01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:58,020
from the current state so of course this

01:08:55,770 --> 01:09:00,000
will change also so we have to update

01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:02,339
from sooner or later also and

01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,980
nevertheless the idea is good if you do

01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:07,889
run don't buy open data policies for

01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:09,900
instance if SNCF has a portal portal as

01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:11,279
we have said but they have to also

01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:16,230
publish please

01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:18,239
these cid maps and not all of them are

01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:20,909
very happy to do with this because very

01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:24,960
often directed to get out and to

01:09:20,909 --> 01:09:26,969
dangerous or make a different contract

01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,670
somehow but really make sure that you

01:09:26,969 --> 01:09:31,650
have the rights and it's not their

01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:33,810
picture taken from an emergency

01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:36,130
somewhere here in the building then it

01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:39,080
has no rights

01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:42,320
on question back maybe just shortly and

01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:44,180
how do you make see exactly how do you

01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:46,609
figure out the exact position of the

01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:56,360
photo I mean you have no GPS was in the

01:09:46,609 --> 01:09:59,500
building yes when I take pictures I know

01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:03,850
that I have took to take pictures every

01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:07,640
maybe five seconds and I do regular

01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:12,250
pacing in the station and I go from the

01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:16,250
entrance to the exit and then I do some

01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:20,980
logical path and after what I try to

01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:26,710
take the emergency map to squirrel

01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:33,020
location handli way so it is the first

01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:35,780
hardest way to give accurate location

01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:39,470
and afterward it will have but it is not

01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:42,760
it is maybe 2 meter precision but it is

01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:50,620
enough because I only need to after

01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:50,620
observe survey thank you thank you I

01:10:52,060 --> 01:11:00,400
would like to to say something about

01:10:56,290 --> 01:11:03,950
emergency maps we came to conclusion but

01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:06,770
maybe it has no copyright because it's

01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:11,420
not something creative you know it's not

01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:15,020
a creative art it's not just it's a

01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:17,480
public information which is shown on the

01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:22,100
building so maybe it has no copyright

01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:28,490
because it's not creative and we we try

01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:32,570
I try to solution mapping by end with

01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:37,310
measuring distances everything and using

01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:41,960
as a base an emergency map even if it's

01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:42,720
not always up-to-date it's a convenient

01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,750
to

01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:48,720
to use it as a base because you don't

01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:51,630
have to spend or like a few hours in the

01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:56,730
building to have a base map you can have

01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:59,370
something to create the the main

01:11:56,730 --> 01:12:03,570
structure of a building and then refine

01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:06,690
it because if you do it all by nu you

01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:10,200
spend obviously hours for the simple

01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:14,760
station so even if you have powerful

01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:19,790
tools or like lands a and K and so you

01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:24,210
will still need a lot of time to do so

01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:27,060
it's just response even if I take a

01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:29,760
picture of you I say I'm not a creator

01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:33,380
of fancy things it's already of course

01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:37,260
copyrighted Maps are clear copyrighted

01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:39,120
emergency maps by the way same so there

01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:43,200
are it's so convenient because somebody

01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:46,170
other did the work for you so be really

01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:49,320
aware this is a very crucial point make

01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:51,960
sure that you have the contracts and

01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:54,390
it's really very clear that maps also

01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:56,610
emergencies are because all the things

01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:58,620
that you have a certain level and maps

01:12:56,610 --> 01:13:01,050
are spend a lot of work to create that's

01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:03,120
why we're doing I'm gonna I'm gonna move

01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:06,810
on from that so I think if it's if it's

01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:08,820
taking us time and the emergency maps is

01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:11,040
speeding up I think then the emergency

01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:13,530
map has taken time to create and there's

01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,420
definitely a copyright question there

01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:19,110
that you need to be careful of but

01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:21,660
that's a data working group question and

01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:23,970
I'd say make sure you're talking to the

01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:25,680
guys involved in that and we've got a

01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:27,900
few guys around here that that know

01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,820
about the copyright quite well so we'll

01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:34,910
move on and last question is it still

01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:34,910
about railways in it or nothing yes

01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:40,410
probably a difference a slight

01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:44,670
difference between the different-- or

01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:47,820
instructions in France in Germany and we

01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:51,000
have we don't like it but factually we

01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:54,010
have a very aggressive jurisdiction in

01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,380
Germany about maps really had the city

01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:57,940
which are completely brain-dead there

01:13:56,380 --> 01:14:01,239
are something like a dentist's not

01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:03,550
carrying about much ditch this map of

01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:08,650
the size of a stem and was convicted to

01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:12,700
pay a five day which fee for using the

01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:16,030
stem sized cut out from a med so it's

01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:18,760
really the unfortunate EU loss and

01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:20,500
Germany are really very aggressive and

01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,480
really taken by the courts very

01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,970
aggressive therefore I think it's it's

01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:28,870
point specifically to to the Germans

01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:30,820
very sensitive I can understand it's

01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:32,770
probably more relaxed in France

01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:34,930
concerning this particular serration I

01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:37,989
don't know about the other countries but

01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:42,850
the general stance is that the the data

01:14:37,989 --> 01:14:45,820
working group tends to tend to get along

01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:49,270
with the most restrictive restriction to

01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:51,610
avoid that you could just got caught by

01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:55,080
a lawyer and the wrongdoer restriction

01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:57,790
you didn't have sort of okay I have a

01:14:55,080 --> 01:15:01,510
very simple thing solution for this

01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:04,030
problem why don't you use this route

01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:05,830
meters the big wheels which are you can

01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:11,290
carry have you tried it I would combine

01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:13,750
this with luggage with with wheels so I

01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:17,739
can just walk around it can quite easily

01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:20,350
measure even your turns and distances

01:15:17,739 --> 01:15:23,380
and records is without says funny long

01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:25,350
steps have you tried this not yet but my

01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:28,000
hope your rights please don't do it

01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:32,050
not yet but the idea to have a charlie

01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,510
was a distance meter it's very yes well

01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:37,960
it's impressive I tried to make this

01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:39,520
aperture nice challenge to have to have

01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:42,130
a meter was in my trolley

01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:44,470
we tried this I have also by the way the

01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:46,480
roll a bit and the torture bonacic ovata

01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:49,270
so we did we invited a lot of indoor

01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:53,160
companies also also non OpenStreetMap

01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:57,820
companies and also idiot very visualized

01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:59,230
then you need tonight and by the way we

01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:01,449
started in

01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:03,900
Berlin Zoo quiets which is not a large

01:16:01,449 --> 01:16:07,449
station at four o'clock in the morning

01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:09,340
and because if you have too many people

01:16:07,449 --> 01:16:11,620
already running around get permanent

01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:13,150
problems they had also in history

01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:15,280
problems because the taking also by the

01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:20,020
way pictures there were some people

01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:21,360
coming on your really disturbing is I

01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:23,620
have to go through the night it means

01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,960
it's an idea but you have in this case

01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:27,989
really cooperate with the operator with

01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:30,670
the Deutsche Bahn which makes it usually

01:16:27,989 --> 01:16:34,270
not so easy to start a second point is a

01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:36,160
bit this is very fast and if you have a

01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:39,310
very long distance where nothing really

01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:42,280
changes because like a platform it's

01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:44,650
it's very often relative fast but

01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:46,690
practice of course you have no pictures

01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:49,690
and that sends like Street View hope as

01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:52,480
we maybe have in future opens indoor

01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:54,760
street view from Philippi should talk

01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:58,120
about but then we have to solve the

01:16:54,760 --> 01:17:01,020
positioning also so it took a really

01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:03,130
long time much much more than that so

01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:05,830
this is very practical that's why I

01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:08,650
suggest simple it's a simple indoor

01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:10,660
profile start quickly with that and I'm

01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:13,630
very sure they can make much progress

01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:16,630
even with simple tools also there might

01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:18,310
be better once also refinements and I I

01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:20,770
would quite like to see very limb with

01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:22,810
his suitcase that has one big wheel to

01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:24,340
measure it but I think he loves his

01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:26,020
laser pointer to might so I'm gonna

01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:28,230
thank Roland and Roland thank you very

01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:28,230
