Title: 2019: Introduce OpenPlaceReviews and connect to OpenStreetMap
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019. Day 3, HÃ¶rsaal Ost
Description: 
	As of today we have OpenStreetMap but it doesn't fit all data and some data is not recommended for submission. We've got user reviews request in OsmAnd and Maps.Me and we would like to collaborate with OpenStreetMap community to create independent open platform for reviews.

I would like to talk about how data could be stored and moderated and would like to explain how that data will be further integrated with OpenStreetMap and will be contributed back to OSM! 

One of the main contribution to OSM database itself will be justified places and details of places itself. I will explain how tools will validate License sanity and avoid Import problem to OSM i.e. how every edit will be administered by OSM-user. In the end we would like to have seamless OSM user experience integration and create open OSM-satellite project.

*OpenPlaceReviews - A new way for local reviews*
Open. Collaborative. Trustworthy.

Openness - make all the reviews data open, so every project can access and contribute back.
Community driven - build a community to make decision about moderation, data structure together.
Decentralization - develop a decentralized system from the Day 1 to avoid scalability issues in the future.
Trust - create tools to detect fraud, spam & keep all the data open to prevent any data manipulation.
Monetization - make business subscriptions once the project is matured and spread the income between applications, authors, moderators and network operators.

	                              welcome to the next talk here at Sutton                                                                     we'll talk about open place reviews now                               and how to connect data to OpenStreetMap                               yes thank you hello everybody                               I'm Victor sharp I'm mostly known as a                               founder of Osment mobile maps and                               navigation and today and we'll talk                               about completely different topic about a                                new project that we are trying to start                                which results could be used in osmond                                but it is mostly targeted to fix as a                                mission blocks in OpenStreetMap and to                                cover and to create a place directory                                which we see in products like                                TripAdvisor or Google Maps let me first                                of all start by congratulating all of us                                that we reach so many people that                                OpenStreetMap reach so many people in                                the world so it is even hard to count                                how many people use in OpenStreetMap                                directly or indirectly there are                                probably                                                            that have more than                                                    and osmond is one of them I really hope                                that audience of OpenStreetMap will                                continue to grow and be basically the                                biggest Maps audience of Google Maps of                                                                                                        by far but so far we need to overcome                                many difficulties we have with Open                                Street Map we till this and I think we                                deserve more open world in a                                     century let's take a look first of all                                what I mean by vision Blox                                we all know that not all data can feed                                OpenStreetMap of course we could say                                that is not a business of Open Street                                Map to deal with the data like places                                photo assert a.m. data public transport                                shadow place reviews                                                    a microphone mapping staff it is a very                                long list what is related to Open Street                                Map but is not but it doesn't belongs to                                it yet                                or anyway people expectation is quite                                high and they expect full service of                                applications they use and great                                experience so all features need to be                                interconnected with each other for                                example today we will have a different                                talk about public transport which we did                                on based on OpenStreetMap data and where                                we deal with the problems that transport                                is not much useful when we don't have a                                transfer shadow and transfer Shadle                                doesn't belong to OpenStreetMap and and                                we need to build a connection where what                                services provide and it needs to be open                                enough so every every project can use it                                and but there is nothing wrong that                                OpenStreetMap doesn't accept all the                                data clearly because that data cannot                                doesn't fit well into main dataset just                                let's take a look for example that                                datasets which were which are primary                                and still exists like GPX tracks were                                very important in the beginning of the                                project but not anymore because now                                we're using more satellite imagery and                                so on and API is quite limited we don't                                even have full damps of GPX tracks                                anymore since                                                           expect that reviews could feed                                OpenStreetMap data set not only because                                it doesn't fit it's because resources                                that maintain OpenStreetMap rep is                                limited and we need to do a lot we need                                to build many satellites projects to fix                                the gap well meanwhile I think why we                                cannot fix a gap is a problem of                                Technology so obviously we need to have                                a technology that can fit or it can                                store more data than OpenStreetMap but                                it also need to be interconnected to                                store connections like relation energy                                with third party edges between                                OpenStreetMap and third my third party                                data so on this slide you can see what I                                listed as expectation from technology to                                be used for this mission                                first of all and the data should be open                                so everybody who has access and can use                                OpenStreetMap data can use this data as                                well it should be community driven there                                is no kind of sense today in a permanent                                static data set because the world is                                changing especially in the map related                                things and it needs to be driven by a                                 community similar to how Open Street Map                                 is driven it should be decentralized                                 that's what we are missing a little bit                                 from osm a main source because we have                                 put in quite a high load on the main                                 servers which results they become really                                 critical and doesn't give enough                                 flexibility to provide a different                                 version of API different version of                                 something so it's better when it will be                                 decentralized so it will be less load                                 and it's easier to maintain and of                                 course it should support to store big                                 data at least one terabyte of data I                                 would say it's a big data that's what we                                 need at least of course that's quite                                 many limitation for that technology and                                 maybe that's why it doesn't exist so we                                 can easily take it and reuse it but I                                 believe if we start a project we do a                                 mistake so the successor of course will                                 think that mistake and eventually we                                 will get the technology that will fit                                 really well to us even though in the                                 beginning we were focused mostly on                                 development a product for storing                                 reviews we understand that many things                                 we need to do is quite generic so we                                 separate projects in two parts one of                                 them is a database where we store stuff                                 and the Dylan is API and another thing                                 is basically reviews related stuff from                                 the day one I was looking for that for                                 technologies that can really fit well to                                 be open decentralized community driven                                 and be able to store big data and and                                 there was no not such technology that                                 solves everything even though I am a big                                 fan of blockchain project of                                 pure idea of how that works if we remove                                 financial part of it for example it                                 satisfies many of the criterias it could                                 be open there are some really                                 community-driven block chains it's by                                 default decentralized it provides API                                 but it is extremely expensive for                                 example storing one megabyte in a public                                 blockchain like a Bitcoin store costs                                 you ten thousand dollars and in some                                 other about $                                                         broken there and well we will talk about                                 it later what's broken so and we don't                                 have enough so here you see pluses and                                 minuses of it and it's great to combine                                 both walls and benefit from both bars so                                 from database we can have a optimized                                 data access we have many tools how we                                 can build a website because it's hard to                                 build a website just on the role API you                                 prefer to have with some mappings and                                 strong and this database it sells easier                                 because you have a centralized                                 maintenance so that's what we had we                                 were trying to achieve but of course we                                 need to make compromises otherwise it's                                 it's just great walls so one of them is                                 to be of course don't want to have a                                 miners because they produce at extreme                                 cost of storage and that means that we                                 cannot rely on a proof of work but we                                 still can rely of proof of stake or                                 proof of authority which will rely a lot                                 and for example in OpenStreetMap world                                 when because we trust what comes from my                                 main servers and so on and we know how                                 to deal if something is broken                                 also we don't have a built-in spam                                 protection in with the public blockchain                                 spam protection is just the cost you                                 need to pay for what you put in                                 blockchain nobody cares basically what                                 you put and we don't have that but in                                 projects like Wikipedia in OpenStreetMap                                 we we kind of develop in the culture                                 what it means to maintain to reverse                                 stuff and to deal with the spam and to                                 detect quite a few some presentation                                 this sort my about vandalism and how we                                 deal with it and how we check it                                 actually if you look at in a nutshell                                 OpenStreetMap has lots of benefits with                                 OpenStreetMap has a lot of similarities                                 with the blockchain so if we compare                                 just changesets with blocks                                 well basically sorry mini gives as a                                 blocks and change this will be a                                 transactions so you can see that blocks                                 come every minute there is a practical                                 size limitation how big minute if could                                 be and it's of course it's purely                                 centralized blockchain because it's                                 controlled by one entity but there is of                                 course the centralization of how many                                 tools how many editors can deal this                                 OpenStreetMap but of course it's very                                 specific blockchain                                 so that's a technology that I see who                                 could work the fill the gaps even though                                 we will be spent like six months seven                                 months to build the technology and we                                 are not there yet so expect and we still                                 have quite a lot of quite a big backlog                                 but I think in the to three months it                                 will be ready for first releases or for                                 place reviews so let's see how what it                                 means actually plays directories and                                 reviews this is a typical screen shows                                 how it could looks like they're taken                                 from Google Maps you see menus you see                                 photos you see a review segregated data                                 and there is subjective and objective                                 information obviously objective                                 information we can put an input street                                 map and it's already there sometimes but                                 is it is not verified regularly not                                 checked so that's a little bit of an                                 issue there I think when we see the                                 screens we actually think okay these are                                 important screens and if we manage to do                                 something similar in OpenStreetMap it                                 will help to convert more people that                                 that use everyday map application into                                 Open Street Map and basically expand our                                 community so let's take a look wick look                                 at the market of this application so we                                 have Google Maps TripAdvisor Yelp and                                 obviously there is no as we see Google                                 dominates on that market much more even                                 than between map application because                                 there's a                                 OpenStreetMap which competes with it and                                 here there is no open alternative even                                 by a scale of                                                          Maps and if you think that data                                 duplicates quite fast every to each                                 three years it needs to change in                                 reviews because it doesn't make sense                                 anymore so it's easy to extrapolate that                                 Google domination belong the exede and                                 in five years it will be just enormous                                 because only Google among these                                 applications provides map good map and                                 which means that it converts more and                                 more people and gets more and more data                                 here I'm not representing only myself                                 but Elsa maps me because we had a shared                                 agreement that we need to work on our                                 open data set to store reviews and we                                 hope that in a year we could reach one                                 or ten between one and ten percent of                                 the market by just sharing the reviews                                 Maps me already has rabies but they are                                 not open yet let's have a quick look how                                 it could work so we can see the main                                 actors on the screen like geo apps is                                 one part of the system open street map                                 as a separate one and we have a business                                 owners and their websites where they                                 maintain the data about themselves and                                 and in the center we see open place                                 reviews data set which is of course                                 guarded by a community like Open Street                                 Map so let's take a look a little bit                                 deeper and let's see how benefit from                                 each other Gio apps and community and                                 open place reviews projects so it's                                 pretty pretty in principle it's very                                 similar how it works to david's                                 OpenStreetMap because awesome and masked                                 me can contribute individual edits from                                 users for example about places but on                                 the second they get aggregated data back                                 in up here it could be aggregated                                 reviews that they can download and                                 people can use it offline photos about                                 the places and so on and in the back                                 what's important to say as well that                                 our target to make it compatible with OS                                 M format so every application can easily                                 integrate it in their stream in their                                 data flow because it's already to us                                 with OpenStreetMap data if we take a                                 look how it could be in how it could be                                 beneficial with OpenStreetMap                                 integration we could see that initial                                 input of course is done from                                 OpenStreetMap where we take place and                                 text locations but what we can                                 contribute back is to verify the                                 presence of a place if it has exactly                                 the same name or not we have already a                                 street complete tools other tools to                                 help but of course another tool if it                                 works if it focuses on one thing can                                 only make it better and what we are                                 targeting to push import like verified                                 present if it's still exists or not and                                 some details like opening hours and                                 cuisine of course what we need to make                                 sure that license is compatible with the                                 OpenStreetMap and that import is                                 semi-automated and the license we choose                                 and for both contribution terms and                                 database export to be she zero because                                 it's very close to public domain and                                 it's for sure compatible with Open                                 Street Map but of course it's a                                 beginning of the process we need to give                                 a proper waiver right wikipage how it                                 could be done and we don't want of                                 course to be it automatic it will be                                 always semi-automatic but there are                                 simple techniques we can follow it for                                 example place was not updated to an Open                                 Street Map and user case for example                                 even account on Open Street Map and just                                 using that tool to verify of place                                 exists of course we can contribute it                                 back to Open Street Map but we need to                                 be careful and take that step by step of                                 course and the first step would be to                                 collect the data and second to start                                 looking into details to negotiate how                                 that process could work of importing the                                 third one link is quite interesting                                 because it's it doesn't work with Open                                 Street Map is                                 collecting data with third party it's                                 very simple similar to import but there                                 is a main difference so you in                                 OpenStreetMap import works once once it                                 ends up in OpenStreetMap which actually                                 slows down many inputs especially when                                 we don't know the license and and                                 sometimes it's just Russians importantly                                 a pollutant the main dataset what we see                                 is that we can collect data but not use                                 it for what we can collect and group it                                 by sources unless we get a clear                                 understanding a key that it is fine to                                 import but there is no need to kind of                                 merge it immediately we can still keep                                 it as a source and for example                                 communities can define what source is                                 most reliable for example is a source                                 from a website of the business owner and                                 we have a permission for example to use                                 it and even if we don't have a                                 permission to import it to open source                                 map still many geo apps can follow for                                 example guidelines to put proper                                 attribution and display that data which                                 is a great benefit as well because                                 end-users will will see that data that                                 will not be lost even though it has a                                 special attribution that that is not                                 compatible with OpenStreetMap license so                                 what we think is - to at least collect                                 information from websites using                                 crowler's and do similar job as a web                                 search engine do just to present a case                                 the link and where's the ticket is taken                                 from for example the r                                                   this is what actually search engines do                                 but of course we the source should stay                                 very clear and it shouldn't mix mix up                                 things what people see what was taken                                 automatically and so on Oh a few words                                 about the current status and the main                                 thing I want to mention that there is no                                 public release yet and you probably can                                 follow the news on our forum or website                                 once it happens we started back in                                 February by developed and the core of                                 the blockchain called open DB in the                                 June we already did the initial awesome                                 part of all of about two million places                                 and now it's getting in sync so the                                 import took about four hours and now                                 it's a synchronized every half an hour                                 so it's a maintained and it's stored in                                 blockchain so it's kind of optimized it                                 was tricky to get it done and the last                                 months we started to working on the                                 mobile clients to display the data it's                                 nothing special but it's using that                                 blockchain already to display the data                                 it's not using techniques like Osmond                                 does so it's pretty interesting and of                                 course because technology be used as a                                 blockchain it's immediately provides API                                 to edit a me to read information to                                 download we're working to extend that                                 API and right now                                 the mobile client is in progress and we                                 are working to start uploading data to                                 blockchain for examples to be simple                                 photos about places and the simple                                 information if please present or not and                                 in the future we really ends at the                                 moment we are going to make a public                                 race now meanwhile we are working on                                 blockchain Explorer it is ready but we                                 more we want to make it more kind of                                 usable and the main thing of course we                                 are trying to gather a community gather                                 opinions for people think about it                                 whether they want to contribute in what                                 way and so on in futures there are lots                                 of tasks to be done to create a rich                                 website functionality that that people                                 can work to administers data to have a                                 web crawlers configuration and to to do                                 something similar that Open Street Map                                 has with proposals and defining a tacit                                 schema so this this is kind of the road                                 map II we hope to be done in                                             last but not least I would like to have                                 I would like to say that some big                                 projects and contributions of course of                                 welcome you can find us on telegram                                 channel or on our forum the links will                                 be present on the last slide but here                                 you can see three main tracks we we                                 welcome contribution developers of                                 course                                 of Java language can contribute to the                                 blockchain itself or defining new                                 crowler's or alternative clients and                                 boats the interesting thing that                                 administrators could help us to detect                                 errors mistakes between in                                 synchronization with OpenStreetMap and                                 or and the text strange activity also                                 they could raise a red flag if the data                                 becomes inconsistent basically every                                 active user that does a little bit                                 investigation is an administrator and                                 that's what we want to have it very                                 simple and the third channel is                                 analytics is a kind of role as it's very                                 similar to administrator but has a                                 longer horizon to view and analytics                                 could analyze and predict data                                 consistency choosing the right data                                 format to store it and basically write                                 articles to explain to other people what                                 is important or not and that's pretty                                 much it thank you                                 [Applause]                                 here sink Balad Victor or of the talk                                 are there any questions                                 hi do you think that you can operate                                 such a system without review really on                                 the reviews because I think also for                                 Google there is a lot of fakes and spam                                 and harassment in the database so I                                 think think you need lots of manpower to                                 keep it clean service avi self-wringing                                 no I think well it's a tricky question                                 of course how do we deal with spam                                 bother                                 I know people deal with kind of                                 violations in OpenStreetMap and people                                 draw some harassment zones on the map so                                 of course we can think about it to not                                 enter that world but on the other hand                                 if people need it for some kind of                                 aggregation and if we can at least says                                 that                                                                   it's easier to throw away the data                                 component for example to map date which                                 is interlinked here you just forget                                 about                                                                doesn't break computability Vizard data                                 for example if we are talking about                                 reviews of photos because if                                             and later on not now but for example in                                 the months we can detect what is good or                                 bad                                 that's I think a win situation one that                                 one benefit that we have in                                 OpenStreetMap sometimes and here I                                 believe as well that we shouldn't detect                                 we shouldn't kind of detect it                                 momentarily but over time the violations                                 become very clear so immediately you can                                 miss it but over time you can track it                                 down similar what's happens with                                 Wikipedia and try to clean it it will                                 never be perfect but                                                   enough hey awesome idea I really                                 appreciate it                                 one question if how do you handle                                 changing permanent IDs or changing IDs                                 from OpenStreetMap because as far as I                                 understand it if someone attacks a                                 restaurant as a note and then someone                                 else comes along deletes that note that                                 makes a relation out of it that had for                                 example represents a house how does it                                 how does your project so indeed very                                 interesting present question because I                                 missed it in my presentation but love to                                 answer so indeed it was a main problem                                 we deal with so for example we could                                 use IDs from OpenStreetMap to associate                                 reviews but that that's a big problem                                 there is no permanent ID so of course                                 that's projects one of the main tasks                                 and that what we already did to assign                                 new IDs permanent IDs that they consist                                 of two parts one is just random and                                 another encodes big radius of location                                 but the main thing is to maintain it in                                 sync with OpenStreetMap and what we                                 figured out that location is not even                                 the main problem the main problem is the                                 name                                 so for example when you when new place                                 is open at the same place usually people                                 just share the same node but it's                                 completely different place sometimes                                 names change a little bit and then it's                                 still the same people could understand                                 it but sometimes name changed a lot and                                 it's clearly new place and we can we did                                 some automation but that's exactly what                                 administrators or we need to think about                                 how to work with it we cannot expect osm                                 will track the edges but what we can do                                 over time we have a possibility to merge                                 for example if in the month we realized                                 okay that was the same place that they                                 were there is a functionality to merge                                 back and basically to build up the whole                                 history nicely so and that's a core idea                                 we need to work get working first to                                 maintain at least                                                    permanent ID and permanent ID is not                                 just location it's a kind of logical                                 thing it's kind of a legal thing as well                                 and sometimes                                 you said that blockchain can clearly use                                 or you don't want to use proof of work                                 and your mentioned proof of stake what                                 are you now actually using therefore                                 this database like blockchain so for our                                 open place reviews we are not going to                                 use any kind of consensus in the                                 beginning so it will be one central                                 server for simplification but we                                 selected some algorithm strings to great                                 later proof of work doesn't help and                                 doesn't work but there is a                                 decentralized crews of stake when main                                 kind of servers which create blocks are                                 selected based on voting we are not                                 going to write that but we are going to                                 reuse existing algorithms and and of                                 course first servers will be associated                                 with we think with the companies with                                 all these people names that we know for                                 example we can trust that person it's                                 not like we don't know each other we                                 meet in the conference and we know who                                 for example what most month was Maps me                                 what other projects and if we associate                                 people with the beginning I think it                                 could work fine but as a prototype we                                 are not working on consensus part yet we                                 have working mostly on API and storing                                 information                                 now that sounds much more like a key                                 signing scheme than a blockchain or am I                                 mistaken so it still follows a                                 blockchain as a database definition                                 because it produces blocks they are                                 replicated across multiple devices just                                 as there are roles in a blockchain there                                 is a concept of role who can produce a                                 block and so far it is in code is that                                 role is assigned only to one server of                                 course later on it will be assigned to                                 many and then they will need to build                                 that consensus but that consensus yeah                                 it's it's simpler to follow to that                                 decentralized rules of stake consensus                                 which is implemented already in some                                 routines so thank you again Victor for                                 the talk and                                 all the best for your project
