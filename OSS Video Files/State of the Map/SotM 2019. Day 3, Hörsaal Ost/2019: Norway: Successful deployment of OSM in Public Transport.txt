Title: 2019: Norway: Successful deployment of OSM in Public Transport
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019. Day 3, Hörsaal Ost
Description: 
	Norway has deployed OSM on a national level for journey planning and is taking initiatives to expand the user, and usage of OSM in Norway and abroad.

Entur’s mission is to enable and increase the use of public transport in Norway. Entur operates the national registry for all public transport in Norway, collecting data from 60 public transportation operators. The registry contains data about 21,000 daily departures on 3,000 routes. This data is open and free of use for app and service developers.

We would very much like to present our success story of using OSM data as the foundation for all interchanges and routing in our national journey planner (used in the app: Entur, and http://en-tur.no), and the surprisingly easy challenges we faced due to the quality of OSM data, and the way we solved the large scale challenges, such as missing roads around the country. Why we are going to continue to build on the usage of OSM, OpenTripPlanner and other open source platforms on a European wide base to create an ever-improving public transport information distribution.

We are actively engaging with the Norwegian community to build relations, improve quality and mapping methods, even arranging beer meetups.

We are of course providing all our data openly, making it easy for OSM to make good use of for example our national stop place database, or for our NeTEx based time table data to be used in innovative solutions.

	                              good afternoon and welcome everybody                               I am TD we are going to have a talk by                               your Hannon Wicklund                               it's going to be on no way successful                               deployment of open data in public                               transport it's going to be a                                          talk and five minutes for questions                               thank you so the the program says or                               some but I want to change it to open                                data because it's more than that it's                                not just OSM so I'm from I'm from Sweden                                but I work in Norway and this is my                                company name it's pronounced intoed                                means a trip or a journey or something                                sir add the identity come back came up                                with it so here we can see the wrong                                point and my name you want victim Data                                Manager and OpenStreetMap guy so I do                                all the mapping no one else understands                                but mapping is before we start with the                                real things I want to do a little bit of                                backstory because in order we have a                                long tradition of collecting all                                timetabled public transport information                                in one place you can see on the side                                here this is the first edition from                                     it had all the steamboat boats and                                trains or almost anyway and the text up                                there actually says I wish we had more                                which is exactly what we say now and in                                                                                                 database and cd-rom version and stuff                                for that                                                               journey planner online and                                         company was created out of a split and                                merge kind of thing which I won't get                                into now but the goals of this new                                organization which is into it is to                                promote support public transportation                                and to do it in an open way this is                                requirement from the government that you                                wanted this by the way this is the                                right-wing government I'm just gonna get                                into it so first of all what do we do in                                OpenStreetMap we invest quite a lot in                                pre-emptive mapping so we don't know                                what's where the problems are but we can                                see that there might be problems in the                                future                                so we have done almost six million edits                                already and situation in Norway is that                                we have open data government which is                                actively promoting opening datasets for                                public use this includes the orthophotos                                you can see a picture here there's a guy                                kicking a football into a goal this is                                way up in the north not in the city and                                this of course we use along with this is                                not think we have road network as well                                we can import that from the national                                survey company and of course if you                                combine that with perfect aerial photos                                which are highly rectified you can                                create sort of permanent mapping of                                roads you don't need to go back and fix                                it again of course the pre-emptive                                mapping means that we don't actually                                experience that many problems from the                                public there's rapidity as well from us                                because any time get a reaction we can                                of course instantly edit it and as you                                can see it says we are running straight                                of the nightly export from Gear fabric                                we are not afraid to use it right away                                you know snapshots and in terms of                                a bit last year yeah so we have for                                example here's a visualization which we                                use for VMT mapping this is it measures                                routing distance versus air distance and                                I just used map CSS to visualize it red                                and green you know good and bad I want                                to get to the problems we have with OSM                                first of all complex areas which is                                actually being discussed right now in                                large room by the French from Paris and                                it has to do with how do you walk across                                this complex area you can see if you                                know the carto you can see that this                                highway pedestrian area which is very                                complex and you need a algorithm to sort                                of route across that and you have the                                levels and everything and of course a                                lot of problem is when you have you want                                to wait like how is a path in terms of                                quality for a pedestrian who wants to                                take a bus and then you have in Oslo you                                might have a different situation from                                far up in the north so it's difficult to                                map it in the same way I think be easy                                 to make a routing engine for a city                                 because you can map the whole city in a                                 single way but if you have a huge                                 country with huge differences in climate                                 even this is going to be a problem                                 discouraging routing on roads is not a                                 problem we have how do you get this                                 routing to not go into the intersection                                 and start using the pedestrian paths or                                 sidewalks instead it's a problem and of                                 course the layers when we use OTP right                                 now it just puts the coordinates and he                                 doesn't know which level the person is                                 on or the stop and this is we had talked                                 just earlier today in the small room                                 about tagging and we kind of see that                                 there is oh wait sorry doesn't match so                                 when you have our SEM with kind of free                                 tagging and you suggest you mailing                                 lists and stuff it creates this                                 flexibility but it also creates the                                 problem that there is a bit it's                                 difficult to find proper documentation                                 in a single place                                 it's kind of uneven difficult to find or                                 rely on this is a problem for us as a                                 company because you know you can sort of                                 awry rely on it up to a certain point                                 but in the last sort of                                            quality you need it kind of force falls                                 short because of the differences in                                 variations and such so we would like to                                 see a more organized effort from osm to                                 make proper documentation and Moore's                                 singular mapping standards so I want to                                 talk about what my company does as a                                 whole the bigger picture so we have a                                 self-service point for all public                                 transport operators in Norway they are                                 required by the government to deliver                                 their data into this input along with                                 real-time feeds and then of course we                                 had our SEM there this is done we use                                 mainly in ethics but we also use GTFS                                 now as this will back up then it's                                 packaged and then it comes out at the                                 other end as api's and data dumps and                                 they turn around for this is about one                                 hour the whole thing which we are part                                 of one big part of this package we have                                 is this stop point this is top places                                 which is a single point stop place                                 database which which is administered by                                 these local governments were also                                 responsible for uploading data we have                                 one database so that we can avoid                                 duplicates                                 and so that for example a new user new                                 company can simply find their stops that                                 I have to map out their own stops just                                 go to the database these are our stops                                 and the stop is database is also using                                 the orthophotos I talked about before so                                 when we map the stops we also use the                                 same backdrop to map our SEM so it's                                 always in synchronization it's also                                 available as an API so there's a link                                 there you can get my presentation later                                 and you can click it and it's a graph QL                                 script or API and yes all the stops are                                 currently being automatically imported                                 into SM by a user it's an automatic                                 script and it synchronizes our Sam with                                 our stops this is the interface for the                                 the user interface for the rest of place                                 registry so you can see in enter                                 facilities and names and the red things                                 are the exact stop positions which are                                 underneath a sort of lay collecting                                 point like stop place the second part of                                 our system that one wanted up but is                                 open trip planner because we have we                                 started using up a trip planner based on                                 what they did in Finland did you transit                                 so we built on their branch and now we                                 are also building a coat EP                                           has an ethics import so input support                                 and the new search algorithm which is                                 faster boots because Norway is too big                                 to use the old one and there's some                                 links there too you can click on later                                 so I want to talk about why this is good                                 for Norway because of course it's not                                 cheap to have developers working on this                                 building new                                 tools and it's like a huge investment                                 for the government but this is kind of                                 absorbed later on because what we see                                 now is that the more and more of the                                 major operators in Norway are starting                                 to build their systems on top of our API                                 instead of building their own systems                                 so we unify the whole thing and of                                 course that saves a lot of money as a                                 whole                                 yes we are currently handing out                                     million search results per month                                     million and this is rising you can see                                 this actually graph back here and I made                                 fictitious but it's it is growing and                                 the more you see like you have that we                                 have the biggest one right now at the                                 Oslo region they're using it and you can                                 see more agents like Bergen are starting                                 to build and it's gonna snowball get                                 bigger so when I said it's open data I                                 wanted to make a little point here it                                 actually means that the api's are                                 completely free to use anyone here                                 go to our website find the link and                                 build your own search engine right now                                 the only thing require is like a header                                 so you know whether it's not a random                                 thing and as well as the open data you                                 can just go and get our GTFS data                                 anywhere anytime I mean everything                                 almost everything we have in the middle                                 box there is open source so anyone here                                 is free to copy our systems use our                                 front-end backends almost anything                                 and we use open formats so it's netic                                 smiley but we also have GTF at each of                                 us and this creates for us the this                                 virtuous circle so the more you publish                                 data the more access accessible it is so                                 it's visible so you get more incentive                                 to increase the quality and the content                                 amount and I'm pretty much done here so                                 I wanted to say I've talked to a lot of                                 people here I've seen and recognized                                 most people and we would love for to                                 have more collaborate collaborators on                                 our development more users for our data                                 and yeah or just copy our stuff and do                                 it one thing it's fine as well and                                 that's it for me for now                                 [Applause]                                 also shout out to people back home in                                 Norway I know you're watching thank you                                 very much your hand for the up                                 enlightening talk                                 and we would like to have questions yes                                 as many as we can what you why we do the                                 questions I can you say that my slide                                 also has all these links at the end you                                 can just click things yes thank you for                                 your presentation we have actually next                                 talk also related to public transport                                 and my question is I understand you have                                 an open API kind of free to use and you                                 have and you published etfs data but for                                 example we are mostly interested in our                                 topic will be about offline routers so                                 my question is do you publish data which                                 has links between GTFS and osm relation                                 ages so it could be built in I don't                                 think we have any or some edge                                 information in the data as such no it's                                 just it builds to a graphic routing                                 graph and it's all inside OTP but                                 internally you use that map in somehow                                 because you use as I understand yes we                                 use Open Street Map for Rob do you have                                 this information but it's just not yeah                                 I don't think it comes out anywhere now                                 how do you think but it probably could                                 you mentioned your data processing is                                 for the open source                                 have you seen cases of parallel use                                 other users of your code for the same                                 sort of processing or is the main                                 benefit of open sourcing it the                                 transparency the UM for reuse or is                                 transparency must leave a goal of                                 publishing that code I think it's both                                 we want to have more contributors and we                                 want it to be transparent as well so                                 well if you use it separately and we                                 don't know about it then I guess it's no                                 benefit for us but if you contribute if                                 you see problems and you point it out to                                 us or whatever you know that's a good                                 thing we don't have any negative                                 feelings about using open source stuff                                 it is positive sorry                                 and since you publish the output already                                 all all the outputs are to make all the                                 API a public why would anyone replicate                                 the same system to publish the same                                 outputs I can't answer that                                 have you seen examples of other users                                 running it just to know if someone else                                 in Norway runs it also in Norway                                 nowadays the base their systems on our                                 API so they don't use our system so it's                                 mostly a transparency thing so that                                 everyone can see how it's produced okay                                 no I was just wondering why isn't                                 everyone doing this I mean yeah me too                                 okay questions comments anyone anyway                                 I'm gonna be out here some I think I'm                                 gonna listen to you next I'm gonna                                 listen to you talk but I'm gonna be                                 outside afterwards okay and I have an                                 announcement to make that please before                                 you go remember to leave the name tag
