	                              so welcome everybody to the lightning                               talk session here at Sutton                                            poor speaker and we'll hear about                               postboxes addresses osm inspector and                               about bus lines so we start with SK                                  and hear about postboxes okay                               my name's Gerry Clough best known as SK                                                                                                 about postboxes but it's really about                                tagging we're here we're here every few                                weeks or every few months on the mailing                                lists tagging is broken it needs to be                                replaced by a formal model I thought I'd                                just look at those implications by                                looking at one of the most mundane                                things we map a simple bit of street                                furniture the postbox also happens to be                                a sort of cultural meme in osm that we                                mapped post boxes and the first thing to                                say when we look when we say Amina T                                equals closed box we're already modeling                                concepts we're talking about two things                                we're talking about a physical lump of                                metal stuck in a place on the street the                                item of street furniture and we're                                talking about a service where a postal                                company comes and takes your the letters                                you put in the post box I won't touch on                                the fact that also many languages the                                word for post box is the same as the                                word we use for the place where the                                Postal Service sent gives you letters                                this post box is interesting because                                it's the only way we map the physical                                post box is when we say it's a disused :                                and mean a T equals post box like this                                one which also happens to be very                                interesting because it was attacked by                                suffragettes in about                                                  the votes for women so it turns out post                                boxes have and there's an interesting                                history of post box violence and that                                isn't the first example                                the the main thing the main thing we I                                think the way we are using postboxes is                                as the service and really we know where                                the postbox is that's the most important                                thing and maybe the collection times are                                useful to add most in most things you                                have a cultural idea of when the post                                comes to collect you know it used to be                                                                                                        Britain but now it's usually                                          in the morning so so the next kind of                                tagging is describing what kind of post                                box and typically we have three kinds of                                post boxes and here I've got a Polish                                water lamp box attached to a wall a wall                                box which is mounted in the wall so it's                                not you only have a plate and a German                                pillar box if we look at the post box as                                a whole this is the typical anatomy of a                                British post box and there's a little                                thing here saying when the next                                collection time is which we I don't                                think any more maps where that exists                                there you have below we have the hole                                where you put the letters and I don't                                know if you know but some letterboxes                                post boxes have more than one hole so                                you can say post box apertures equals                                two beneath that you have the collection                                plate where but first of all we have all                                the information which we put into the                                opening times and anyone who's looked at                                the opening to the collector the opening                                times specification understands that                                it's a really complex semi formal                                specification with lots of holes and                                then a couple of things which you notice                                on British post boxes beneath that you                                will see a crown and beneath that the                                initials of the Queen which is the royal                                cypher and beneath that it says                                post-office and most postal companies                                will have some kind of logo associated a                                post box I don't know if it's visible on                                this one but also sometimes these are if                                these are made a cast metal they have                                the name of the manufacturer and we can                                tell                                postbox on : manufacturer equals so we                                can get a bit more complicated there are                                hundreds of different designs of pillar                                boxes so we can save post box : design                                equals so and these are I'm afraid of                                very this very UK centric but I'm sure                                you recognize that some of the same                                issues existed in other countries royal                                 ciphers we have a range of six or all                                 ciphers available this is the royal                                 cypher of Edward the eighth which                                 because he was the King for only eight                                 months is very rare and therefore a very                                 select and dedicated people go and do                                 these thing and you can read more about                                 these on the wiki but queen elizabeth ii                                 is only the queen at number two Queen                                 Elizabeth in England Wales and Northern                                 Ireland

post boxes                                 with a to are on and you can read more                                 about that on the pillar box boy war                                 page on Wikipedia

different from the crown we saw on                                 the previous one which is the imperial                                 crown on to the post box is it just a

                      that with a formal method we'd be                                 talking about orders of magnitude                                 complexity of stuff we could never                                 verify its tagging isn't broke don't fix                                 it                                 thank you so I click here too okay so my                                 name is ching-he                                 I'm French but I've been for in Brazil                                 for more than                                                        Britta to to up and hit map with TeleNav                                 when I was the country manager for                                 TeleNav in Brazil and when they told me                                 hey try to do with to see what you can                                 do for the community in Brazil I didn't                                 I did do they didn't do much mapping but                                 I started doing what I was used to do is                                 to get in contact with people and that                                 was in                                                                  had I've had quite many meetings with                                 many different people in Brazil                                 particularly in governments the                                 government's even published an official                                 notes recommending the use of                                 OpenStreetMap to Brazilian governments                                 in general and among all these contacts                                 that I've had I always speak in my                                 presentation at one moment I always                                 speak about really who is also from                                 Brazil but who is developed the new SME                                 shop and in                                                              from Christian quest who is not here                                 anymore today because he left yesterday                                 was with us and I was very much                                 impressed by what he managed to do in                                 France and he said to the Ministry of                                 to the Ministry of Finance hey we                                 OpenStreetMap have got a set of                                 addresses you've got another one which                                 is very good nasty to geography Nacional                                 has got another one and the post office                                 has got four different ones and many                                 people are sending addresses here in                                 France why don't we put all our efforts                                 together in one place and after a while                                 in fact he managed to he managed to do                                 that because if there was a very                                 interesting fights a kind of a fight or                                 a problem because between the IGN in                                 this project because his project was                                 kind of an open project and finally it                                 seems that the First Minister created                                 I'm not having to censure this story but                                 the First Minister created little AB                                 which were which is we still is which is                                 still an entity that works for                                 digitalization of the government in                                 France and they invited him to                                 coordinate this project from inside from                                 the government side and I found it very                                 interesting so there is a website that                                 exists in France which is at rest that                                 data.gov dot if FR and they are working                                 on congregating and bringing together                                 all these different data sets of                                 addresses focused on our addresses from                                 municipalities utility players etc and                                 it's a project which is going on                                 reasonably well although Christian quest                                 and I just left it recently but there is                                 someone that there are some other people                                 there taking care of the project and                                 it's a very cheap project such it's a                                 project that could be done with about                                 two or three people and that's all                                 because it basically it's a database and                                 where you need to invite people to to                                 communicate and to give data etc so I've                                 tried to do that in Brazil and I'm                                 proposing with all these meetings among                                 these pictures that I've shown before of                                 meetings that I had I had meetings with                                 people from the digital secretary of the                                 digital government in Brazil with the                                 IBGE which is the the                                 the entity that is doing geography and                                 maps in Brazil I've spoken with the                                 Brazilian association of logistics                                 etcetera and what I'm explaining to them                                 is that Brazil has got no address or no                                 good set of addresses in in                                 OpenStreetMap the best player is                                 probably googled today after here and                                 TomTom but geocoding in Brazil is very                                 is an actual challenge when you get out                                 of the big towns and it's an enormous                                 opportunity for the country to improve                                 its logistics and I tell them hey every                                 time I speak with someone who has got                                 for example a fleet how many want a                                 fleet for example how in how much would                                 you improve your your your your                                 logistics and your operation if you had                                 a good set of addresses and the guys say                                 well I don't know at this                                           happens that Brazil spends something                                 like                                                                product in on logistics so the potential                                 of having just a database is enormous in                                 terms of improvement of the of the                                 functioning of the country so I'm trying                                 to evolve and and it seems to me that as                                 I've worked on this and the last month                                 more more precisely it seems to me them                                 about to manage to do it and I think                                 that it's very interesting for as a                                 conclusion I think this project in                                 France is amazingly interesting it's                                 very interesting if we manage to do it                                 in Brazil and I think it would be very                                 interesting to know event or eventually                                 other places in the world interesting                                 trying to work on that or where people                                 would have already done that                                 so I'm interested in instead of only                                 speaking about France to speak                                 eventually over other places was where                                 similar things things have been done                                 okay so thank you very much                                 so next person is Makana Miculek I shot                                 and he will tell us news about osm                                 inspector let's see                                 put away this google at attention please                                 ladies yours mechana hello i'm i'm                                 nikana from sheer fabric i am currently                                 the main developer of our web inspector                                 and i would like to show you some news                                 about a stream of inspector in the last                                 couple of months we if we Whitten the                                 routing few the ordering field was                                 previously based of a couple of backend                                 programs                                 it used over sir m to detect routing                                 island sinks and sources and a java                                 program by pascal nice to find                                 unconnected nodes if we wit in this part                                 and now use quaffable based software to                                 find unconnected nodes                                 routing islands and applicated edges                                 this is Heidelberg it looks quite pet                                 but a lots of the mouth for supplicates                                 and i would like to show you some of the                                 layers as a first step there is the                                 group duplicated edges to duplicate i                                 just group con distinguishes between                                 real duplicated edges and those which                                 are just for likely false positives near                                 pedestrian areas let's have a look at                                 this one click on it and then you have a                                 pattern where you can open it in                                 Trussell                                 and let's have a look it seems that our                                 two at two ways above each other and I                                 can have a look at the differences and                                 it seems that someone has                                               above the other one so the solution                                 would usually be to delete to delete one                                 of them sometimes this is an accident of                                 splitting ways so that would be the                                 solution and it looks fine let's have a                                 look at the next layer group islands                                 islands are locations and on the                                 autograph which are not connected to the                                 rest of the graph while drinking engines                                 are usually able to eliminate them                                 before they join the processing but they                                 are usually a sign of somehow broken                                 data for example let's have a look at                                 this one it's black this means that this                                 is an outing island for all vehicles not                                 only cars and bicycles the car and                                 bicycle layers take excess restrictions                                 into account while all vehicle layers                                 layer doesn't this is which over a vote                                 and it's not connected anywhere and it's                                 in private way the best solution would                                 be to visit the location and try to                                 connect it to the road network that's                                 something you can't usually to us aerial                                 imagery only miss earth who both layers                                 are unconnected notes the column means                                 dakara is an indicator of the importance                                 of the error what is will a real issue                                 why blue is often a false positive this                                 ranking takes the distance into account                                 and it takes into account whether there                                 are texts like no exit equals yes or                                 entrance equals yes at the end note and                                 it will discard all unconnected ends                                 well the next way is beyond a fence or                                 embankment of all which you cannot pass                                 for example this ello he                                 is of medium priority and it's a left                                 over of incomplete sidewalk mapping it's                                 likely that these sidewalks are should                                 be connected to the router or just                                 ending here and the best solution would                                 be to press a and connect them thank you                                 for your attention so we are talking                                 about quickly mapping bus lines and how                                 it works with counting tools can you                                 hear me now yes so I'm sorry my                                 handwriting is terrible it's with                                 routing tools                                 yeah well would you count and I realize                                 I'm the last one standing between us and                                 lunch so I'll be very quick hopefully we                                 can still get something today                                 and how'd you do this a view and                                 [Music]                                 full-screen mode that looks good                                 so I've I've mapped a couple of best                                 lines with the PT v                                                   who've done it it takes a long time you                                 have to put every way in the thing and                                 it breaks often people create gaps and                                 by mistake and so it's a fragile complex                                 schema                                 all right I've done is I put a tool that                                 where you copy/paste from a relation you                                 put all the stop positions of a line you                                 just have to gather those in the right                                 order and then you click on that on that                                 button and it opens up Oh SRM where the                                 bus profile so it does all the all the                                 way that the bus would take if there's a                                 mistake you could grab the line and drag                                 it along to the to where the bus is                                 supposed to run and it also lets you                                 know where it also lets you detect when                                 that when the tagging or like a one-way                                 bus is is missing so you can improve it                                 or SM and then for those who have very                                 good eyes you see at the bottom left but                                 i I've I've zoomed in for you I've                                 created a button that says create                                 relation in Jassim and when you do that                                 in the background                                 it takes so oh s RM doesn't return away                                 ideas but it returns nodes so it takes                                 all those nodes IDs and then it using                                 the matte box routes annotator it gets                                 the way IDs from that so if you're going                                 through node                                                             going through that way and it takes all                                 of those ways and tells Jotham to fetch                                 them from overpass and to create a                                 relation containing all those ways and                                 you get this which is in a few minutes                                 you've made a whole bus relation                                 containing all the ways that the bus is                                 going to go through it's not perfect                                 I've taken a screenshot showing how it's                                 not                                 it has a gap at the bottom but then you                                 would just use the PTO system tools to                                 fix the gaps half automatically or you'd                                 fix it manually because it doesn't take                                 a lot of time and you would add the                                 tagging and you would paste the stops                                 into that relation and that's it you                                 have your PT v                                                        doing that I thought you know why are we                                 even entering though all the ways into                                 OSM because what we can define a bus                                 route as is stops and also the via                                 points that sometimes you would have to                                 take the special cases but most of the                                 time the stops are enough so I'm                                 thinking of making a proposal and this                                 is to get everyone screaming at me no                                 this is not a good idea of redefining                                 bus lines as just the stops and violence                                 next step are also with this matching I                                 could also do you know often you get                                 open to open data from oh there's a                                 hiking route and you take that and with                                 this you can turn it into the ways and                                 build a relation like that far more                                 easily than adding every single way and                                 awesome or cycling as well route                                 relations in general thank you                                 you
