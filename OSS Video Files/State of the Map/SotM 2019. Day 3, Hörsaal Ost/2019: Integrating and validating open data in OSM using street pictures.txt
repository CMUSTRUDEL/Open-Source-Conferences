Title: 2019: Integrating and validating open data in OSM using street pictures
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019. Day 3, HÃ¶rsaal Ost
Description: 
	Pic4Review now helps contributors to integrate open data properly in OpenStreetMap using street pictures validation. Discover the way it works and how this can help improve both OSM and open datasets.

[Pic4Review](http://pic4review.pavie.info/) is a new editor to work on OpenStreetMap using open street-level pictures offered by Mapillary, OpenStreetCam and Wikimedia Commons. You can create thematic missions to work on a specific subject. The features are loaded in the tool, which automatically find available pictures around it, and offers a simple interface to answer questions and editing the features.

At start, it was helping contributors adding details on existing objects, like accessibility of crossings, name of shops, levels of buildings... This offers a wide range of possibilities, and was already used by hundreds of contributors to edit around 100000 features worldwide. Now, it also offers to integrate open datasets into OpenStreetMap, the proper way. The complexity of integrating open data in OSM lies in the accuracy of these datasets : we should check if features are correctly located, and properly described. This can be done by surveying, or using freely available pictures of our streets. This is what Pic4Review offers to simplify : import your dataset, create a mission, and work in team to integrate the data which can be verified.

This talk will present the problem of open data integration, the Pic4Review tool, and the process of using it for integrating open data.

	                              welcome everybody here at the third day                               at swattin                                                             utterly impervious avi avi sari which                               means that from France and he will talk                               about integrating and validating open                               data and also SME using street pictures                               so let's see what he will tell us thank                               you and hi everyone can you hear me                               correctly yeah so easy yeah aware of                                what is open data is it clear for you                                what is open data or not what do you                                know you will knows about open data                                okay so mostly everyone so I will be                                brief on that open data is a data which                                is a geographical or no geographical                                which can be opened by city councils                                by governments by some societies and the                                idea is that you can use it for ANOVA                                use the purpose is to make to make this                                data be reusable by over-over people in                                open data you have some sometimes very                                qualitative data like a good quality                                very exhaustive very detail and                                sometimes you have more or less trash                                you have things missing you have no                                information in the intimated metadata so                                it's quite true and we have to do some                                some sort of what is good and what is                                not good so it's quite complicated to                                use sometimes as we confirm in                                OpenStreetMap we have a very rich                                attribute model and most of the time the                                point of interest we aiways                                are very detailed so we go very deep in                                the detail but there is no ground he on                                exhaust ability even if most of the time                                the mapping is quite exhaustive nobody's                                is you have to say ok we'll map is                                complete it's not something we do                                because it's a open source project and                                it's                                by people contributing on their freetime                                must be so we have no grounds the data                                is where but we are not sure it's                                complete and last thing we have straight                                pictures so you might be aware of what                                straight pictures are these are pictures                                which are taken by people in the streets                                which channels are located and hosted on                                project like open sweet cam like map in                                re or Wikimedia Commons and the idea is                                that on the picture you can see many                                details you can see as good as if you                                were there so it's very interesting as                                as a data source to use this kind of                                pictures so we have on some part open                                data which can be rich which can be pro                                depending of the source of the data we                                have Open Street Map which is very rich                                in information but we are not sure it                                can be complete and we have a straight                                picture which here which are having many                                details and can be a source to confirm                                if something is there and to describe it                                moreover so how can we combine all these                                data to make the best data source                                possible in OpenStreetMap well we would                                like to do something like that maybe say                                ok well community is working on its city                                and wants to improve for example the                                tagging of a bus stop so we would like                                to review each boost up having the                                strictness sweet pictures around and                                having a simple tool to show it on the                                web on a website so people can say ok                                this moustakas name that data and it is                                accessible in will share and so on so                                the idea was to was to make this simple                                in order to improve upon sweet map and                                so it's mostly what dig for of you do so                                you can access it on the on the web it's                                online and you can have access also to a                                source code it's open source and so and                                so it works that way it's a mostly a                                website when you have mission so                                you can start a mission in your city and                                say okay I want to improve will share                                description on crossing I want to add                                the kind of bicycle parking you can do                                pretty any kind of mission as long as                                you have a bit of information in                                OpenStreetMap                                on an open data source and then some                                street pictures in your city otherwise                                it won't work out so if I select one                                mission for example with crossings using                                wheelchair I have this kind of user                                interface where I can see on the left we                                have a feature I'm reviewing is located                                 by example if this is a crossing and on                                 the right I have all the street pictures                                 available around so it's only the                                 pictures which are looking directly at                                 the feature so that way you only have                                 interesting pictures and then you can                                 review and on this kind of on this                                 crossing for example we see just where                                 that there is a possibility to pass by                                 wheelchair but maybe not on the other                                 side so in that case I will say ok it's                                 only one side which is accessible and                                 when I click on this answer this                                 information is directly sent to the                                 OpenStreetMap data base and you have                                 contributed without even knowing what is                                 a tag what is a feature with what is                                 node and so on it's very simple you can                                 put you can make beginners using this                                 and they will do the job                                 so it's also working on mobile phone so                                 if you want so if you want to contribute                                 on your mobile phone is it also possible                                 so it's very responsive so you have                                 existing mission but you can create your                                 own mission if you want to start                                 something on your city so where is this                                 template system which was to create some                                 mission based on existing models so you                                 have like                                                               I can make more if necessary and you                                 will then just choose area you want to                                 create the mission on and you're ready                                 to go                                 tool will process with data and make it                                 available as a mission so you can start                                 reviewing you can also create own nation                                 from scratch if you want to make                                 something highly configure so where you                                 can choose one of the data source you                                 want to use it if you want to use for                                 example                                 Osmos detection so we quality insurance                                 tour so if you want to use overpass for                                 example now if you want to use mapillary                                 detection so you might be aware that an                                 applet every can detect on its picture                                 if there is for example a fire you want                                 and say ok probably is a fire I don't on                                 this place but we want to be sure but it                                 is there before importing in                                 OpenStreetMap so when you can add some                                 details on the mission and configure our                                 people should answer the simple question                                 so it's quite a bit more complicated but                                 it shows advanced user to create their                                 own mission varies Mamie to contributing                                 model on this tour so complete existing                                 OpenStreetMap data so we take data from                                 overpass and we say ok I want to add                                 this kind of information which                                 accessibility issue whatever or we can                                 import open data so we make we take                                 information from a city council or                                 government I want to import into Open                                 Street Map but not in bulk we want to                                 import feature by feature to be sure                                 that we are not importing something                                 which doesn't exist in reality so the                                 data sources from this now are mainly                                 the open data which is available from                                 the Osmo store so we are was another                                 presentation of Osmos during the event                                 so we can have a look at it many what it                                 does is that it takes the open data it                                 looks at the OpenStreetMap data and say                                 ok this one is missing this one is                                 already on the database and can be                                 completed and it's making you know                                 compression and we can use mapillary                                 feature detection so like                                 detection of streetlights detection of                                 benches and so on so many example of                                 what can be added for this tool so                                 street light traffic signs power station                                 those bugs mostly every kind of point of                                 in the interest can be added this way so                                 it's made to be very easy and I will                                 present you or live demonstration of                                 this so we are using some open data set                                 in France which is a describing the                                 power substation so it's a technical                                 team in the power power grid and where                                 we have probably a power substation yeah                                 and in the picture I can see there this                                 little white building it's a very                                 characteristic in France so I know there                                 is a power substation at this place and                                 if I want to correct a bit the position                                 you know it looks quite exact for                                 example I can move it a bit like that                                 and directly import the data and say ok                                 the future is there I have adjusted its                                 position and now it's in OpenStreetMap                                 so it's very simple you can do it in                                 like thousand of this during our so it's                                 very simple you know for example I can't                                 see one so I will say ok I can't see it                                 so I'm not sure I will not import I just                                 keep and then you do it for every every                                 object and you can add thousand of them                                 quite easily so if you if we look back a                                 state at a statistics we project was                                 around for more than one year no and we                                 are like                                                               already used it and they are added like                                 hundred of thousand object and for                                 example we have                                                          have been added in the world we have                                 more than eleven thousand of pedestrian                                 crossings which have been improving the                                 description so mostly                                 saying if they are accessible in                                 wheelchair and we have like                                            substation in front so it's not bad bad                                 so the tool is already doing a lot of                                 things but we want to go further because                                 as you see we have only two named data                                 sources for now we have to add the open                                 data in Ausmus first if we want to use                                 it in the picture review tool so maybe                                 when one idea of a future will be to                                 extend it to all open that asset like                                 you can import your work your CSV file                                 or George is on file and then generally                                 create a mission and but there will be                                 some difficulties if we do that because                                 every data source has different                                 attributes if out naming and we have to                                 make it understandable by the OSM                                 tagging system so how do we do how do we                                 combat this data set into something less                                 incompatible so maybe we can use the                                 Semantic Web which is something doing                                 which has been around for a long time                                 but not used yet for this kind of                                 application or maybe you can also think                                 of exporting directly from open data                                 portals into XML or SM format so that                                 would be easier to use so very thing to                                 do around this subject we can also try                                 to make the data even before it is                                 published so we can ALPA maybe city                                 councils or governments to make their                                 data cleaner as before we publish it so                                 maybe they could use it for review                                 internally to make the data more                                 described and more qualitative and maybe                                 we can also stop result of the                                 contribution in people for review in                                 some cross databases so we can use it                                 internally try to do the world process                                 by themself and then later publish it                                 and so big file view is a open source                                 project so you can still help us to make                                 it even better the main things we are                                 looking for translation                                 we have like eight from wages for now I                                 think there is a French English Japanese                                 maybe Chinese also a countryman eight of                                 them and so if you have if you want to                                 make it available in your own language                                 you can start translating I'm also                                 pleased to have always a the user                                 feedback to make it better so if you use                                 it and find something like he or some                                 bug don't hesitate to contact me and                                 then I also do some development work to                                 make the new features available and the                                 bug fixing so yeah you can participate                                 and it will help make the tool better so                                 as a conclusion                                 this tool is quite simple but makes as                                 possible to take the best of the open                                 data and open sweet map so we have                                 quality of OpenStreetMap and exhaust                                 ility of open data set pictures make the                                 data there is a variable because we are                                 sure that the information is there we                                 have a date survey date so things are                                 quite clear of where the information is                                 coming from and I hope this is the start                                 of amazing that I Johnny so just a                                 little confusion before before yen                                 quality is never an accident it is                                 always the result of intelligent effort                                 it's a quotation from John Ruskin which                                 is a writer and beta thank you                                 [Applause]                                 [Applause]                                 for your great talk and the introduction                                 are there any questions in the audience                                 I really liked the idea of having a                                 mission in order to improve data and do                                 you think it would be possible to do the                                 same without a picture but live to go to                                 check if somebody was wrong to make like                                 a lab it because it looks like a game                                 and do you think we could extend it in                                 other ways to improve the awesome data                                 yeah I think it's possible but maybe                                 it's not big for view which will be the                                 best tool for this because we are                                 already application doing run survey x                                  it completely like osm own in some in                                 some way so we are already existing                                 application doing this as it is a                                 website and it's done loading a lot of                                 data because you are getting the                                 pictures which are quite ideal you know                                 adding a resolution so it's not meant                                 for mobile in the fact that it's quite                                 using a lot of data but it would be                                 interesting to maybe push forward over                                 application to make them muffin and                                 maybe more easy to use so that while                                 people going live on the ground and                                 doing survey will be it will be easier                                 for them to contribute but maybe not                                 really with each review it's not meant                                 for but we maybe push forward the                                 community to make tours of beta                                 foreground sorry                                 hi I'm Jonathan Brown from Canada and                                 one of the things I see a lack in                                 building a bridge between open data and                                 the OSM there was a great presence at                                 the Madrid international open data                                 conference of OSM but not in Buenos                                 Aires last one the next one is in                                 Nairobi Kenya is wondering if it would                                 be useful to think about combining what                                 you've done with teach osm and then do                                 something as a session in Nairobi as                                 part of the international open data                                 conference yeah for sure we can we can                                 think of ways to make it more known and                                 available for more people but yeah it's                                 still something taking some time so yeah                                 definitely local communities can use it                                 and maybe improve it so a lot right if                                 it answers the question looks like with                                 the open data community in the OSM                                 community okay getting a more                                 sustainable connection between those                                 communities                                 yeah and that's it's interesting to use                                 the Osmos tool because it makes                                 synchronization between the open data                                 set and what's in OpenStreetMap but                                 still it's something technical we should                                 definitely go for own cooperation we've                                 opened that manager it's something we do                                 for example in France we are trying to                                 push for about this visiting episode                                 subject but I know it might not be the                                 case in all countries so yeah definitely                                 it's something a local community should                                 be aware and maybe push forward the                                 authorities to publish more data and see                                 how we can work with OpenStreetMap in                                 some cases I was wondering do you often                                 find that there are points that are                                 nowhere near any kind of imagery at the                                 points that are difficult to validate                                 because because nobody is driven                                 mapillary or op                                               where it can happen sometimes but most                                 of the time we we still find we we still                                 find refuge shows on the picture because                                 mostly data is not bad bad open data is                                 not bad that but it's a most of the time                                 a lack of precision like the feature is                                 there but it's like maybe                                                so it could lead to some problems                                 finding them because we are looking at                                 exact position with a picture                                 so yeah in some time we can't find it                                 because it's like                                                       ideas may need to integrate was easy                                 what is easy to do and for complex cases                                 with                                                                     to look for well and maybe find it or                                 somewhere so yeah it's making the                                 working more easier but we still have                                 some cases to do manually I would say                                 for questions if there are more                                 questions in the audience                                 there's one                                 hi                                 great great - great - one question in                                 your example with the power stations if                                 there's actually not a power station you                                 pressed on skip does it mean that the                                 other people who will do this mission                                 will have this question again and again                                 or is there some way to say okay it                                 definitely doesn't exist here in fact                                 very simple system to handle that if                                 three different peoples keep one feature                                 it is been injured it is not shown to                                 any other user so as long as VI is no                                 new picture of this area any change in                                 the input data we don't show it anymore                                 - of a user so you have to have three                                 different people skipping this feature                                 if it is Eden so that way if you just                                 click miss click on this thing it is not                                 Eden for every one four five I would say                                 so yeah three skips and then it is in                                 your but still it's a way to make this                                 more secure to not lost feature which                                 could be integrated but yeah                                 it looks like your great tool and so                                 it's a good job when you showed us the                                 demo the first thing that came to mind                                 is I mean that's clearly machine                                 learning that we could you could                                 possibly add on the side is that                                 something that you've thought about or                                 something that could help in the future                                 yeah and in fact we are already                                 indirectly using machine learning                                 because we integrate the map reader with                                 detection which are done by a machine                                 learning the idea is what we using human                                 verification to make the data                                 qualitative to make sure very something                                 because my machine learning is improving                                 everyday but it's not                                                 may be more than                                                   OpenStreetMap we are doing very creative                                 things very making sure things are well                                 so that's why it must be doing human job                                 and the idea of using machine learning                                 will be to automate things but before                                 you know actually trying to detect new                                 features and so on and then we can make                                 people validate okay this one is very                                 well detected and it is well so I can                                 put it on OpenStreetMap otherwise we                                 will have a lot of false positive in the                                 database it will be not useful so but                                 the idea                                 so looks like there are no more                                 questions so we think a turian again for                                 the great                                 you                                 [Music]
