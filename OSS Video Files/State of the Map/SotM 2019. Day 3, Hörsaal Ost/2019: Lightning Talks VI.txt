           hold all your questions at the end we'll                               bring all the speakers back up if we                               have any time for four questions so                               first up let's welcome David good                               morning Mabuhay I'm David from the                               Philippines                                I live in altaira also known as New                                Zealand I don't have slides but imagine                                a map of the world with boundaries that                                are different than those that we use in                                our OpenStreetMap we map the one that we                                we love I've been thinking about                                indigenous mapping for a while I'm not                                an indigenous person but I'd like to be                                an ally how many of you here is an                                indigenous person who is an indigenous                                person here there's no one and I think                                that's a problem so I've been thinking                                about this for a long time I'm kind of                                lost so I have some reflections that I'd                                like to read to you and maybe we can                                think about these things and have a long                                conversation this might even take years                                I also make maps by the way okay number                                one indigenous worldviews are                                fundamentally different from the the                                ontology and epistemology that we have                                in some cultures the boundaries are not                                in the imagination like in our culture                                in the Pacific my ancestor we didn't                                have boundaries before the Spaniards                                came our islands were connected in our                                stick charts and the shells for our maps                                and these are relationships and that's a                                fundamentally different type of                                cartography is it cartography okay next                                I read the blog recently by Alan McCann                                cheese he said hey maybe it's time for                                open street map to map indigenous lands                                and that's a nice idea and people have                                been doing it to a lesser greater extent                                but that's just there's a certain per or                                a particular indigenous group want to be                                mapped we have to think about that too                                maybe there should be an OS M code for                                refusal if they don't want to be mapped                                then okay what do you think about that                                and if mapping should happen then which                                knowledge must remain hidden and which                                knowledge must remain say                                great because this is what they learned                                in out your aura I came there hey let's                                do om and then our Mari colleague said                                well I don't know David you just came                                and we have indigenous data sovereignty                                which is a different concept than our                                property model scheme that came from                                Europe                                what does indigenous mapping mean and                                take and are we supposed to be the map                                makers of this particular type of                                initiative these are my last points ok                                so what do you think should we discuss                                how long does it take what should we do                                why for whom with whom what does this                                mean for both the social and technical                                part of OpenStreetMap where are the                                indigenous mappers of osm they are not                                here and if they're not here                                and we are going to prepare this space                                for for that moment when there's an                                indigenous mapper in the next state of                                the map in the data working groups in                                the other working groups in the board                                someday how can we be a good OSM                                ancestor thank you very much                                [Applause]                                mr. Kobe did drugs                                yes                                okay next please welcome disaster                                mappers Heidelberg hi everyone thank you                                all for being here and from disaster my                                PA's Heidelberg we are a group of                                researchers and students from Heidelberg                                who are interested in OpenStreetMap                                especially interested in humanitarian                                street map we usually organize local map                                Athens and sometimes hold workshops but                                we've recently been met with a different                                challenge that I would like to tell you                                about in the next few minutes we've been                                asked to gather all the sub-national                                administrative units in osm sub-national                                here meaning the administrative level                                directly beneath the nation level and                                that turned out to be quite a bit more                                 difficult than we imagined it to be                                 because we want to join it with somatic                                 data joining is in general web very easy                                 from a technical perspective but from                                 the DEP at our perspective it's a little                                 bit more complicated because if you want                                 to join two datasets you need to calm                                 attributes for every feature and that's                                 not so easy to find an open street map                                 because of sometimes illegally mapped                                 features therefore we need to improve                                 the tagging in home street map first of                                 all I would like to tell you about some                                 methods we thought of for acquiring the                                 data who has heard of amber who was M                                 before                                 Oh very few okay rambha who is M is a                                 site which was a boundaries service you                                 can see you can just click on the                                 nation's you can also expand them to                                 find the sub-national units and export                                 them in a lot of formats it's a really                                 great site unfortunately it's not super                                 well fitted for exporting first of all                                 all the units and it also limits                                 matic data that can be exported so the                                 next thing we thought about is overpass                                 it's lost it allows a very specific                                 query to be run you can ask for space                                 you can ask for thematic data you can                                 ask for users you can also ask for edits                                 and time slots the problem is it's not                                 really fit to handle a very large amount                                 of data all over the world so ok what do                                 we do next we download planets osm which                                 is all osm data the smallest you can get                                 it is almost                                                          easy to handle if you want to know more                                 about what M data acquisition and                                 handling we have three different                                 workshop on was M data on a home page                                 these are some Apple Store                                            calm slash mething I will also show the                                 shortest at the end okay so how are                                 batteries even checked usually the first                                 tool of the text that you see here are                                 the most important you need to take                                 boundary is administrative and the                                 administration level for the level                                 directly beneath the state pins beneath                                 the beneath yeah Germany or UK for                                 example the states in the United States                                 are usually three or four four is much                                 more common but you will also find three                                 so it there isn't a global standard for                                 this the name is obviously important as                                 well for us especially important is to                                 iso                                                                   that globally assigns a short string to                                 every sub-national in unit and this is                                 what we would preferably use for our                                 joins because it has proven to be very                                 challenging to probably draw in on the                                 names because names sometimes                                 in English in your data set and native                                 in OpenStreetMap they sometimes contain                                 additions just as province or region or                                 state sometimes in English sometimes in                                 native language so it's not easy to join                                 this it's also not easy to correct                                 yourself because it's almost                                       features you can also add more likely                                 key date English names or any names it's                                 best if you check your local units                                 because as I told you can be level                                      can be level                                                             the area where you're mapping note that                                 admin level is also used for government                                 buildings that that's important so is                                 really neat boundary administrative to                                 identify it we identify it almost                                     units with missing tags I upload a                                 commerce abit values that high where you                                 can find the names the IDS in                                 OpenStreetMap so please feel free to                                 have a look at them and if you find any                                 that you know I would be very happy if                                 you can add some of the text that I told                                 you or that you can think of I'm very                                 thankful for your attendance and any

about                                 this                                 Germany state of the map conference to                                 launch up compare Japanese version right                                 so anyway our Japanese researcher group                                 focus on the trust of the crowd-sourced                                 geographical information Sciences last                                 years ago so we are now analysis truth                                 so not only the opposite map data but                                 also the bridge I had a quality                                 assessment and also we are focused on                                 user motivation so anyway we just                                 started to launch the Japan map compare                                 and also we can you access to happy to                                 have to any code so head of the                                 developing map compare Japanese version                                 the this site can compare various web                                 Maps focus on the recent rehear that all                                 the web map services of course the Open                                 Street Map and being Google easily and                                 in Japanese map agency can publish the                                 map fan and also the geospatial                                 geospatial information Institute of the                                 Japanese mapped agency it is also the                                 inspired by the original map compare                                 coded by the G fabrics                                 thank you so much to geo fabric have                                 aside right it is developed using the                                 when mapping technology likely Freight                                 the bilges and also that you can show                                 the handle be as a node.js application                                 so this site was developed with me                                 remain in Japanese but come pre so focus                                 on opposite map data so anyway we can                                 now access to a computer JP and also our                                 site is compared even when map contents                                 about the max maximum is                                            recently map shows so anyway we can now                                 develop link to the static links so                                 panels and zooms and that should not                                 choose sounds web map patterns to memory                                 memorize to you can use this zone and                                 also your scalable to lead to be a                                 smartphone application you can show some                                 compared to the read maps to using this                                 not form so anyway our map compare                                 license is this by the BSD license so                                 you can always shows and use using our                                 map compute JP website so I think again                                 for original harm up compare developed                                 by Joe fabric so anyway to show me the                                 video so you can compare to the some we                                 attached some map services of course we                                 are proud to next stage to other                                 map web map services it's included this                                 site so not only you can shows in                                 Japanese area but also this version is a                                 worldwide show how about only the                                 Japanese area to be much to wait better                                 data set so you can show this is a four                                 screen and that's six type of screen                                 type and maximum of size is eight sites                                 okay                                 please touch our application so thank                                 you so much                                 our fourth speaker is Italian about                                 quick OSM                                 hiya good morning everyone I'm going to                                 show you two tools but I'm working on                                 keep yeah no problem so I'm going to                                 show you two tools that I'm working on                                 to use osm the recent vector data in qgs                                 so the first one is called docker osm I                                 can't explain to you what is to occur                                 but dock USM is like post gist database                                 with automatic updates of the OSM                                 database so it's a docker compose                                 project with free containers in it so                                 you have employ same post GIS or a same                                 update so the idea is like quite simple                                 you take just one a simple PDF file and                                 you put it in a specific folder of                                 docker SM and you just press I mean you                                 just do make run and the idea is like                                 your PDF file is imported into the                                 Pastis database so you have all your                                 your layers created following what you                                 did in the employ same default                                 configuration and automatically every                                 two minutes this system will be updated                                 with the live OS m data and it's                                 possible to customize this configuration                                 so you can set up like custom URL for                                 the defiles default update interval you                                 can also add some extra SQL queries like                                 if you want to have some index triggers                                 views and also some QG styles are                                 included in the database so when you                                 load them from huges you may have like                                 some default styles already so it's on                                 github like you have the address that's                                 the first tool that I'm using to use                                 vector data will in qgs and the other                                 one is a plug-in so you can either work                                 with local PDF files also or you can use                                 queries with overpass overpass so you                                 can ask one key like I mean by default                                 we download all our send data if you let                                 the key and the value empty when you can                                 define one key or one value that you                                 want to query with the overpass then for                                 the extent we try to do what                                 overpass tuber is doing so you may like                                 have in around                                 like in a specific area or you can have                                 you can use layer extent map convey                                 extent and quicker ISM is also providing                                 some default actions that some people                                 may not know like but if you want like                                 you can edit osm features and it will                                 lounge over ID order awesome straight                                 from huges and quick way we also pass                                 the data that you download it so if you                                 have like some map really not purely map                                 you ready                                 a map in our your links or Wikipedia or                                 wiki data it will just like offer user                                 link to open the web page or here you                                 can see that just openings go to                                 mapillary plugin then if you already                                 like used awesome data within huges you                                 usually have this ash tor field in huges                                 it's not very convenient to work with so                                 just keep in mind that you can either                                 use quick osm to load your local file it                                 will just explode h                                                  using huge ease                                                          a better support for h store field so it                                 will explode your i mean there is a                                 native algorithm in qg c qg                                           you can explode your H store field and                                 also you can also include is build some                                 graphical models so I don't know if you                                 are used to it you can like build some                                 models with some inputs some algorithm                                 and some outputs so you can use quickly                                 same within the graphical model builder                                 so for instance a I'm just using one                                 input it's an extent when I'd say okay                                 I'm building a query so it's a minute                                 equal sorry emergency equal fire hydrant                                 then I'm downloading the query and I'm                                 like the query will come in                                            degrees so I want everything in meters                                 so I'm just doing a reproduction in my                                 local                                 CRS and I'm doing a buffering so I get                                 then at the end like two layers one for                                 five hundred and one                                 area so when you have like you just you                                 can have some presets with some queries                                 already like saved in your queue geez so                                 I just double click on fire hydrant on                                 the right and then the model will                                 execute by itself and I have two layers                                 at the end so you can like just use                                 every algorithm from quit from huges                                 like buffering reprojection intersection                                 and yeah so I'm always looking for ell                                 translations documentation z'                                 i have plenty of ideas for quick ways                                 i'm like to have like mad presets where                                 you don't need like to know the key is a                                 value to have like from for instance                                 bicycle maps integrate gsm presets also                                 whatever well I have some ideas so yeah                                 that's it it's a variable on qgs and on                                 github also                                 [Applause]                                 thank you so we do have a couple minutes                                 for questions so if the speaker's want                                 to all come up here we can take a couple                                 questions and then after this is the                                 coffee break so you can also find the                                 speakers there so any question                                 okay I further quick Oh Sam is there is                                 a easy way to import in the docker OSM                                 with our own schema not a impose awesome                                 schema docker is same I was just using                                 the default employ same file but that's                                 you can customize it when you download                                 the project you can customize layers                                 that you want attributes tags and if you                                 want a generalized version of your table                                 that's all possible in in poison yes I                                 hope I have a remark and a question for                                 the first speaker you're raising a very                                 important point of mapping indigenous                                 people and indigenous people territories                                 I'm afraid you're posing questions that                                 cannot be answered in general you know                                 they are very location specific and and                                 one question that I would like to pose                                 to you is the following as OpenStreetMap                                 is trying to near completion in local                                 context the question is going to be                                 whether the data that we have is                                 perceived from an open world perspective                                 or from a closed world perspective and                                 what is meant by that is whether you can                                 assume that what is not there it doesn't                                 really exist and and you know in the                                 open world perspective you you don't                                 believe that you think there's always                                 more in the closed world perspective you                                 assume what you have is all that's there                                 and that is a very fundamental point                                 that you need to raise when you come to                                 indigenous peoples mapping because it's                                 really it will tell you something about                                 that and what is important there                                 is what is the what is the law of the                                 country telling you are the indigenous                                 peoples rights and with that you can                                 possibly play this and so to come back                                 to give you an example of this you pose                                 us the question are you in                                 are there any indigenous people here and                                 I was posing myself the question well                                 define indigenous for me because you                                 know I feel like I'm indigenous to where                                 I live because I was born there and all                                 my family was born there but I don't                                 think you meant that yeah so you know                                 what does it mean to be not indigenous                                 it's a reverse question so my question                                 to you is does this what I just said                                 does this apply to your the case that                                 you have in front of you                                 how are people's rights absorbed in the                                 in the local law is there are there                                 sentiments for not being mapped and what                                 would those be thanks for that I can at                                 least even in a tangential way respond                                 first if it's about the open and closed                                 world perspective I think we also need                                 to think thank you for that these are                                 wonderful                                 this is wonderful inside I think we need                                 to also ask about the basis of that why                                 why is it open what does it mean was                                 disclosed mean because it comes from a                                 particular value system just to add                                 because when whenever I talk with our                                 digital colleagues even map makers they                                 say well I know David to come you                                 studied this GIS etc but in our                                 community not everything has to be                                 shared to the world and maybe that's the                                 way it is about the thing that's in                                 front of me what's in front of me I                                 think is maybe a conversation that's all                                 I can do again I am NOT trying to lead                                 an initiative or etcetera but I think                                 there has to be a conversation and the                                 things that you said maybe it depends on                                 the country maybe it depends on their                                 laws what does it mean to be indigenous                                 and even there were determined is honest                                 is very spirit                                 entry maybe it's case case basis maybe                                 this is not the responsibility of                                 OpenStreetMap                                 it's also possible maybe there has to be                                 another group that could sound                                 provocative to you but whenever I I go                                 to other communities well David if you                                 trace our buildings the military's gonna                                 come and bump our village and they're                                 gonna get our forests and they're gonna                                 get our minds and okay I'm gonna step                                 back and not make a map so these are                                 just thoughts I'm also kind of lost                                 right now but thank you for that thank                                 you very much                                 [Applause]
