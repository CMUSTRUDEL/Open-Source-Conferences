https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/T134-OSM_and_the_European_agenda

The EU Member States, EEA/EFTA and neighbouring (incl. candidate and accession) countries have been working over the past decade together with the European Commission and agencies to build the pan-European infrastructure to manage and share more efficiently geospatial data. This effort has largely been leveraged through the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive. INSPIRE is focused on the official data coming from public institutions. In parallel, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an open collaborative project that has created a free editable map of the world with the contributions of interested volunteers. With this contribution, we would like to contemplate on these two data infrastructures and argue that it makes full sense if they complement each other. We propose to cover several European use cases: Linkage between OSM and INSPIRE and the possibilities to improve the quality of the data in both directions; Extraction of data from OSM for cultural heritage and analysis of disasters; OSM for European Commission services as provided by DG ESTAT.

okay good morning still everybody it's

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,240
nice to be here with the OpenStreetMap

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,309
community I'm not really belonging to

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,380
that world I'm coming from a bit

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,570
slightly bit different world from the

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,850
inspire world you probably heard all

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,740
about inspire which stands for

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,590
infrastructure for spatial information

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,590
in Europe so it's more on public data

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,470
and data coming from at most from

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,539
national mapping agencies however I'm

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,040
not working in national mapping agency I

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,520
am working in the European Commission in

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,260
the joint research centre which is very

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,870
close basically here to Milano we are

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,219
situated in East bra on on Lago Maggiore

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,320
which is some 50 kilometers from here

00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:48,210
let me first introduce my co-authors in

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,420
this paper so these are my colleagues

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:55,949
from GRC alexander kots f michael lutz

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,260
and robert thomas we also have some

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,390
contribution from Eurostat where our

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,489
colleague harness Reuter who is mainly

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,280
dealing with the mapping in the Eurostat

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,740
and then we have several examples here

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,240
coming basically from some kind of

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,520
collaboration between OpenStreetMap as

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,009
volunteered map project and basically

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,330
national mapping agency so one example

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,330
is sorry

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,340
one example is from Spain from National

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,700
Geographic Institute and the other

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,829
example is from the Institute for on

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,130
territorial system for innovation

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:40,110
colleagues coming from Torino here in

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:42,329
Italy what to say about the GRC as a GRC

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,240
is basically one of the directorate

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,490
generals of the European Commission GRC

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,090
spread around several countries so the

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,939
biggest part of GRC is here in Italy in

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,540
is Pro as I said on the lake maggiore

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,329
and if you look for it on the Google

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,430
Maps you will get something like that

00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:04,549
but if you go on the OpenStreetMap then

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:09,090
you will have completely different

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:11,460
figure ok the area where we are working

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,650
was the previous nuclear power

00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,810
or plants so it's a really secured

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,700
around there is a great fence and

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,400
security guards on the entrance and so

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,800
on and so on but still it seems there

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,350
are a living OpenStreetMap community

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:31,320
also working in the GRC okay so an

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,260
outline what I will speak in this 15

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,540
minutes or so I will mention disco which

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,770
stands for GIS for the European

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,990
Commission which is run by Eurostat then

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,170
very briefly very shortly about the

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:48,150
inspire as I said I think probably all

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,160
familiar with the inspire or at least

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,470
you heard about it and then I will try

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,860
to give you some examples of how

00:02:52,470 --> 00:03:01,890
basically OpenStreetMap and inspire are

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:04,230
fitting fitting together disco as I said

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,700
it stands for GIS for the European

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,610
Commission basically its lead by the

00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,890
director-general Eurostat what is risk

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,950
of doing so there are a lot of needs on

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:20,280
the European Commission level for the

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:23,970
spatial data so basically in all many

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,150
policies you need to have spatial data

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:31,500
and to use them as a support but also

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:34,350
for the evidence in implementation and

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,620
monitoring of the European policies this

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,510
is also somehow the role the main role

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,100
of the joint research center where I am

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,890
coming from because what we are doing

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,500
there we are doing scientific support to

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,470
policy so basically from planning and

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,580
policy through implementation and then

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:57,060
later monitoring of the policy and and

00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:59,340
evaluation so disco is providing basic

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,530
services for the Commission which means

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,390
geographical data but also statistical

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:08,550
data obviously because it's run by the

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:12,090
Eurostat and they are using several type

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:14,070
of services mostly these web tools which

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,750
are available for the people who are

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,459
working for the European Commission but

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:25,490
also in the agencies and other European

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:28,940
European institutions inspire 2007

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,810
inspire let's say baby was born and at

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,810
that time

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:36,610
Nokia already sold out 15 million of

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,150
this well recognized and well known

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,910
cellular phone

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,220
what is inspire inspire is a piece of

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,900
legislation it's a European regulation

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,090
it's a framework directive which

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,020
concerns of course European Member

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,970
States and basically the goal of this

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,070
directive is to establish an

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,320
infrastructure for spatial information

00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,930
in Europe it is based on the National

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,750
spatial data infrastructures and it is

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:06,020
based on public data or data coming from

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:09,470
from public authority so inspired when

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,740
it was designed let's say some 10 years

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,900
or even more ago 15 years ago it didn't

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,570
concern at this time volunteer

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,360
geographic information also neither need

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,580
a private data coming from private

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,810
companies so it is clearly and strictly

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:29,479
focused basically on the data from

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,520
public authority mostly from national

00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:33,770
mapping agency but many other public

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:39,020
authorities because the wide spread of

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:43,970
data teams in inspire cover really big

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:46,580
big big big big areas inspired GRC I

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,009
already mentioned that the GRC is

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,039
involved in the support to policymaking

00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,570
and GRC was involved from starting from

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,150
the beginning of inspire so from

00:05:53,570 --> 00:06:00,110
drafting which started let's say in 2000

00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:02,000
2001 and what we are doing right now we

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,400
are still technical coordinator of the

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,710
inspire directive we are also providing

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,009
tools different type of tools for

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,169
validation testing of the infrastructure

00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:14,360
access to member states geo portals

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:17,240
through central access point which is

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,270
inspired geoportal and also contribution

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,820
to our ability of different type of

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,120
priority datasets which of interest of

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,430
the Commission we are also supporting

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,840
so-called maintenance and implementation

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:36,290
framework so basically discussing

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,180
and taking the common actions basically

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,090
with the people from the Member States

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:44,150
with the experts and so on it with the

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,250
goal to establish the European

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,310
infrastructure so this is a kind of

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:53,330
roadmap of of the inspires so it started

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:55,400
as I said baby was born in 2007 with the

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,950
legislation and then transposition

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,440
period for the Member States and with

00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,780
the drafting of guidelines and and and

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,669
data models and right now basically we

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,620
are still in the phase of the

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:11,180
implementation so the work is still not

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:14,419
done and basically there's some kind of

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:17,030
foreseen date of the infrastructure to

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,940
be fully established is twenty twenty or

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,040
twenty twenty-one we can say and of

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,260
course after bed I mean inspire is a

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,150
process so it will not stop for sure at

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,760
twenty twenty but it will continue to

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:32,900
develop so there will be a phase of of

00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:35,540
maintenance and and evolution what's the

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,280
state of play right now so these are

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,830
some numbers coming from official

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,210
inspired dashboard where you can see

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:47,390
basically the number of metadata records

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:49,160
from the Member States sorry so there

00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,169
are more than one hundred thousand

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,530
metadata records and there you can see

00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:57,890
also many many different spatial data

00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:01,180
services especially for view and

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,600
download and of course there is more

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,460
also available on the on the national

00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,740
national level but when you compare this

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,220
figure with this one then it's a nice

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:16,190
phenomenon that at the same time

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:19,030
starting there from 2007 up to today we

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,360
have also a huge increase of the

00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,750
OpenStreetMap

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,600
registered users so it seems that in a

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,610
parallel way from one point inspire was

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,250
pushing let's say public authorities and

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:34,010
so-called alterative data to become

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,260
available for reuse for different

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,289
purposes and on the same time basically

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,050
we have a huge increase of the data

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,060
coming from volunteers and this is

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,050
something which needs needs for sure to

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,709
be too big

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:51,740
and so let me show you a few examples

00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:55,430
where OpenStreetMap is used and how it

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:58,279
work how it works together with

00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,800
basically public and out relative data I

00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,959
already mentioned disco which is

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,870
providing services for the Commission

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,880
and basically a disco and Eurostat is

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,190
using heavily OpenStreetMap as a

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,779
background map for different type of

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:17,540
services you can see some information

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:19,940
about what is used and how it's used

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,760
it is interesting basically to stressed

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,540
that OpenStreetMap is used at the

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,060
Commission level the reason why is such

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,610
a case it's basically that the data

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,500
public data authoritatively data coming

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,269
from member states are still not really

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:40,339
available so this is the main reason and

00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:41,959
basically we are trying to fight with

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,760
the member states with the national

00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:47,029
agencies and so on and so on to provide

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,130
to provide the data so as I said inspire

00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:53,510
is still in the implementation phase and

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:56,240
hopefully we will have all those data on

00:09:53,510 --> 00:10:02,120
the roadmap till 2020 but it's still

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:04,670
some time to go to to be happen by using

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,290
open state map of course European

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:10,240
Commission needs to be politically

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:12,560
correct so their what they are doing

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,920
basically they are taking OpenStreetMap

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,560
and then they need also to implement

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,610
let's say the political position of the

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,430
European Commission

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:25,279
so basically when we are talking for

00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:27,890
example about disputed areas they need

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,390
to be solution of how to really show it

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,160
because every document which is

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,480
published by the European Commission

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,160
needs to be politically correct so

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,810
basically there are few examples what

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,540
they are doing in Euro stats so they are

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:45,949
trying so basically to correct somehow

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,959
in a political way data coming from the

00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:51,019
OpenStreetMap so you have here four

00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:54,050
examples of green in Ukraine and then

00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:56,600
Kosovo and also Macedonia where for

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,200
example the name of Macedonia cannot be

00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,730
used in

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,130
official documents but the Former

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,320
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and so on

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,970
and so on so this is the type and this

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,660
is the background map then which is

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:12,220
corrected and which the people working

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:15,110
in European Commission can can use

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,450
another example is from the National

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,130
geographical Institute from Spain what

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,140
they are doing they have a collaboration

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,000
with the OpenStreetMap and basically

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,160
they are providing data from their

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,380
national transport network database

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,510
which is based on the inspire data

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,220
models and together with the

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,250
OpenStreetMap basically they're

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:37,130
improving the content on both sides on

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:39,560
on on both both ends and the

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,620
collaboration is very successful and

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,660
basically this national geographical

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:50,060
Institute of Spain together with many

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:51,830
others contributors from Spain is listed

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,890
of course in the OpenStreetMap and they

00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:59,450
are very happy about about this mutual

00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:01,120
collaboration another example we had a

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:06,440
few years ago

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:09,080
one pilot project which was contracted

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,380
basically for this institute from Torino

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,800
which I mentioned City what they were

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:18,410
trying to develop is some kind of

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,750
combination of cultural heritage and

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,720
hazards in the Danube bridge in the

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:28,100
Danube region so the project was aimed

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,590
to support the new strategy and it was

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,070
quite challenges challenged project

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:35,630
because it took 14 countries and some of

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,940
them are member states some of them are

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:41,510
not member states so basically they use

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:45,620
different data sources for this for this

00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:47,960
project you can see sources up for the

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,180
natural hazards but then also sources

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,330
for cultural heritage and one of the

00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:57,230
source was also OpenStreetMap for the

00:12:53,330 --> 00:13:01,280
cultural heritage what they found out in

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:04,100
this project is that data as such are

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,990
hosted in OpenStreetMap in many

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:10,350
different categories so it was not

00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:12,630
really easy to extract the data about

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,400
our heritage so it's in many many

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,880
different areas such as buildings

00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:24,240
transport land use waterways and so on

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:26,910
and so on so this was the result of the

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,150
project so basically they were trying to

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:33,810
assess hazards regarding to national

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:37,170
disasters for for the cultural cultural

00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:40,290
heritage some kind of follow-up of this

00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:43,800
project is the risk alt project right

00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:46,890
now we're basically a City Institute

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,710
continued activities and this is now an

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,410
international best practice project on

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,210
cultural cultural heritage which if

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:59,970
you're interested you can find more on

00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:02,460
the project project web webpage some

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,160
findings from the project what I

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,170
mentioned basically what they found good

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:11,190
flow for the OpenStreetMap

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:13,170
and what maybe not so good or weak so

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,120
there are many strengths first of all

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:18,090
it's data already catalogued

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,850
geo-reference ready to be downloaded of

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:23,490
course for free data constantly updated

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:26,190
data free as I said so there is no

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,620
economic effort required for database

00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,560
maintenance and update and data easily

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,890
accessible on the other hands and

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,020
weaknesses data on cultural heritage as

00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,030
a mention already are spread across

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:42,990
different categories so it's not easy to

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:46,230
find what you are looking for data are

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:48,480
often also not coherent so with some

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:52,190
international standards on cultural

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:56,130
heritage for example set by UNESCO or

00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:58,610
other national national standards there

00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:03,090
is no very verification and validation

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:06,810
applied to data that consequently cannot

00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,700
be used by emergency operators or local

00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:11,520
authorities to deal with natural hazards

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:14,010
risk prevention and reported data not

00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,850
collected tailored or structured on the

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:19,770
basis of emergency operators needs so

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,200
this is let's say some kind of the

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,620
conclusion from the city Institute what

00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:29,339
they found out

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:33,310
by using OpenStreetMap so this comes

00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:36,370
with some conclusions so basically what

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:41,290
we can conclude from these examples and

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:43,660
from these slides so many times when I

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,490
don't know if you go to Euro Geographics

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,890
conference which is organization

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,589
umbrella of national mapping agencies in

00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,930
Europe covering not only Member States

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:55,210
but the broad Europe there are always

00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:59,410
discussion so what this is is

00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:03,130
OpenStreetMap basically a threat to them

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:06,040
or is it an opportunity and how they see

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,960
on on debt so I think from from this

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,450
example that I showed you I mean it is

00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,550
it is clear more or less that for sure

00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:15,550
it is not a threat that it's a big

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,950
opportunity and from our point of view

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,620
the boat basically the bullet

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,720
infrastructure if we can call it and I'm

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,000
sure I can we can call OpenStreetMap

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,580
process and infrastructure but based on

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,589
the volunteer geographic information

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:34,240
should be complimentary so should be

00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:36,160
mutually used to find and to achieve

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,070
synergies and this is already happening

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,620
so as I mentioned you saw it from the in

00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,980
the example of Spain but there are also

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,560
around Europe other examples where

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,709
basically national mapping agencies or

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:55,089
providers of authoritative data are also

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:56,950
using OpenStreetMap data so also the

00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:59,860
data coming coming from the

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:03,610
OpenStreetMap community and I think

00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:07,390
message is clear so it it is may be to

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:10,329
see how this should be even this

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:13,660
connection should be strengthened for

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:15,730
the future for the future work because

00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,220
it's obvious that the amount of data

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:22,179
which is coming from the volunteer

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:26,079
geographic information community is

00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:29,740
bigger and bigger and obviously mapping

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,570
agencies they cannot follow this so of

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,929
course they need to change their

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:36,470
business models and to adopt some

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:42,500
changes in their every

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:46,090
everyday work before I'm ending just a

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:49,549
few notifications or I wouldn't say

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:52,340
advertisement there is ongoing safe call

00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:56,210
which is connecting European facility

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:58,850
and basically there it's very

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,760
interesting because it's it's an

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:05,809
opportunity for funding for big let's

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,950
say pan-european datasets and especially

00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:13,220
in the point to its called for the

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:17,080
provision and generation of spatial data

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:20,240
so harmonized ematic open datasets in

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:23,240
particular geospatial data so I think

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,549
this could be a nice opportunity maybe

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,190
also for the for this community for the

00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:30,200
OpenStreetMap community to see how it

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,880
can be further explored I think the

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,690
minimum requirement is that you have

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,970
five countries on board so at least and

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,669
of course if you have more countries

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,890
which in a cross-border it could be

00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:47,650
something which can be used to maybe

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:52,549
improve OpenStreetMap at least in Europe

00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:54,200
the another announcement is also that we

00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:56,360
are annually organizing inspire

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,530
conference and this year it will be in

00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,700
Antwerp and usually we have some

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,220
presentation there from OpenStreetMap

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,320
community and it's always nice to see

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,590
how as I said this these two

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:13,220
infrastructure are basically merging and

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:16,630
and getting together so thank you very

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,630
much for your attention

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:26,200
and of course questions welcome

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,440
thank you sir I have two quick questions

00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:43,370
first about the grinnell the granularity

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,070
of what is allowed at the you level your

00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:49,640
data is categorized in not so one that's

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:51,950
two not so three usually is it possible

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,890
to go below not so three do you know

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:58,850
about the rules for that and my second

00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:01,580
question is about the data sets that the

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,280
you Commission is providing which is

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,080
usually incomplete and what I've seen

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,430
myself is that there's a lot of holes

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,680
and a lack of again of local kernel

00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,300
arity usually the data is at the country

00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,160
level for example when you want to tap

00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:20,690
into deaf go into near into echo data

00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,090
it's always at country level and never

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,450
at a provincial or at the district level

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:30,830
which makes it very difficult to use it

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:32,420
for jes studies thank you sir thank you

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,260
for the questions so on the first one

00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:37,640
regarding the levels probably the

00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,380
question should be addressed to Eurostat

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,410
directly because they are dealing they

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:45,170
have agreement bits OpenStreetMap on

00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:48,080
what and how they how they are using I

00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:50,390
would say probably is possible but I'm

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,580
not hundred percent sure so the right

00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,160
address would be Hannes Reuter from us

00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,710
that's to address regarding the second

00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,010
question yeah you are absolutely right

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:03,260
inspire is basically not only on the

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,150
national level but there are many locals

00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,720
so if you go to inspire geoportal and

00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:11,150
searching for the data for some country

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,370
there is probability very high that you

00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:16,730
will find a lot of local datasets

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:19,550
regional or whatever and that then you

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,860
will have to combine it somehow and it's

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:24,290
still a bit difficult to do so because

00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,590
the datasets are usually not harmonized

00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:30,740
so and that's why I said the

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:32,930
implementation period is still now so

00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,200
basically we are pushing Member States

00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,640
at least to harmonize the data and

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,370
inspire you have these three on access

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,450
probably you are familiar with this and

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,690
deadlines for our next one already

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,720
passed but still the data are not

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,580
harmonised way we as a GRC cannot do

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,370
much so the policy master is DJ

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,919
environment basically who is pushing the

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,340
member states to provide data as soon as

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,320
possible so I I hope with some political

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:06,059
will that the situation will will

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:06,059
improve but let's see Thanks

00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:19,560
hi two quick questions so your data

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:23,310
model is it open and can we essentially

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:27,600
see how it looks like it's the data

00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:30,270
model yes is it open and can we see how

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,460
it looks like so all inspired data

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:34,710
models are open fully so if you go to

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,720
inspire web page you can find schema

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:39,210
schema so you can download it and you

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,750
can immediately use it thank you and the

00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,640
second question is the data availability

00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,100
are you trying to make it available

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,120
across the board and is it under which

00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:54,660
license so Creative Commons or that's a

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:58,040
good point again so basically the

00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:00,450
inspire is not putting regulatory

00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,730
obligations on the data licensing so

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,710
basically it's on the country's what we

00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,070
recommended is to use some kinds of

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,110
called

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,690
inspire licenses which are close to the

00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:11,700
one that you have mentioned but we are

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:15,000
just now running the study across the

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,800
Europe to see what is going on and the

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,570
first findings from the study already

00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,940
showing us that there are many different

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,610
licensing models so starting from some

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:28,050
organizational licenses and then to some

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:30,150
open licenses and so on and so on so for

00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:42,000
sure the situation should be harmonized

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:45,060
in that field as well thank you any so

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,180
we can prepare the next session thank

00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,180
you

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,869
