One way of exploring the information in Wikidata is through maps. This lightning talk will provide a series of example maps generated through SPARQL queries to the Wikidata query service. The aim is to stimulate discussion about the potential for linking geo data with structured data from other domains through Wikidata.

yeah so I tweeted the link to my talk it

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:06,600
is a life on wiki data and you can get

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,160
there as well you just go to wiki data

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:14,790
and you type in WD for wiki data : s o

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,490
TM 2018 which is basically the hash tag

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,119
and then you end up on this page which

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,400
is the mobile view it's just one slide

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,000
but it's a very long one and I only have

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,429
five minutes so a general thing is here

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,099
you have an overview slide this map

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,649
represents items in which data that have

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,040
a geolocation and the color kind of

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,930
gives you the density and for any of

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,110
those images embedded on the page if you

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,980
click on them you get details on the

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,579
methodology of the queries and things

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,190
like that

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,829
I don't have time to go into this now

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,570
I'll just give you a range of queries

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,940
that give you an idea of the kind of

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,050
data that is in wiki data and that has

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,359
relevance for geo applications so here

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,290
is disasters by location we've

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,360
color-coded by a disaster type then

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,979
other things you can geolocate is for

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,920
instance the topics of scientific

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,360
articles some of those topics will be

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,140
things that have a geolocation you can

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,270
plot that on a map then you can go for

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,299
place names just look at those in

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,509
Germany that end on off or it's which is

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,130
basically Slavic of Slavic origin and

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,490
you basically see where the slaves have

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,380
have been living before you can look at

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,759
names of streets so here we have women

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,350
by the number of streets in the

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,840
Netherlands that have been named after

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,659
these women and so you hear the you see

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,340
you connect the queen beatrix 500

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,110
streets in the Netherlands named after

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:52,619
her and so on here's Anna Frank with 28

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,430
or something another thing is street

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:59,009
addresses in Italy by entity type so

00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:02,549
many of these are palaces museums and

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:07,380
things like that of course we can also

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:09,390
zoom in so here is a part of a map which

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,929
where the map shows historic places in

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,120
Canada and

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,959
we zoom in on the center of the city of

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,260
Quebec there you see basically it's all

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:23,640
OpenStreetMap data what you can also do

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,650
is federate queries this means the data

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,689
from wiki data can be combined with data

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,319
from somewhere else all of these queries

00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:35,670
the part that you see here is sparkle

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,560
which is a query language and with that

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,870
sparkle clear you can actually combine

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,439
the data from different ends and so here

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,319
you get basically cash machines around

00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,540
the center of Munich where the machines

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,370
belong to a specific interbank network

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,079
the interbank networks is something in

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,419
some data that wiki data doesn't really

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,400
have information about so you go out to

00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,780
the other endpoint and fetch the data

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,000
from there I actually tried it for

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,099
Milano it didn't work here because data

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,650
in wiki data is often incomplete in

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,230
terms of completeness the largest

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,450
Wikipedia has five million entries wiki

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,900
data at the moment has 50 million so it

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,790
is much larger than Wikipedia any single

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,560
Wikipedia and it's also larger than all

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,940
Wikipedia's combined in terms of the

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,579
number of topics that it covers also it

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,340
is meant to be read by humans in any of

00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,620
the Wikipedia languages so about 300 but

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,019
it is also meant to be read and used and

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,290
edited by machines and so it's a very

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:37,129
interesting model system or general

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,229
platform for all sorts of automated

00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:43,829
workflows another interesting map is

00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:46,259
disputed territories then you can see

00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,699
election results so the geo shapes for

00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,439
that they can be stored on Wikimedia

00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,049
Commons and then you can combine that

00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:56,069
but the data is actually hosted on wiki

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:58,109
data you have data about occupations of

00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,079
people so here you have birth places of

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:03,269
disease botanists color-coded by the era

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,909
in which they were born

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:10,530
or you can get paintings by young female

00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:13,019
fun Delft that actually depicted maps or

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,169
you can get a tree of territorial

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,570
entities with all the maps and and like

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:20,039
the capital of the region which is here

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,540
Milano you can't really read that but

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:25,300
yeah the slide is online

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,330
or you can get time-series so here you

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:32,830
get in check a series of check place

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:37,750
names in a time series ordered by first

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:40,060
mentioning the historic record or here

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,950
you see basically the change lock on the

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,040
key data in terms of geo-located items

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,410
between 2014 and 2017 so you see there

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,000
is quite some activity happening over

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,630
those three years and it's still going

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,750
on here's an interesting plot it has on

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:59,530
the horizontal axis it has time and on

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,420
the vertical axis it has latitude so you

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,580
see that there is on certain latitudes

00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,320
on the planet we have data that goes

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,350
really far back in time on other

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:11,410
latitudes it's only more recently that

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,690
we actually did gather some data which

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,820
data also has information about things

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,950
that are not located on our planet so

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:22,660
for instance here we have some mountains

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:25,780
on the moon and wicked item makes use of

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,020
a MediaWiki extension you might know the

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,030
OSM wiki is based on MediaWiki and so is

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,860
wikipedia and so is wiki data but it

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,960
makes use of a specific extension to

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,910
media wiki that does the semantic stuff

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,040
that it basically turns the JSON in the

00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,380
wiki page into rdf that condemned my

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,030
query and you can run your own wiki

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,620
based instance in fact yesterday in a

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,290
discussion was suggested that OS I'm

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,360
looking into using wiki base for storing

00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,570
for instance that the meaning of the

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,120
tags and here is a query from such a

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,240
separate wiki base which is run by

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,980
historians who are analyzing records

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,610
about the Illuminati which was a secret

00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,800
society in 19th century and so here you

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,660
get the places from which those guys

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,600
have sent the letters to their secret

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,190
society and then there is a registry for

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,160
the wiki based ecosystem so you can

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,200
query the a wiki base instance as to

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,120
what other public wiki base instances

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,710
are out there the key message is

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,970
everything is connected and here's a

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,590
game that is actually called

00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,300
everything's connected and it's

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,769
basically a puzzle that is based on wiki

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:32,399
data thank you okay

00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:32,399
