https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/L031-OpenStreetMap_and_Wikimedia/

This short presentation gives a short overview of the collaborations and cross-activities between the OSM and Wikimedia communities.

I plan for this to be the SotM-equivalent of similar presentations I gave at Wikimania 2014[1] and WikidataCon 2017[2] but updated for an OSM audience.

okay thanks so good afternoon I'll be

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,120
talking about how the different commits

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,160
the OpenStreetMap in networking media

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,260
humanities help and collaborate with

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,130
each other and make you so much other's

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,619
projects so usually when I talk about

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,720
OpenStreetMap to wikimedia communities i

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,869
say that OpenStreetMap is like wikipedia

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,970
for max but recently I've been telling

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,430
him saying that OpenStreetMap is really

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,710
like wiki data for geographical data and

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,840
I would like to thank Daniel for

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,880
explaining all the different things that

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,410
you can do using metadata so

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,500
OpenStreetMap as we know has notes waist

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,149
relation stars keys values cetera in a

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,399
similar way which data has items

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,430
statements properties values qualifiers

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,030
etc these are quite similar things in

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,530
concepts and actually if you follow the

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,780
data modeling discussions of the wiki

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,489
data project chat page there are surely

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,270
quite similar to the discussions of the

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,899
OSM stacking mailing list so if your

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,489
member of both communities you can

00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:07,830
understand the different debates and

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,159
arguments that are happening how to

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,240
model things features places and points

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,240
of interests so let's talk about how

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,650
Wikimedia is being used in OpenStreetMap

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,720
first of all the same wiki is powered by

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,939
meteor wiki the wiki engine developed by

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,250
which meter and this also provides

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,290
access to Wikimedia Commons images so

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,500
for example here's a picture of an added

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,650
on the awesome wiki so twelve illustrate

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,390
what an atom is type definitions in the

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,820
awesome wiki also link to Wikipedia and

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,590
wicked data to help clarify features so

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,119
if you need more information about what

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,170
an atom is you can go to the Wikipedia

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,820
article also objects can link to

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,979
corresponding Wikipedia articles and key

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,360
data items using the Wikipedia and

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,740
related ads respectively and the

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,360
opposite hip and foundation has derived

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,520
its local chapters agreement and

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,680
trademark policy from corresponding

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,009
documents from the wikimedia foundation

00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,229
so the wikimedia foundation foundation

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:12,690
has done a lot of stuff that actually

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:14,400
the awesome or SMF copies next we go to

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,640
how osm is used in the Wikimedia

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,620
projects first of all obviously awesome

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,090
has been used to create maps to

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,700
illustrate Wikipedia articles and

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,680
populate Wikimedia Commons this is a

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,630
picture of Weybridge but this is the

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,480
first known use of Open Street Map in

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,050
Wikipedia so basically is at the end

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,250
just screenshot at openstreetmap

00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,530
downloaded image and stuck it to a

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,360
Wikipedia article but of course you can

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,210
use the awesome data itself to create

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,150
your own maps so here you got the

00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:50,310
coastline and raw data and use it to

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,510
generate an SVG map of Macau also OS

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,210
empowers the Wikimedia Foundation

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,460
scarlet Aryan map tile service but just

00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,380
used by the heart aquifer media wiki

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,180
extension and almost all other

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,890
interactive maps and Wikimedia projects

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,560
so basically if you see in an

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,760
interactive map on Wikimedia Project

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,820
chances are it uses this plugin so it's

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,700
extensively used in the wikivoyage

00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:17,100
projects and the Wikimedia Foundation

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,739
recently released internationalized map

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,910
tiles for caret area this leverages

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:27,090
OSM's name tags in different languages

00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:30,360
so here you can see a map of Tokyo using

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,640
English language tags Wikimedia atlas

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,920
and although we media wiki plug-in still

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,930
in use in many Wikipedia's it's also

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,260
powered by awesome data including 3d

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,620
building data so here's a dynamic map

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,660
showing 3d building data in Hong Kong

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,250
and which data items and places can link

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,940
to awesome relations using the OSM

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,010
relation ID property in a similar way

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,280
wiki did we create items about features

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,830
can link to equivalent or some features

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,600
using the OSM tag or key property so

00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,200
here's a wiki data item for a lighthouse

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,850
and it links to the OSM tag man-made

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,989
equals lighthouse so something

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,150
collaborations that have happened

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,420
between Wikimedia or some communities or

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,980
research are some examples map box uses

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,400
wiki data to help with the localization

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:25,110
of the map products so if for example a

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,200
place node or TOI doesn't have the

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,360
a complete name curves it posed us these

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:36,540
labels from corresponding wiki data

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:38,400
items urea toxin created so Fox is part

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,340
of endpoint that combines with idiot and

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,750
awesome currently this is not online but

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:49,920
well he's looking for sponsors to help

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:52,020
power this service Wikimedia Indonesia

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,270
in the hot Indonesia share resources an

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:59,310
organized joint projects such as the

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,990
open content in Kalimantan and finally

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,460
we communicate the Italia is the local

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,120
charter of both the Wikimedia Foundation

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,500
in the awesome foundation so aside from

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,100
hosting and organizing state of the map

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,530
now which media Talia has been helping

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,650
organize awesome I team awesome

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:19,790
corporates in Italy

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:22,230
so some challenges of course we cannot

00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:25,610
import coordinates from our semantic

00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:28,770
data because of incompatible license

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,870
also awesome will not import data from

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:34,020
wicked data despite the cc0 license

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:36,990
because of provenance issues related to

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,190
Google Maps there's some pushback from

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,680
the awesome community against industry

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:44,580
indiscriminate while tagging of more

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,410
wicked at attacks into osm and finally

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,850
we guess internally internationalized

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,950
maps has resorted to concern in the

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:54,540
community that users me at unnecessary

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:56,400
name dives into OS m so map bosses

00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,760
approach of using wiki data labels might

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,880
actually be a better better solution so

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,160
that's it that's a very quick random

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,510
London of things that alright it's

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,590
happening with we go some Ukrainian

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,590
