okay good mommy I'm Alexandra Crowe from

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,300
siege I'm gonna present you project

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,429
mapping project you need to map the

00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,680
water distribution network in Freetown

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,439
it's a one-year project we are just

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,830
finalizing so I'm gonna try to make it

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,359
short just a word about Cece she

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,349
specialized in mapping and virtual

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,080
reality based in you above since 2012 we

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,820
are about six people international team

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,850
and customers and you can check out

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,960
check it out on our website for more

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,180
information

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,770
we are also a member of OpenStreetMap

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,379
morocco and opposite map africa so this

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,500
project is about the physical mapping of

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,399
the distribution system of the goomar

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,520
Valley Water Company which will run the

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,340
water networks in it Freetown and the

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,710
data will be used for modeling purposes

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,460
and condition assessment purposes so

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,280
this is guma very water company logo and

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:12,750
the project has been founded by MCC you

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:18,049
and yes and suitable subcontractor for

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:21,950
the smek company just a word about

00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:25,860
Freetown filters in Sierra Leone in West

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:28,380
Africa small country in West Africa it's

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,290
very one of the most one of the poorest

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,740
country of Africa I think it suffered by

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:38,520
civil war and Ebola and landslides and

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,970
yeah and try to recover from all of this

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,579
it's also known for its beautiful

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,840
beaches on the bright side on the bright

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:53,670
side so our mission in this mapping

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:57,240
exercise was to map the pipes up to 100

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,210
millimeters so obviously everything is

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,759
buried so you can as you can see it's

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,310
it's quite difficult to find the pipes

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,369
we also mapped all the network

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,259
components like advanced reservoirs bars

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,230
and so on so this is my drain for

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,940
example

00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:18,099
we awfully didn't have to map what we

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,670
call the spaghetti pipes which is all

00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:23,920
the informal network which is picked on

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:27,430
the under Goomba very wet up a company

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,420
pipes so we just mapped them as a point

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,910
of take points and we also had to map

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,400
the encroaching structures which are the

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:41,980
constructions within one meter of the

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:45,910
pipe network so how did we do this so we

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:49,989
put it in place 100% of Persons software

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:52,930
architecture with the Postgres post GIS

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:55,930
database using QGIS for the QGIS

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:59,100
software for the GIS software and cue

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:02,200
field for the for the data correction

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,450
all of this has to be mapped as plus on

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,459
one meter level accuracy so we used

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:14,769
superior accuracy genesis devices and

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:17,920
connected with bluetooth taps and we had

00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:21,640
up to 11 mappers mapping the water

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,540
network at the same time so how did you

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,600
how did we use the OpenStreetMap data to

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,209
do this physical mapping exercise first

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,190
as you can see on this picture so the

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,150
the OpenStreetMap database in Freetown

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:39,549
is very rich because a lot of NGOs are

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,670
working in in Freetown so they are all

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:46,510
using the Open Street Map database so

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:53,310
the the the Open Street Map data is very

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:56,220
rich on freedom so

00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:00,360
we used the open signal data for two

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:05,340
main purposes first one was the base map

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:08,340
so we used OpenStreetMap data to embed

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:12,840
stood at the base map on the tabs so we

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,060
had 70 for data collection zones we

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,480
downloaded the OpenStreetMap data base

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:26,340
as raster and we splitted this raster in

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:28,950
this 74 zones to be able to embed one

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:33,090
data correction Zone at a time on the

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:36,960
tab because we had like low capacity 8

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:42,000
gigabytes tabs so yes we needed a light

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:47,280
base maps and these pieces of base map

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,960
were also used to delimit 8 the the the

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,390
area to map for the mappers second

00:04:51,960 --> 00:05:00,960
purposes was to map the encroaching

00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:03,210
structures of on the water network so to

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,950
map the encroaching structures we add

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:10,680
two two ways to do this first when to

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:13,410
pop the mapper where on the on the field

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:18,600
there were mapping encroaching parts of

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:20,940
the pipes as line drawn and snapped on

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,520
the pipes as you can see these are the

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:28,020
blue pipes and you have the uncut parts

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:32,580
in a range here but as you can see also

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:35,400
on this figure we have pipe processing

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,729
buildings that have not been mapped on

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:42,060
the field by the mappers so second way

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:47,760
was to cross the pipes with the building

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:52,020
layer in OpenStreetMap as you can see on

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:55,169
this on this figure the OpenStreetMap

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,900
data has to be checked and improved so

00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:02,090
it's far to be perfect as you can see on

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:05,900
this on this image with the big image

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:10,560
satellite image as

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:13,050
so to do so we hired we concede on the

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,710
our OpenStreetMap Africa community and

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:21,090
we hired to use mappers from the

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:27,599
scenario from the Chilean Sierra Leonean

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:31,289
chapter so this is the the meter deputy

00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:33,449
we we use so we had the data in the

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:36,060
OpenStreetMap data base and we extracted

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:39,629
the buildings private gardens schools

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,639
hospitals in the spheres because the

00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:44,430
purpose for Guevara water company is

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:48,779
that if they have to do an intervention

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,550
on a pipe if it's a private and private

00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,129
property so they have to ask the

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,439
authorization so it's not just about the

00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:59,400
buildings but also the gardens etc etc

00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:02,400
so we extracted all these items and on

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,129
the other side we took the encroachments

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:11,360
we had in the GIS database and also the

00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:16,379
pipes and we crossed this data with QGIS

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,689
to find the potential in questions so

00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,960
this potential in consequence as we call

00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:28,250
them have been Calif ID by the use

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:30,960
mappers using gos M and so we could

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:33,270
bring up the verified and Coachman's

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,490
into the GIS database and the

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,810
OpenStreetMap database has been improved

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:43,349
as the data has been checked and

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:45,659
modified by the newspapers second step

00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:50,789
of this methodology was to retrieve all

00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:54,419
these confirmed and questions and to

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:57,180
retrieve them into the GIS database so

00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:00,089
here is the the result of this job and

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,740
extract of the database so in in pepper

00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:02,729
you have the encroaching structures we

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,909
identified

00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:08,660
so the to use mappers were trained on

00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:10,820
GSM they created

00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,250
six thousand six hundred buildings and

00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,830
then modified more than two thousand and

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,320
at the end we could retrieve three

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,210
thousand and eight hundred and coaching

00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,580
structures on the water networks of

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,890
Freetown

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:29,430
thank you for integer

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:29,430
