Title: Panel: Sustainability of OSM Mapping Projects
Publication date: 2018-09-22
Playlist: SotM 2018, Day 2, De Donato
Description: 
	Erica Hagen (GFDRR/World Bank), State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/S005-Sustainability_of_OSM_Mapping_Projects

Many local groups have arisen to work specifically on mapping in communities in resource-constrained locations around the world. Many global organizations have also undertaken projects in the international development context that seek to collect map data while at the same time supporting the growth of the local OSM community. Improving OSM maps for humanitarian, development, and democracy purposes has become an imperative. However, sustaining these efforts has been difficult to achieve.

This panel will frame the issue of sustainability of mapping groups and map data globally. What does being sustainable mean for an OSM community? Participants will share stories about a particular challenge theyâ€™ve faced in keeping their efforts going, from various vantage points in the OSM global ecosystem. The format will be short presentations followed by a talk show style discussion. Panelists will focus on key tensions such as maintaining data quality vs. attracting new mappers; operating in a very resource-constrained environment; the role of INGOs and international support; different levels of engagement from governmental to grassroots. How can we promote knowledge sharing and mentorship across communities? Borrowing from Wikimedia, we will look at the social, political, technical, and economic barriers preventing people from accessing and contributing to free knowledge.

hello everyone this panel will be led by

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,410
Erica Hagen and they will talk about

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:22,890
sustainability of our Sun mapping

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:25,920
project Thanks okay so I'm not going to

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,650
say too much to begin with but just a

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,710
brief introduction and as you can see we

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,360
have five panelists so we want to make

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:39,750
time to hear from everybody and also

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:42,000
discuss so we will all be brief so I

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,399
started looking at the topic of

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,940
sustainability as we're calling it

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,899
within openstreetmap mapping projects as

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:55,530
part of something called open cities so

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,899
the World Bank's one of the World Bank's

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,030
organ internal organizations on

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,770
resilience has a project called open

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,049
cities and it has to do with Open Street

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,810
Map in different countries around the

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,220
world for projects that are happening in

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,040
those countries usually funded by the

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,920
World Bank as well and there they've

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:19,680
just launched one series in several

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,380
African cities and so I am doing a bit

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,900
of research around how mapping groups in

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,400
different countries have sustained

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,770
themselves or not sustained themselves

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,450
and what challenges have come up so that

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,570
hopefully we can learn from everybody's

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,900
experience so in case I should also

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,710
introduce myself I'm Erica Hagen and I

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:45,149
in 2009 I started a project with my

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,149
partner called map Kibera so we started

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:51,479
working in Kibera slum area of Nairobi

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,100
and it's been several years now and I'm

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,310
still working there we formed an

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,860
organization there locally I work on a

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,200
daily basis with mappers using Open

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,360
Street Map that come from that initial

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,219
project and it's now an organization

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,819
doing different kinds of work mostly in

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,160
Kenya and I've thought a lot of the

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,180
about this topic of you know if you go

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,250
in and train people to do math math

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,200
being what happens next how are they

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,700
benefiting how are they continuing to be

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:25,120
engaged so that's why this topic was

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,459
very close to me and I wanted to also

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,319
see how everybody else has addressed it

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,030
or not addressed it and the challenges

00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,650
that they've faced so that's what

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,810
everyone's going to talk about primarily

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,329
focusing on the biggest challenge that

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:42,340
they've had doing their work in

00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:43,719
different countries and it was hard for

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,010
me to pick then I gave them that

00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,870
assignment and it's really hard for me

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:52,389
to pick what our biggest challenge has

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:54,150
been as map Kabira but you know I think

00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:56,590
a lot of it has to do with maintaining

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,379
participation over a long period of time

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,590
we've now been active for almost like

00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,669
for nine years and there's a few people

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,290
who have stayed with it from the

00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:08,169
beginning who are very devoted who are

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,689
actually staff now but in terms of the

00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:13,689
bigger osm community in Kenya I think

00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:15,459
that we've kind of failed in that regard

00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:17,079
and that's kind of what I'm taking away

00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:19,900
from state of the map also that we could

00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:27,190
grow it much bigger as a whole Kenya

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:30,129
community so that's my piece so I put on

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,500
the screen knowledge equity this concept

00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:35,889
because I thought it kind of underlies a

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,139
lot of our work working in Kenya and a

00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:41,260
lot of people's work in developing

00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:45,220
country contexts so like non-european on

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:47,079
American context but also it ties in

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,540
with this kind of diversity idea that's

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:54,129
been coming up here regarding gender I

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,449
stole this from Wikimedia so I this is

00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:57,459
actually one of their main strategy

00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:00,840
points and some of you from Italy here

00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:03,989
or working on are from it Wikimedia so

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,129
the most important line to me is the

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,470
last line we will break down social

00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:10,000
political and technical barriers that

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,729
prevent people from accessing and

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,239
contributing a free knowledge so if you

00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:17,620
replace knowledge with map it's

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,940
something that I would I think is

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,799
important in OpenStreetMap

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,930
and I know it's not necessarily the

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,479
strategy strategic goal of OpenStreetMap

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,420
right now but the fact that it's a free

00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,480
and open map

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,340
and that supposedly anyone can access it

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,030
and participate in creating the data is

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:39,080
really fundamental so that sort of

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:41,120
underlies my my work with OSM and I

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,220
loved seeing it written as the actual

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:49,340
goal so I hope we can discuss this

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:51,590
further over the weekend no I'm like so

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,480
at so far in the research part that I

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,030
was talking about around sustainability

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,040
I just wanted to present just a tiny bit

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,110
of what we've come up with so far in

00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,980
terms of breaking down this topic like

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,690
what does it actually mean for

00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,750
OpenStreetMap to have a sustainable

00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:08,000
mapping community in countries or

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,760
sustainable mapping organization does it

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,860
mean sustainable data of because map

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,330
data gets old really fast when changes

00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,370
are happening and you need to keep that

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:20,360
sustainable so the maps are actually

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:23,210
accurate in terms of the so we thought

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,090
of it in sort of levels there's like how

00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,140
does the individual map or engage with

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,180
OpenStreetMap can they keep doing it

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,710
just the basic of like can they keep

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,040
doing it over time what do they need in

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,930
order to keep engaged besides just a

00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,870
willingness you know what else might

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,790
they need local organizations that's the

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,280
main one that I've focused on with the

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,290
map Kabira projects how can that be

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,530
sustainable what how can we access

00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:51,350
resources that are needed local

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,680
ecosystems like the Kenya ecosystem you

00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:56,240
know if if OpenStreetMap in it or if map

00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,800
Kibera went away would there still be

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,370
people doing OpenStreetMap like how

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,620
vibrant is the ecosystem in each country

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,510
then there's governmental looking at it

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,610
from that level is the government using

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,990
OpenStreetMap is the local government

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,820
using it is the national government

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:15,230
using it are they just even aware at all

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:17,090
that it exists in many cases no so

00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:19,940
that's not very sustainable in terms of

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:23,270
keeping the map active institutional

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,670
just looking a step larger maybe it's

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,800
international NGOs using OpenStreetMap

00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,380
or something to that effect and global

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,600
is what we're doing here looking at the

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,760
whole global OpenStreetMap and how can

00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,570
it be how can we keep engaging people

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,570
and keep mapping

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,370
and in so in the different countries

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,710
where all of us on this panel are

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,230
working there's a lot of ways people

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,780
have tried to be sustainable by forming

00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,370
a local NGO that's often a something

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:56,780
that people immediately try to do

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:59,210
somehow or accompany a business maybe

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,490
they try to affiliate a chapter with the

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,940
youth mappers program or an Open Street

00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,010
Map chapter fiscal sponsorship I haven't

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,770
seen as much but they could become part

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:13,070
of like an AI hub type of like a lab

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,780
type of setting or tech hub maybe they

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,990
just do individual consulting they find

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,790
out that you know NGOs are interested in

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,340
using OpenStreetMap and they become

00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,350
hired to do it maybe they just have

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,880
there's an original founding project and

00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,120
they just keep working with it you'll

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,280
probably hear some examples of that

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,720
maybe they're in the government or they

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,850
join the government in order to work on

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,830
mapping and maybe they're just

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,300
volunteers so I put that kind of last

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,960
and we've been talking about a little

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,940
bit over the past day or I have been and

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,590
there's a little bit of in in a lot of

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,940
the countries that we're talking about

00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,460
it's very hard to just do pure

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,110
volunteerism but is it possible how does

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:55,460
it how does that for a piece of the

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:57,490
puzzle and these are some things that

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,250
might be needed or a way to break down

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,530
what each group might have like do they

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,850
they need resources that could be people

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,920
that could be equipment that could be

00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,080
funding they need somebody with the

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,740
technical skills they need possibly some

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,090
kind of organizing principle and they

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,540
need networks they need to be joined up

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:19,610
with this greater community of osm so

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:25,250
that's just that's a very cursory

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:28,760
explanation so now I'm going to move on

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:31,220
to the panelists so each person is just

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,690
going to speak for five minutes I might

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,120
have to jump up and down or something

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:39,330
if you run if you're going way over I'll

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:42,419
be like okay so keep an eye on me

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,300
and basically I'll let them introduce

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,830
themselves one-by-one and they'll tell

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,839
you a little bit about what they do and

00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,970
what country and how you know how long

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,980
they've been doing it for and mainly I

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,260
wanted each of them to highlight one of

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,180
their main challenges that has been hard

00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,779
for them in terms of the sustainability

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,950
of what they're working on

00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:04,740
so we'll just go down the length start

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,560
with Janet please introduce yourself as

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,060
ma'am hi I am so I'm Janet Chapman and

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,040
for the last five years I've been a

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,860
full-time volunteer for Tanzania

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,240
Development Trust which is an entirely

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,220
volunteer run charity that's been in

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,130
operation for 43 years supporting

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,730
grassroots projects in rural Tanzania

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,800
so around three years ago when as I was

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,440
visiting projects in rural Tanzania I

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,110
realized that they were not any map

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,430
which seemed to me to be a ridiculous

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:38,970
problem in the 21st century so I started

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:43,310
crowd to map and since then so crowd map

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:46,200
is an entirely volunteer organization

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,959
the vast majority of our volunteer

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,220
online volunteers have come through UN

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:56,700
online volunteering so we have around

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:59,610
8,000 volunteers we have around 1,600

00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,850
people in the slack channel of remote

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,190
mappers so building building and

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,350
sustaining the online community of

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,649
remote mappers I would say is relatively

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:16,140
easy it's much much harder to sustain

00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:20,430
the field mappers on the ground so we've

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:26,060
been working very closely with hot in

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:28,500
Tanzania and externally we've we

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,680
operation was completely transformed

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,339
when we got a hot micro grants around a

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,890
year ago prior to that we were just

00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:41,730
relying on volunteers with using their

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:45,000
own phones which was very skewed towards

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,520
men because in the villages smartphones

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,950
are

00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,680
fairly rare anyway and they're generally

00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:54,830
controlled by men so having that the

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,130
grants made a big difference we've since

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,350
it also allowed us to run training in

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,960
various different ask various different

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:06,710
areas of rural Tanzania to train train

00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:09,680
up people who are adding local details

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:13,310
using maps dot me mostly and also field

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:17,210
papers to an extent so our biggest

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:19,340
challenge really now is having small

00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:22,550
amounts of funding to character carry on

00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:25,730
field mapping generally so we're working

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:30,140
with very marginalized groups like

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:33,980
subsistence farmers and although we

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:38,030
never we've never paid per diems people

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:41,200
do need some local transport costs but

00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:47,710
took to actually travel around and map

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:50,270
so how we've how we try to work is by

00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,490
linking as much as possible with other

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,830
organizations that are working in

00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:58,160
Tanzania so forth so try and engage

00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:02,660
people like voluntary service overseas

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:08,780
Peace Corps Tanzania Red Cross local

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:12,530
government etc and also other NGOs such

00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:16,640
as so with we've been particularly

00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:19,460
focused on the fight against FGM so

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,370
we've engaged a lot of FGM female

00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:26,390
genital mutilation activists but also

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,400
two other large organizations such as

00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,730
Plan International Save the Children to

00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:36,050
try and persuade their volunteers in the

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:38,050
field to to get involved so I would say

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:44,069
that we're entirely of volunteerism

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:46,839
woman project so yep

00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:50,739
great and I'll just ask one follow-up

00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:52,300
question so what would you say are sort

00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:54,069
of the differences between engaging

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,970
these different groups so you said you

00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:59,619
work with human rights groups versus any

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,149
other kinds of groups that you tend to

00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:03,369
work with and do this everybody that

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:07,509
you're engaging tend to have a job of

00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:12,269
some sort already yes I mean I guess the

00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:16,360
idea is to convince groups that that

00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:21,369
mapping helps whatever they're trying to

00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,860
do so the majority so we have local

00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:28,889
mapping groups and they generally

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:31,389
they're run by a community activist who

00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:33,220
sees the benefit of maps from their

00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:35,559
community and that could be in

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:39,939
protecting girls from FGM but it could

00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:42,449
be in convincing donors that they're the

00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:45,730
secondary school needs a hostel because

00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:49,629
girls have extremely long walks to

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:52,649
school or it could be that they need

00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:55,899
better access to water so all of those

00:13:52,649 --> 00:14:01,509
problems that need a map as the first

00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:03,309
stage so we try to engage people to get

00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:06,929
involved because they can see a direct

00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:13,269
benefit for them and their community

00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:13,869
great okay let's move on to Jeffrey yeah

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,369
thank you

00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:21,369
so my name is Jeffrey Catterick from

00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:24,490
Uganda I work with humanitarian office

00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:28,089
map team project in Eve and Martin for

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:33,179
if it is I'm also chairman of map Uganda

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:36,069
which is a local NGO OpenStreetMap so

00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:38,949
and I've been building that for some

00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:43,389
good time now just one quickly share

00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:45,669
with you like my awesome story how did I

00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:46,360
get involved so I got involved in

00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:50,949
OpenStreetMap

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,150
and around 2012 so that's when I was at

00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:55,060
University and

00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:59,050
there was a pasta called mud mapping

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:01,950
challenge so I was intrigued and wanted

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,870
but spit so but spirit in the challenge

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:09,040
so there was an organization and in gon

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:11,800
Kampala cod fruits of thought which a

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,170
consisted of awesome community in Uganda

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,740
and when I persuaded in this challenge

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:20,080
Anna was one of the winners so we had a

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:24,490
project called mapping day which

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:27,250
involved moving around the country on a

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:31,320
bus like making stops and training

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:33,280
University students on how to

00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,450
OpenStreetMap and like rating like

00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,320
mapping groups are different

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:41,080
universities and then after that

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:44,020
continually having mapping parties and

00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:48,250
map Athens in Kampala and then that's

00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:50,740
when I go to learn about Hajj which also

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:54,580
made me more interested because I

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:57,250
realized then I can contribute to open

00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:02,020
street map as a way of helping out other

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:05,170
people in need then the different

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,930
projects started off like in Tanzania

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:10,240
Romani Korea got to work on that and

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,930
then more mapping projects that are

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,900
happening in Kampala so on the way after

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,210
I like you know engaging with several

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,190
mappers in the country before we thought

00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:25,240
that there was a need to you know create

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:27,220
a local organization to to try to

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,370
structure our activities and grow the

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:33,970
community and that's when we registered

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:36,430
map Uganda as an organization we are

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,970
like in our second year now and I can

00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:44,350
say we have been able to you know do a

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,630
few projects two of them now one Bank

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:53,310
project another one called a clean

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:56,460
streets and I can say one of the

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:59,920
concealer challenges is

00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:02,080
we have people that get introduced

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,750
OpenStreetMap in different ways in the

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,080
community so some people get to know

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,020
about

00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,970
OpenStreetMap like at in mapathon when

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,000
they see pasta someone come to

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,860
contribute others when you are going to

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,470
be a project in a certain area and then

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:22,630
you try to recruit people

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:26,560
so like the people's view of opens map

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:28,870
like like what keeps them to continue

00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,270
mapping so someone has been paid to

00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:34,420
contribute on a project and someone who

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:36,310
came to volunteer their time so it's

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,670
interesting to see who of the two

00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:43,510
continues to map and why why do they

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:46,180
continue to map is quite very important

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,850
to when introducing two people

00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:52,060
OpenStreetMap to tell them this is a

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:55,210
volunteer opportunity and they can like

00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:58,600
take this on and try to start off it off

00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:06,750
like in their own communities and grow

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:10,800
the map so as a bit about canvas great

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,800
let's just continue down the line

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:26,140
the South also known as ribbon I'm from

00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:30,500
Bangladesh I have been working with

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:33,170
OpenStreetMap for a while now working

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,870
with the community trying to coordinate

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:41,020
the community help coordinate the

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:42,820
community I would rather say I have

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:48,410
joined

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:51,200
OSM initially I was supposed to be a

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:53,780
translator with with the missing maps

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:58,460
project where Yura K and Pete was there

00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:00,350
in Bangladesh but afterwards when I went

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,480
to the training session I found out I

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:06,140
would rather be a mapper rather than it

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:11,630
translated over there it was interesting

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:16,760
for the beginning and after after

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:18,680
afterwards what I saw were there that

00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,500
there has been a lot of volunteer

00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:24,410
students and others people are engaged

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:28,100
in it I found it interesting and started

00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:33,070
working with it soon becomes very much

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:38,540
those with the community and somehow

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:41,570
painting in a position where I am

00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:44,360
more or less contributing to the

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:47,980
community as more of a coordinating the

00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,510
volunteers and stuffs have been with

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:56,330
most of the projects out there in

00:19:50,510 --> 00:20:01,400
Bangladesh afterwards but one thing I

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:03,800
just found out that the main challenge

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,810
as everyone was mentioning main

00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,860
challenge was to sustain the volunteers

00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:13,100
out there because most of the cases in

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:15,790
our part of the country volunteers in

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,340
open not only in OpenStreetMap in every

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,980
sector volunteers are coming from the

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,710
education

00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:27,510
Institute most of them are students and

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:31,170
some are there who are being in other

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:34,600
things and work and other things to do

00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:36,100
but as I mentioned that almost 80% of

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,520
the volunteers are coming from the

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:43,720
student level it is hard for them to

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:46,990
continue afterwards we have a vibe I

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:50,470
have most of the cases people are saying

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,390
in Bangladesh OpenStreetMap community is

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:56,310
the most vibrant one of the most vibrant

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:59,950
communities in the world in the globally

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:03,540
if you go through the statistics you

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:06,940
will see in the top list you will find

00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:11,020
almost eighteen to twenty volunteers who

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:13,750
has been contributing a lot in a way but

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,230
their total main situation over there to

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:19,060
sustain them in that field is very much

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:24,000
hard because most of them are not from

00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:26,860
geographical geographic background some

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,300
I would say one or two percent of the

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,260
people are coming from the geographic

00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:33,640
background over there others we are

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,070
coming from the diverse background from

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,080
business backgrounds from engineering

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:42,190
backgrounds and other backgrounds so

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,590
after finishing this their educational

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,010
life their main focus is their carrier

00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:53,470
how their carrier path is going on and

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:56,170
how to have this capacity helping them

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:59,500
out with their future carrier - so as

00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:04,300
their their main focus remains as the

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:06,960
carriers most of the cases after one or

00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:10,570
two months doing going with

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,870
OpenStreetMap they have their passion

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:16,960
but at the end of the day practical

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:20,380
things comes first they they just don't

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:24,640
find any relation to their carrier track

00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:27,870
with the mapping things so what we have

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,840
seen in most of the cases

00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:36,400
while there is projects with the aid

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,770
agencies and other organizations there

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,930
are volunteers available but whenever

00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:44,320
projects are not there we always found

00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:49,710
out that people are not continuing

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:53,770
mapping so we try to change these things

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:56,890
that piece became the more more

00:22:53,770 --> 00:23:01,560
challenging for us to have people

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:04,300
constantly keep this consistency of

00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:08,170
working with OpenStreetMap contributing

00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:12,210
and also thinking about thinking a bit

00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:17,110
innovatively how osm can be implemented

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:22,840
with the application application part I

00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:27,430
would rather and another thing

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:32,380
whoever working with OpenStreetMap in

00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:35,320
Bangladesh you might have many of you

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,960
might have known as a mohawk from World

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:43,360
Bank he has been working since the very

00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:45,520
beginning but most of the cases he what

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,650
his experience was he was saying that he

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,260
has trained more than 4,000 volunteers

00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,600
out there and all of a sudden whenever

00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:55,120
new projects coming in he couldn't find

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,310
a single volunteer who will be jumping

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,830
in to volunteer with the projects and

00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:03,370
fresh batch of volunteers needed to be

00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:06,070
trained up and work with those things so

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:08,740
leadership is not coming out in a in a

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,930
sense because if every time you have you

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:14,380
need to rely on the fresh volunteers out

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:17,800
there to work on you have to go through

00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,720
the basic things not in technical

00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,980
perspective it is not improving that

00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,260
much but now the situation is a bit

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,520
change as humanitarian OpenStreetMap

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,800
team hot has been

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,710
brilliantly helping us out with some

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,640
device grants and other things missing

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:44,050
maps constantly helping us out with the

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,970
thoughts and some sort of training it

00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,850
would say online trainings and other

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:54,010
things

00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:59,680
another thing comes up that is the main

00:24:54,010 --> 00:25:04,300
challenge I say the transition from I -

00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:07,150
we most of the people are more focused

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:10,000
on their personal interests rather than

00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:14,410
overall community base interests over

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:19,450
there so we are trying to find out a way

00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:22,330
to more community focused coordination

00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,910
part rather than individual consultants

00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:27,880
coming up with the projects and people

00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:31,450
are involving in it because if we want

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,130
to sustain the platform over there there

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,950
need to be some applications so what

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:38,200
they are coming from the community and

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:40,720
also some ideas coming from the

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,930
community who are thinking about

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,940
building of something based on boys and

00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:51,930
OpenStreetMap so there's the part we are

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:51,930
working on right now thank you

00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,530
let's move on to Laura first how about

00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,510
and Laura's can you can introduce

00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:07,150
yourself as well in a similar way in the

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:11,680
mobile chat i'm laura i'm a student in

00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:16,960
nairobi kenya and I'm passing a degree

00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:18,870
in geomatics engineering and yes so I'm

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,690
involved in OpenStreetMap and the

00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:27,630
pannier is my first lead for

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:31,539
my first chapter in the university so I

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:35,350
said I'm passionate about basically tech

00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:36,880
OSM and open data and how we can

00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:39,429
integrate all of this to provide

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,220
solutions to real world problems in

00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:44,740
their third world countries so basically

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:47,230
what we've done is we've been able to

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:51,720
work on a couple of projects around

00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:55,809
Kenya especially the u.s. aid projects

00:26:51,720 --> 00:27:00,909
PEPFAR projects Indians that concentrate

00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:05,049
on women and HIV and AIDS and such so I

00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:08,020
would say when when I think of the issue

00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:11,320
of sustainability in the youth mothers

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:14,580
chapter content context I tend to lean

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:20,200
on thinking about impact and growth so

00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:22,840
so we tend to see on how many students

00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,390
in the university are aware about open

00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,730
data free and open source software and

00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:30,880
all that and how they can actually use

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,120
this to provide solutions to problems

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,450
that they're facing on a community level

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:42,070
so to do this what we do is mainly work

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:46,299
with organizations so say but luckily

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:48,130
and and on a global level so maybe if

00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:50,679
they have a project within the country

00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:54,070
within the community able to help them

00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:56,140
with them then supposed to say provide

00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:59,200
funding to just for the training

00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,820
sessions and all that so I'd say that

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,720
should be the main challenge that you've

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,470
been facing just finding the

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,179
organizations that are willing to

00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:12,190
partner with us and all that but through

00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:13,380
the good planning and all that we were

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,300
able to assist

00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,790
and support from various organizations

00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,890
and others yeah

00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:25,020
so currently what you're working on is

00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:29,730
for our youth Papa's chapter we were

00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:33,420
working when we are creating a Arad

00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:36,600
management system for Kenya so cause

00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,980
mainly if you come in Kenya notice that

00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,600
some of the roads are in a very bad

00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:44,820
state and what the government says is

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,090
they cannot provide funding to collect

00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,160
data on there are defects and then need

00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:55,140
finding again to do the maintenance so

00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:57,420
it's done in a half hazard grace so what

00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,240
you're doing is you're trying to see how

00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,730
we can use participatory mapping is in

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:07,080
social media and all that and collecting

00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:10,110
data from Twitter and just pulling in so

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:14,010
so many data sources that are open and

00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:15,990
all that yeah Laura maybe I can just ask

00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,910
one follow-up question I know that you

00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:22,860
said you started out with the youth

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:25,050
mappers chapter and what about the

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,690
sustainability of like a chapter like a

00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:32,730
university chapter such as youth mappers

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:37,440
in your particular University so as I

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:39,630
had said earlier for us since you are

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,440
working on other projects what you just

00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:46,590
need is say access to funding to be able

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,990
to say fine that we need to help map

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:52,670
Athens do training sessions and all that

00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:55,290
and that can be a bit tough considering

00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,720
there's not so much support from the

00:29:55,290 --> 00:30:00,210
University itself and all that so you

00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,150
have to look for when you have to get

00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:06,320
access to the Internet you have to

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:09,300
convince people to to attend this and

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,430
also I don't know if it's this is all

00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:14,430
around the world but mostly right now in

00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,310
universities in Kenya mostly people are

00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:18,250
looking for opportunities that will

00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:22,750
bring in

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:26,470
or money and that so you have to try and

00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:28,750
convince someone that this that I will

00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:31,690
be able to use it in another context and

00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,520
it's really available it may not

00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,010
necessarily bring the person

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,559
individually say money or something of

00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:40,539
the sort but it can be used later clear

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,750
indirectly in another context to

00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:46,690
generate finances and sustain a whole

00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:49,419
community through say the provision of

00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:52,120
jobs and all that so I'd say that's also

00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:55,360
an issue within the chapter itself just

00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,220
trying to convince people to participate

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,830
in this and just drink to explain to

00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:10,270
them like the impact of open data and

00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:14,289
all that yeah hi everyone I'm Cheryl

00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:18,059
Evans I work at US aid and also a count

00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,059
co-founder of the youth mappers program

00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:27,520
which I work on with Patricia Solis here

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:29,950
I would say one of the biggest

00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,640
challenges that we face so so part of my

00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:35,260
job at USAA is to find places where USA

00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,539
is working that could benefit from

00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,390
Geographic data that's what we do at the

00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:42,309
Gio Center and then you know I engage

00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:46,360
with the OSM community to create that

00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:50,409
that and then help us a partners use

00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:53,830
that data to help inform decisions so

00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:58,600
there's plenty of need there to take on

00:31:53,830 --> 00:32:01,690
that work but where where what we're

00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,150
running up against is resources to help

00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:06,250
manage this rapidly growing network of

00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,809
youth mappers chapters you know this

00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:12,549
started as a concept a couple years ago

00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:14,010
sort of as a little pilot project it's

00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:15,210
taken off in a big way

00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:19,620
it's

00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:22,220
you know exceeded our expectations but

00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,870
you know how do you continue to engage a

00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,929
network of a hundred and twenty

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:29,820
universities in 36 countries when you

00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:32,610
didn't plan for that from the beginning

00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:35,940
we also run into some of the same

00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:38,429
challenges with training students as you

00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,230
mentioned in Bangladesh you know since

00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:42,840
we are working with university students

00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:45,419
you know they come and they go

00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,730
so sustaining chapters we rely on the

00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:50,750
students and their mentoring professors

00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:53,610
to continue keeping these chapters going

00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,990
but there's a lot of you know mapathon

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:58,760
swear you're giving a basic level

00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:01,460
training but then how do we get those

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,779
few students who are really into

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,870
OpenStreetMap and take them to the next

00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:08,640
level you know get them validating some

00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:11,309
of the map data get them out in the

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,440
field collecting some of those points of

00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:17,570
interests and other detailed information

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,570
that helps enrich the quality of the map

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,059
so so training has been it's just

00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:26,490
consistent work and the larger the

00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:28,500
network grows the more basic level

00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:31,710
training you have to do and we have come

00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:35,970
up with some ways to get students beyond

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:38,070
that basic level and then get them as to

00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:40,830
where they can you know take the train

00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:44,070
the trainer's approach to help expand

00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:48,840
that knowledge within the community but

00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:50,669
that is probably one of the biggest

00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,720
challenges also right we all know

00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:55,529
working and in remote parts of the world

00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,210
when you're working on some of these

00:33:55,529 --> 00:33:59,370
projects you have to coordinate amongst

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:02,730
many different groups so it's not calm

00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:06,929
uncommon to work with you know say youth

00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:09,780
mapper students startup company the

00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:13,109
local osm community and maybe an NGO

00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,940
right along with USA so coordinating all

00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:17,159
those pieces of the puzzle and making

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:21,060
sure everyone has what they need and

00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,139
clear direction to move forward thank

00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,980
you

00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:27,629
so many interesting themes have come up

00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:29,249
I've just wanted to call out a couple

00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:30,749
and then maybe some of you have a

00:34:29,249 --> 00:34:32,759
response to each other from what you've

00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:34,019
heard because I think it's interesting I

00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:36,210
don't know if you've all sort of sat and

00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:37,799
talked together about this with each

00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,569
other before and probably other people

00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:43,619
in this room also doing similar things

00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:46,470
in the country there from the role of

00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:49,579
students so it sounds like students have

00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:51,659
come up in four with four of these

00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:54,029
discussions so far and I don't know

00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:57,569
Janet also works with students I work

00:34:54,029 --> 00:35:00,150
with students a little bit through youth

00:34:57,569 --> 00:35:02,640
mappers as well although we started with

00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,769
non students kind of looking for people

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,789
who were really needing skills and

00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:11,369
couldn't go to university but what

00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:13,680
should that be because as Chad mentioned

00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:15,569
students come and go some of you are

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,529
probably students and you can get very

00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:18,180
involved in something when you're in

00:35:16,529 --> 00:35:20,369
university of the time and the dedicated

00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,859
kind of the the whole point of being

00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:26,789
there is to get involved in stuff and

00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:28,650
then afterward how can you sustain that

00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:32,099
involvement in such a way that benefits

00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:35,849
the whole osm basically just keeps the

00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:41,160
map going I don't know if anyone wants

00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:42,900
to speak to that in particular so just

00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,200
write share from our experience in

00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,630
Uganda so you know we believe my past

00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,150
chapters especially someone is at

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:53,609
university and like he's the president

00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:56,519
of this my pal stepped on them he is out

00:35:53,609 --> 00:36:00,539
of the University this is very key to

00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:05,400
get that person involved in the local

00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:08,700
community and if that person is in a

00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,880
country where there is no like organized

00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:16,190
osm group then it's very hard for them

00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:20,730
and what we are trying to do is to grow

00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:23,069
osm Africa which is a network of local

00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,730
osm community from all around Africa to

00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:29,400
try to share and

00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:32,460
experiences and like learn from each

00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:35,730
other so what we are trying to do is

00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,980
also to try to help countries which

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,960
don't have organized localism

00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,810
communities to start up something

00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,600
because like I mentioned when when

00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:48,510
someone is participating in his mobile

00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:51,090
chapter and he's out of university but

00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:55,830
wants to continue so where do they go so

00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:59,280
they can now join efforts as a localism

00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:04,020
community so we need to have like more

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,780
local chapters of Lagos awesome groups

00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,330
from different countries in Africa cuz

00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:13,590
that's still low but this is something

00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:17,120
that can help sustain people who are

00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:20,700
interested in continuing OpenStreetMap

00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:24,420
Thanks I just add the youth mothers have

00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:27,600
been key to development as well so we

00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,080
set up youth mapa chapters at the

00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:34,350
Institute of Rural Development planning

00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:38,250
so and those people when they qualify

00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:41,280
will go back to villages to be village

00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:45,500
educated village executive officers etc

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:50,100
so hopefully that will really be the

00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:51,780
integral in spreading the movement in

00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,090
one of the key challenges that we have

00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,670
also is that we're working in rural

00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:59,300
areas that have additional challenges so

00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,530
I mean students are a relatively

00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,900
privileged group in that obviously

00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:07,380
they're educated and have access to

00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:11,520
education and so on so but I agree that

00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:14,360
they are a key driver in helping to

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,360
build the community

00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:24,680
I just I'll move on to another topic to

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:27,410
pull out so kind of link to that Jeffrey

00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,180
was mentioning osm Africa I guess I you

00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:32,030
know we're here in Italy there was

00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,920
people from osm networks throughout the

00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,690
entire world here and I've been super

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,200
impressed meeting people from everywhere

00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:41,660
in the world here I guess I would like

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,900
to hear some of your thoughts on what

00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,640
the role for the International osm world

00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,660
and the people that are here in this

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,140
room people that are here at this

00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:55,190
conference and sort of mappers that are

00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:58,100
not from your countries should be or how

00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:01,160
you think you know kind of like how you

00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:05,680
think it should look globally I don't

00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,680
know if somebody has a comment on that

00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:17,270
I would rather say like building up

00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:20,510
local communities local foundations as

00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:28,690
awesome Africa Jeffrey was mentioning

00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:30,770
about we're also just developing another

00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,260
coordination group over there in

00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:36,380
Bangladesh in Bangladesh foundation we

00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:40,130
are calling it right now but at the end

00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:44,780
of the day what happens with most of the

00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:46,670
cases even there are a lot of things

00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,750
NGOs aid agencies and other

00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:52,400
organizations are walking in with osm

00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:55,580
projects within the countries in

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,090
different countries what we found out

00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:02,450
that for the specific projects they are

00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:05,270
open to support with everything but at

00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:08,960
the end of the project what happens if

00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:14,600
we want to as Laura was mentioning about

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,230
if local communities want to organize

00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,380
the mapathon

00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:21,380
where should they go question comes up

00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:24,680
we need a venue over there venue is hard

00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,690
to find with internet accessibility and

00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,420
other things keeping and keeping those

00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:32,390
things in mind it is always hard to find

00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:35,900
in those part of the world in those

00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:42,590
cases aid agencies could have helped out

00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:47,060
with infrastructures they have but it is

00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:51,290
a bit very much sorry to say most of the

00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:54,109
cases agencies are not helping the

00:40:51,290 --> 00:41:02,240
communities out out of their projects in

00:40:54,109 --> 00:41:03,440
if it is not being if organisations who

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,829
are working with

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,960
in the international arenas and in the

00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:11,569
national levels

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,950
benefitting with the projects and stuffs

00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:20,359
are not helping out the communities just

00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:24,380
having one or two mapathon say in in for

00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:28,400
the project needs doesn't ensure any

00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:31,730
sort of sustainability or it is not

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,710
helping out the overall OS n platform in

00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:36,530
a big way I would rather say in terms of

00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:39,800
community perspective what people people

00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:42,470
in my community things of the other

00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,589
mappers are there there they are not

00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,210
getting the opportunity to work with

00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:50,990
using those infrastructures later on if

00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:53,980
they have the enthusiasm to work as

00:41:50,990 --> 00:42:00,170
volunteer to they are not finding it out

00:41:53,980 --> 00:42:06,079
I think it is it is one thing we should

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:09,770
focus more on how to have not only a

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:13,670
disease other corporations other

00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:15,800
organizations it can be commercial

00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:18,589
organization it can be government

00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:22,520
organizations can help out in a big way

00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:24,020
there are many infrastructures being

00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:29,660
developed for the government level to

00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:33,140
government level either I city halls are

00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:38,089
there auditoriums are there it can be

00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:41,800
used or if the aid agencies or the other

00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:44,020
agencies have their hall rooms

00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:47,600
allocated for the community for a

00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:50,210
specific timeframe that they can use it

00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:53,390
up and partnering with the communities

00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:57,310
in a way it might help the local

00:42:53,390 --> 00:43:00,860
communities grow up in a bigger way and

00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:04,190
the guys who are working in the

00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:06,850
communities they will feel interested to

00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:10,370
work more on those things up of course

00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:15,110
as I mentioned or most of the guys over

00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:18,080
there are students and they focus on

00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:23,690
their carrier - it is intriguing for

00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:28,460
them to be able to go with a specific

00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:31,460
organization and work within a certain

00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:35,170
thing I would say infrastructures over

00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:38,990
there it is something they feel pride of

00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:41,510
they feel proud to be part of that

00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:44,440
organization he or she might be working

00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:48,350
with that organization feels like that

00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:52,250
sometimes they they take it as the right

00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:55,120
thing and we saw whenever any

00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:58,450
organization is organizing something

00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:01,430
they're coming in a big way but if

00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:04,760
community is calling them out that we're

00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:07,520
going to have things like that we don't

00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:13,730
see that much people coming out over

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:15,700
there to participate in a way but even

00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:21,140
with the youth mapa chapters I would say

00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:24,590
it is hard for the students to organize

00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:28,370
a mapathon straight away if they call it

00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:30,820
out they don't see that much people

00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:33,050
appearing in the

00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:36,770
Janet you want to add something to this

00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:40,040
I think there's three ways that the OSM

00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:43,790
international community can help firstly

00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:46,550
I'll write on an individual level osm

00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:49,580
mappers can help map those places that

00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:53,060
are not matte but not mapped and help so

00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:57,440
help local communities we're also trying

00:44:53,060 --> 00:45:00,830
to partner individual mappers in places

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,830
like this who are linked with community

00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:07,310
groups in Tanzania and who are helping

00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:10,910
creates a printable maps in QGIS for

00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:13,820
example and liaison via email secondly

00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:18,650
you know obviously it's you know it's

00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:22,400
nice to see a relatively diverse crowd

00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:24,710
here from 56 countries but I'm still you

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,820
know places like Africa are very still

00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:30,650
under represented represented and I

00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:34,280
think it's fantastic that there are

00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:37,130
scholarships available but you know that

00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:43,120
could be expanded and then I think

00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:46,070
thirdly mappers who are more experienced

00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:50,150
mapping places that are very well mapped

00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:53,510
should be mindful that some people are

00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:55,040
very coming very new to osm and their

00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:58,250
mapping their communities that are

00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,520
starting from a very low base so they're

00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:04,970
almost starting with a map of nothing

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,760
and so it's a very different context and

00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:10,490
I know as an when I was a new mapper and

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,730
not that long ago you know it's really

00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:18,530
important that the your first feedback

00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:20,420
from the community is positive my

00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:24,620
experience has always been very positive

00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:26,840
within the the mapping community I have

00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:29,750
to say it's been different from in other

00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:34,820
technical communities when if your first

00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:36,750
edit say in Wikipedia for example is you

00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:40,340
get negative feedback when you think

00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:44,880
well I'm not going to do that again so

00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:49,890
be tolerant of initial mistakes and give

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:51,690
positive feedback interesting I'd like

00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:54,570
to see if we have some audience

00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:55,830
questions or comments at this point I

00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:59,910
don't know if there's a couple

00:46:55,830 --> 00:47:01,680
microphones here otherwise yeah please

00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:04,080
feel free to chime in on any of the

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:17,310
topics you've heard there's one here

00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:20,580
there's one here hi given that we all

00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:22,440
recognize the issue of a new project

00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,890
being something that's really exciting

00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:28,110
and it's something that you might get a

00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,820
lot of people that are interested in

00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:31,410
doing something and we all understand

00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:34,680
that human condition that's very new is

00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:38,850
more fun and to sustain something and

00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:44,640
just fix something is not as exciting

00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:48,030
how can us math and people that are

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:51,780
working out in the fields devise their

00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:54,840
local programs such that there is always

00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:59,130
something new and exciting and it's also

00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:01,620
the problem for funders so you know Chad

00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:05,220
was sort of saying you know about you're

00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:09,150
trying to sustain even the youth mappers

00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:12,800
issues how can my experience is that

00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:19,260
funders always look to fund new

00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:22,080
innovative projects they don't like to

00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:25,080
go down the route of sustainability

00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,820
because that's never-ending and it's not

00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:29,460
something that necessarily looks great

00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:33,150
in their grant reports or yeah - they're

00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:35,220
the people that give them money so it's

00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:37,620
the case of if that is the landscape

00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:39,590
that we're working in is it a case that

00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:42,870
we have to think about new ways of

00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:45,210
devising our own programs so that there

00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:46,800
is always something new and interesting

00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:48,450
even if it's and and you know when it

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,570
gets to the stage of I don't know like

00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:55,740
bug fixing or or sound that you have

00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:57,360
slight Sprint's and you incentivize some

00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:03,230
areas that you know are not as

00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:05,940
attractive I just be interested to yeah

00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:09,060
actually I'd be happy to speak to that a

00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:10,950
little bit just I mean I've I've been in

00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:14,760
the position of looking for funding a

00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:16,470
lot and trying to sort of sell what

00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,720
might look like it's the same thing I

00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,430
mean some people say well you're still

00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,970
working on mapping in Kibera why isn't

00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:25,710
it done yet and you know but those of us

00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,600
working on things in place like that

00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:30,060
know that there's like constantly a need

00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:33,930
for updated refreshed or deeper or more

00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:36,150
secretory based or just just there's

00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:39,150
always something new but to sell it as

00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:41,340
new to funders and I mean OpenStreetMap

00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:43,620
didn't arise out of the international

00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:46,770
development and aid sector like that's

00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:49,110
not its origin so I'm kind of trying to

00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:53,280
thinking a bit separate from that even

00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:54,660
though that's my training as well and so

00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,180
I think you bring up a very good point

00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,350
when a lot of people we've had some

00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,810
other discussions where I talk about

00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:03,660
like the origin of the OpenStreetMap

00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:06,660
community in each country how did it

00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:08,880
come to be it has an influence on its

00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:12,210
sustainability down the road so if it if

00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:16,800
it started with a lot of development

00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:18,900
money put into like a big project that's

00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,970
what it that's what people think that

00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,070
OpenStreetMap is maybe and it's hard to

00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,920
change the perception down the road so

00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:27,330
there is maybe a more intentional way

00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,670
with some of the younger communities to

00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:31,740
think about that because even if you got

00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:34,200
you know if there was a lot of funding

00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:36,210
to fund mappers and trainings and stuff

00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,720
and then suddenly it's gone because yeah

00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:43,110
the the project ends and the paid sector

00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,460
is very finicky and fickle so that's I

00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:47,100
think the point where a lot of us

00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,300
sitting here are already at is like okay

00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,430
wait that's not gonna

00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,110
you can't just we can't rely on this

00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:55,590
kind of thing forever and so I know

00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:56,789
there's some efforts to engage more with

00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:59,039
private sector

00:50:56,789 --> 00:51:00,470
which is one thing that I think ribbon

00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:05,760
is going to talk about in another

00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:07,470
session and I'm also thinking and that's

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,660
kind of why I raised this question of

00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:12,960
you know what are there ways to partner

00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:15,510
more with the broader osm world which is

00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:19,440
a lot of people and a lot of people in

00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:21,299
Europe in the u.s. who want to see the

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,000
map grow not only in their own country

00:51:21,299 --> 00:51:29,160
but for everyone so there's also may be

00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,960
an internal possibility for support and

00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,140
it might not be at that level where

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:37,049
you're talking you know good salaries

00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:39,480
for a lot of people in a bunch of

00:51:37,049 --> 00:51:42,359
countries but as Janet was saying very

00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,039
small amounts can be helpful too but

00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:45,900
it's just a matter of actually maybe

00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:48,329
being able to plan ahead and not you

00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:51,809
know like knowing that there's a

00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:54,180
relationship with some kind of either

00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:58,109
donor or actual enterprise private

00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:59,519
enterprise maybe we have five more

00:51:58,109 --> 00:52:00,660
minutes so how about somebody else wants

00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,750
to say something on that and then we

00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:09,809
have another comment question looks like

00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:13,160
a few people have a yeah I can I can say

00:52:09,809 --> 00:52:15,900
something real quick to that on you know

00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,720
putting on the US aid lens but also

00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,859
thinking more holistically

00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:23,220
sustainability of the project I think

00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:25,019
the more the diversity of map users you

00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:27,500
have is really going to help and from

00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:30,480
you know the USA team and terian sector

00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,190
I'm trying to you know promote the use

00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,539
within some of the implementing partners

00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,250
and other people working in that space

00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:36,779
you may not have heard of open truth map

00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:39,539
before but once they do and once they

00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:42,869
see the value in it and using geographic

00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:45,450
data and the map then they're going to

00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:47,279
be willing to invest more resources into

00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,930
maintaining the map and the more users

00:52:47,279 --> 00:52:51,150
that you have and the more the wider

00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:53,039
diversity of users you have I think this

00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:56,809
that's going to overall increase the

00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:56,809
quality of data out there

00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:05,290
the web I was mentioning about the

00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:06,910
things what we were missing right now in

00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:09,850
Bangladesh we have we are trying to

00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:12,610
build up some sort of mechanism of but

00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:15,700
there as I was mentioning we are trying

00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:17,980
to be more coordinated have some

00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:20,020
coordinate approach to build up the

00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:23,470
community out there as we found out that

00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:25,690
most of the cases the projects are not

00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:28,030
there that's why people are not being

00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:31,330
interested and the lack of projects

00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:32,980
coming out from the community the open

00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:37,690
Street local OpenStreetMap community is

00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:41,050
causing one of the bigger impact of lack

00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:44,410
of people being engaged with with the

00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:48,880
platform in a way we we are focusing on

00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:51,160
more on having the local building of

00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:55,780
local partnership with the government

00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:59,470
level also with local interpreters with

00:53:55,780 --> 00:54:04,270
with the startups whoever uses Maps we

00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:07,450
are trying to engage them into it and at

00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:11,130
the same time we are building up some

00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:13,359
innovative ideas like we have build a

00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:16,510
developer a group of people who are

00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:18,700
working with the innovation data driven

00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:20,920
innovation I would rather say that is

00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:23,530
based on OS M we are calling it one of

00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,540
the shopping Innovation Lab Boyle who

00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:27,460
are constantly working with in

00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:31,170
developing new ideas platforms and

00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:35,170
applications that can be integrated with

00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:38,650
Open Street Map data over there and at

00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:43,900
the same time we have a very very much

00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:46,540
highly expected projects we are

00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:48,850
continuing as a community over there to

00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:52,540
map up the Apple is the base layer of

00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:56,650
the map of countrywide and what happens

00:54:52,540 --> 00:55:00,220
it is in triggering the community people

00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:03,160
who are being trained earlier but not

00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:05,080
being engaged in the process right now

00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,900
there's all of a sudden they are saying

00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,859
that

00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:12,289
failures are being mapped over there

00:55:08,859 --> 00:55:18,619
around their neighborhood there now

00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:22,309
coming up I will I would say voluntarily

00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:24,880
coming up with and talking to us that

00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:27,380
they want to be a part of the project

00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,470
though they don't know that those

00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:33,319
projects are not being having any any

00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:36,470
sort of financial backing and other

00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:38,750
stuffs as their previous experience was

00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:41,029
there if there is something going on

00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:44,420
they have projects out there there might

00:55:41,029 --> 00:55:49,460
be some financing over there it is some

00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:52,130
sort of some sort of I would say

00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:54,470
triggering them up to engage more on it

00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:58,039
recently you might have seen a lot of

00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:59,930
things going on in OpenStreetMap in I

00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:04,130
will be talking about those things

00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:06,319
afterwards yeah I'm just gonna run over

00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:09,410
by like one minute by and allow him to

00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:12,849
make a comment in the back please our

00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:15,950
question you know I was going to ask or

00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:17,500
as for a reflection on a longer term

00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:20,920
maybe a bit of a longer term

00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:23,420
sustainability of the communities in

00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:28,339
Mozambique we we get a lot of campaigns

00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:30,740
from from the donors for civic actions

00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:34,240
above to train people in civic actions

00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:37,220
simple things like maybe waste

00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:40,910
separating waste or cleaning the front

00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:42,529
the front doors stuff like that and so

00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:44,720
when we started mapping we thought this

00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:47,569
would mapping should all also be part of

00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:50,420
the daily things you do as part of your

00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:53,240
society as your responsibility towards

00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:56,299
society you don't only clean the front

00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:58,099
yard you separate the waste the letter

00:56:56,299 --> 00:57:00,440
before throwing it in the trash can and

00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:02,539
you also map your home and your street

00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,960
and stuff like that so that was a bit of

00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:08,210
our vision when starting to map and

00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,790
the reality a year two years into the

00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:12,319
endeavor it's been it has been slower

00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:14,059
than we expected in the beginning we

00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:17,030
thought it would be out just let's just

00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:18,559
let's just show everybody OpenStreetMap

00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:20,750
and everybody will start putting their

00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,990
their homes on OpenStreetMap and stuff

00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:25,880
like that so is this is this something

00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:27,859
that the communities can strive towards

00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,930
like to train as much people as possible

00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:31,550
and eventually hope that they are

00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:33,950
sustainable just by the fact that

00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:36,380
everybody knows how to map we can we

00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:38,300
have various examples Facebook is very

00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:40,309
sustainable and nobody needs to be

00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:42,680
trained to be on Facebook it's it's

00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:45,349
automatic so maybe that would also be on

00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,450
the list of sustainability strategies

00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:49,640
maybe we should consider also like

00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:52,130
trying to train as much people and try

00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:54,920
to see if it can become a civic act

00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:57,829
something you do towards as part of your

00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,859
responsibility towards society I don't

00:57:57,829 --> 00:58:02,300
know if there is any reflection that oh

00:57:59,859 --> 00:58:03,559
yeah we kind of have to wrap up cuz I

00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,420
probably someone else is coming in the

00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:07,359
room but I think that's a great point

00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:10,940
also to kind of close with is you know

00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:12,319
getting making people think about okay

00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:14,420
well there's there's me there's my

00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,680
career there's also the we so somebody

00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:17,839
mentioned I think Chuck free about

00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,599
changing errors maybe one of you

00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:22,819
mentioned the I to the Wii idea and

00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:25,609
that's I think that's kind of what a lot

00:58:22,819 --> 00:58:27,799
of us in this conference have already

00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:31,069
achieved for ourselves is like we think

00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:33,710
about it as a week how can we kind of

00:58:31,069 --> 00:58:35,839
bring in thought thinking or at least

00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:37,730
you know start from start from that

00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:40,339
place when we introduce osm in different

00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:41,900
places or if we're if we have that

00:58:40,339 --> 00:58:45,200
ability to reach out to different

00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:46,910
communities there's so much more to talk

00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:50,030
about on this topic but unfortunately

00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:52,280
we're out of time I would love to

00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:53,750
continue talking so I don't know I'm

00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,579
probably going to try to create some

00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:58,280
kind of way that people can communicate

00:58:55,579 --> 00:59:01,760
beyond this particular panel so if you

00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:04,640
want to raise your hand or well don't

00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:08,010
raise it now but come up to me enjoying

00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:13,220
the discussion across all of

00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:13,220
