Description: 
	Rebecca Firth (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team), State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/T057-OSM_Community_Grants__sharing_experiences/

Since 2016, HOT has provided Microgrants and Device Grants to 25 OSM communities worldwide. This talk will be co-presented by community grants recipients, to share some of their inspirational achievements on extremely little funding, to spark interest in the global OSM community on what mini grants can achieve. This talk will also share the experiences and lessons learned from setting up grants programs with OSM communities, in order to equip others to be able to support community grants program going forward.

worth it thanks very much so I'm going

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,470
to talk a little bit about the community

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,250
grants programs that we've started at

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,580
hot in the last 18 months it's been

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,289
quite a different program I think to how

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,170
we envisaged and we've learned quite a

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,630
lot about how to do it that we sort of

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,670
wanted to share and we also wanted some

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,769
of the grant recipients to share a

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,099
little bit about how having a grant had

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,650
changed their community so Janet and

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,600
Remigio from quads map a Murphy under me

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,469
berry Oh are going to kind of share a

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,290
bit about their experiences as well but

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,379
just to introduce hot gives out grants

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,660
and so far in two ways firstly micro

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,550
grants which are unrestricted funding of

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,430
two to five thousand dollars and

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,860
secondly device grants which are

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,590
programs intended to kind of reduce

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,969
barriers to access to technology and

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:03,690
training to communities so we started

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,030
these programs with a few objectives and

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,250
they're written on the slide here so the

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,869
first one is help open mapping and open

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,479
data communities with the resources they

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,369
need to grow so how can we reduce the

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,400
most basic barriers that a community

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:21,270
will face the second one is to encourage

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,890
leadership skills and a better kind of

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,250
gender balance and youth participation

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,420
in in community projects a lot of the

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,430
time when we start working with the

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,829
community then there might be quite a

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,210
significant imbalance and it's something

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,509
that we would kind of like to help

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,130
address through the program thirdly to

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,740
help communities share their stories

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,450
with the global osm community and to

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,299
kind of learn from each other within

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,220
that network so there's obviously a lot

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,689
of people doing really great things but

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,240
sometimes those things are quite similar

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,000
and they're not necessarily connected so

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,979
trying to build that together as well

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,280
and then fourthly trying to broaden the

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,560
ways in which mapping is contributing to

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,030
humanitarian efforts and especially in

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,189
vulnerable places because that kind of

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,189
falls within hots mission more broadly

00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,000
so since 2017 and with the help of this

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,460
is a blatant shout out if you want to

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,160
talk out about Micah grants Amelia who

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,180
has done a lot of work to set them up

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,360
we've now delivered thirty-one grants in

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,550
23 countries so 31 kind of individual

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,740
communities and the grants ranged

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,630
between two thousand and eleven thousand

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,940
dollars so so far that's about a hundred

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,750
and eighty thousand in kind of

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,970
disbursements those have led to 8

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,010
million local edits to OpenStreetMap in

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,620
the communities they live and work so

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,080
big focus on the word local they're

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,430
obviously aspects of what hot and

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,320
missing maps do you involve remote

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,700
mapping and one of the big things we

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,440
really want to do with this program is

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,870
strengthen the local community that adds

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,400
kind of additional data in those places

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,470
so so far about 8 million edits and 9700

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,739
and ten new mappers who've been kind of

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,209
trained in those local areas as well so

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,040
typically they would be the recipient of

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,660
training from the leader of that

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,610
community or other kind of leaders

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,290
within the community but also sometimes

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,810
trying to kind of strengthen that with

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,580
hot trainers as well and sending them

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,530
out to those locations so now we're

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:30,090
going to hear from Janet at cross map

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,019
about her might cook on experience Thank

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:36,030
You Rebecca

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:38,880
so having a micro grant last year of

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,840
$5,000 was really transformational for

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,110
our project so prior to that we had had

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,230
virtually no funding although we had a

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,420
large cohort of remote mappers it's very

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,720
difficult to train people in the field

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,799
because we were entirely reliant on

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,989
people who happen to have their own

00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,900
device and we didn't really have any

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:04,799
money for training and so on so having a

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,160
micro grant last year allowed us to set

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,680
up community mapping groups in around 26

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,850
different locate locations across rural

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:19,080
Tanzania and terrain bring people to

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:21,139
training to allow them to start to use

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,199
ID editor on

00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:27,289
small number of laptops that we got but

00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,680
also to use map stop me on the phones

00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:33,199
that we also got through net hope and

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,469
also to do some more in-depth training

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,740
in things such as jaws and QGIS and so

00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:43,909
on one of the challenges that we had is

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,830
most of our field mappers are the local

00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:51,199
mappers are starting from a very low

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:53,659
base so prior to us getting devices they

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,029
were mostly men because they were the

00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:58,009
ones that had smartphones getting their

00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:01,159
grant allowed us to involve a lot more

00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:02,990
women but for most of them it was the

00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:06,379
first time that they'd used a smartphone

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:10,419
or a laptop many of them had was

00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:13,219
starting a very low educational base so

00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:16,240
having a micro grant has really

00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:24,379
transformed the way that we worked so

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:26,089
thank you for giving it to us okay I

00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:28,120
guess one of the things to mention on

00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:31,339
that note so the microphones are

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,469
entirely funded by the end of your

00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:35,029
fundraising campaign that we do and the

00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:37,250
target for that is normally about thirty

00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:39,050
thousand dollars and all of that is sent

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,080
straight to kind of community projects

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,870
like the one that Janet just described

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,569
and so yeah when we I guess advertise

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,490
that that campaign that's maybe a bit

00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:53,719
more kind of explanation on what then

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:56,810
actually happens happens with that now

00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:58,639
Remigio from maybe under my barrio we're

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:02,240
just going to show quickly a video that

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,629
that the community made about their

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,629
program

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:34,870
[Music]

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,760
it's a system system for the remain

00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,980
today

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,380
no incremental Community College gonna

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,570
see momentum of the problem of a minute

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,650
comment vous tuer allocation is meant

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,650
for feeding infants and

00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:00,820
[Music]

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:37,089
[Music]

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,849
don't you do the my dad when I read it I

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:48,150
mean this it is made from a some

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:51,900
processes indeed this is all she

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:55,340
possibly on stage was a severe Jewish

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,340
the doors after the hint

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,589
[Music]

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:22,510
[Music]

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:34,540
now Linda twist Muslims Confederacy

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,840
so the Putin international mafia doors

00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:40,240
in fact our little answers thought he

00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,760
our Prince permit Raj Kapoor north

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,770
control until the to determine the

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:49,690
relative gain handsome muchas gracias

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:52,090
approaches unity with a lot of our

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,260
production across long from some deep

00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,740
into the moon

00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:00,880
moontak recede he reported are are

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,280
continuing we are Celine travel to South

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,290
Audley in tundish communicates with

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,670
vendors Minaj for most readers who knows

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,670
who knows my name

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:22,279
[Music]

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,270
so Rebecca asked me to talk a little bit

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,700
about the challenges as well

00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:54,600
this video shows maybe the romantic part

00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:59,190
of what we have been doing in in muffle

00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,960
Allah and so she maybe asked me to talk

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,460
a little bit about also the challenges I

00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,210
think I presented some of them this

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:09,540
morning and rather than the repeating I

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,930
would like to say that for us as well as

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,880
as Janet said the change that happened

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,070
with the community from before the micro

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,850
grant then - after the micro grant was a

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:26,730
like a quite a radical change we came

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:30,960
from working with we came from working

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:33,810
with with a world bank in a pilot

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,910
project that was similar to $2 salams

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,670
Rahman urea so it was quite a big

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:42,060
project and after the funding of the

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,070
World Bank was I mean the project was

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,720
ended then it's kind of the whole

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,760
community kind of collapsed a little bit

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,290
and it's very nice to see that with

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,540
these small grants we have been doing

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,790
and we have been able to do maybe as

00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,110
much or I don't know more it's hard to

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,950
compare but we have been doing a lot of

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:02,550
mapping based on more volunteer more

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:05,040
peer-to-peer work rather than top-down

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:08,370
or like very a better hierarchical work

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,010
so it's a I think it has made a big

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,230
difference and it's interesting how

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,480
these small small budgets can can

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:19,770
produce such impacts while often like

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,780
the big budgets you have - I mean it's a

00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,150
discussion whether they're impactful in

00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,280
their in the same proportion so for us

00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,770
it was it was very nice to receive the

00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,900
grant last last year and today we are a

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:35,880
bit more autonomous I think we depend

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:38,040
less on foreign or like financing coming

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,290
from abroad we have contacts and we have

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,160
relationships inside of Mozambique with

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:48,150
local NGOs and with other interesting

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,300
part interested parties so I think it it

00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,220
all comes together really well the

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,980
branch was really a Kickstarter kind of

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,880
a Kickstarter for us so I think it's a

00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,880
success

00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,290
so kind of as well as the experience of

00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,570
the communities who receives the ground

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,970
we also wanted to highlight a little bit

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:13,310
of the challenges that we faced setting

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,170
up a program like this it kind of

00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,000
escalated perhaps a little bit more

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,950
rapidly than we thought I don't think

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,290
that we thought we'd be doing 31 grants

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,360
in 18 months when we first started this

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,710
out so it's definitely been some kind of

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,730
lessons learned along the way that we

00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:31,070
thought would be helpful to share the

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,810
first one of being that we had this kind

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,140
of preconception that we were going to

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:38,600
need to provide access to training or

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,460
knowledge about how to map and we had

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,200
kind of resourced and planned to say you

00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,020
know we've got all these resources and

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,300
these people you can speak to and that's

00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,650
what we're gonna be really helpful and

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,450
it turned out that we just we actually

00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:53,120
just didn't need that at all because osm

00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,820
already has all of that stuff like lino

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,980
seems amazing there's loads of local

00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,630
networks like that even just kind of osm

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,520
Africa what's up groups that people

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:05,360
found they were getting all the answers

00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:08,480
around what to map like or how to use a

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,000
tool from and actually there was quite a

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,670
lot of support that we had to do because

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,980
of the fact that we were working giving

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,170
grants to communities and a lot of the

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,150
time like I mean communities typically

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,470
can't actually receive funds from most

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,150
organisations because they need to be

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,360
legally registered and all sorts of

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:28,220
things so we came up with several

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,320
workarounds to kind of make sure that it

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,550
was safe to grant the money but we

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,840
didn't want to say you have to be a

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,520
community because that's the biggest

00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,350
sorry you have to be an organization

00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:40,160
because that's a huge barrier to

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,990
actually receiving any sort of funds but

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,640
that meant that typically we were

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,770
working with groups who hadn't ever

00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,300
received money before weren't

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,040
necessarily used to kind of the

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,320
financial processes or the reporting

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,670
that comes with that and so actually we

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,620
sort of you know thought we were going

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,420
to have to resource here on training and

00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,250
how to map and actually found we had to

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,910
kind of resource in an in a quite a

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,440
separate way and we also thought that

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,810
kind of people would be reasonably

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,060
comfortable with processes and actually

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,830
in those contexts

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,030
it was incredibly challenging to deliver

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,070
something that is essentially a

00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:17,380
volunteer program in short periods of

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:19,520
time so a local healthcare outbreak or

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,400
elections or something could kind of

00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,140
push a pusher program back by by months

00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,780
and months and we really learnt we had

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:29,390
to build that flexibility in and you

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,880
know it wasn't appropriate to expect

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,980
kind of a community project to to

00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,500
deliver perhaps in the way that an

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,600
organisation kind of larger more formal

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,460
project would and so we've learned a lot

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,420
about kind of flexibility in the process

00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,550
and making sure that it actually

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,590
benefits the community and it isn't just

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:50,420
like suiting our timelines because

00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:51,470
that's easier for us and yeah there were

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,300
some other barriers we didn't

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,850
necessarily anticipate that have been

00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,040
quite challenging like it's quite a

00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,660
significant administration effort which

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,160
if anyone is planning to do micro grants

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,010
we're more than happy to kind of advise

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,380
on how we navigated that and made it as

00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:09,110
light touch as possible but still being

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,850
accountable in the situation where we

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,310
essentially giving out community money

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,900
because their money comes from this

00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,270
crowdfunding campaign and then goes

00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,650
still to the community projects we're

00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,780
very aware that we want to make sure

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,430
that the community are kind of both very

00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,160
clear and what that's being spent on and

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,960
can see the impact of it which is also

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,460
quite challenging to do when you you

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:33,290
don't really have kind of a huge amount

00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:35,210
of resource on it and connectivity is

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,680
always a challenge but it's obviously

00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,200
even more of a challenge when you're

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,210
trying to work with so many locations at

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,370
once and so we really became very aware

00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,010
that actually you know having set

00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,320
meetings or high times for calls was

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,610
just not the best way to admit to kind

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,100
of collaborate because if you miss one

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,050
of them you're sort of out the loop and

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,310
so we came up with sort of a range of it

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,020
actually works a lot better if we just

00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,940
have a whatsapp group and things like

00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:03,080
that

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:04,780
oh my computers just gone to sleep and

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,970
then the final one is on sustainability

00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,950
so - what Remigio was was mentioning

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,050
about what we really wanted the micro

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:15,020
grants to be as well as those kind of

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,490
four goals that we gave we really wanted

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,199
Mike

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,499
it's a kind of springboard a community

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,779
to being more sustainable but there

00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:25,929
isn't really a huge amount of consensus

00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:27,519
on what sustainability is it means very

00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:29,529
different things to very different

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,860
people it's quite elusive and hard to

00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:34,379
method measure so kind of with the

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,540
approach that it's an art not a science

00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:39,759
we decided that there were kind of

00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,639
certain factors that seem to be

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,499
correlated with longevity and also

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,499
correlated with kind of increasing data

00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:49,869
quantity and quality and so looking at

00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:53,379
those factors how should we start to

00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:56,319
think about sustainability so we've

00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:59,199
developed a model which is a draft and

00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,569
is very very much open to feedback this

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,040
is all just based on the experience that

00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:04,899
we have and obviously other people's

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,740
experience and as our experience grows

00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:10,600
we'd love to change it but we felt like

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,149
there'd seem to be these kind of four

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,630
categories which impacted sustainability

00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:18,939
quite significantly which were resources

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,039
and technical skills which of you'll see

00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,380
on the bottom side are kind of mostly

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,059
easier to fund so when we when we give

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,500
out a micro grant this is mostly the

00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,569
stuff that we're kind of funding on the

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,669
left-hand side but then there is all

00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:32,909
these kind of contextual things which

00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:35,169
are really important for community like

00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:37,169
organization and governance structure

00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:40,510
and the networks that they're part of

00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:42,250
which are harder to fund but also kind

00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,220
of lead tend to lead to much more

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,169
exciting opportunities so what we've

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,450
developed is essentially a model where

00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:51,760
when can kind of we start a micro grant

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,909
now people can kind of self assess

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,919
against this set identify ones that

00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:58,870
they're interested to focus on and

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,429
improve and then throughout their micro

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,350
go on and then at the end they can then

00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:04,779
kind of redo that assessment and see if

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:07,179
they think maybe they met met some of

00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:08,770
those goals obviously we're very aware

00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:11,230
this is all prep you know these is only

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,549
as good as the model is etc and so we

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,020
are really trying to improve it with the

00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,029
experience that we have on we're just

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,789
testing out but it's something that we'd

00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:21,010
love to kind of make widely available to

00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:23,500
anybody who was interested in improving

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,149
sustainability even just kind of in an

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,919
open-source community not necessarily a

00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:27,710
mapping community because there's

00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,580
there's quite a lot of

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:34,070
overlap and the Asterix

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,110
things just as an FYI would really like

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,440
the basic things that we thought this is

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:42,620
like the minimum that you need which is

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,960
enough people devices to use access the

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,970
internet and everything else you don't

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,950
need all of these things want some

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,710
people have kind of one set some people

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,870
have another set but as a general blend

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,460
this is what seems to work from the

00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:59,630
communities that we've we've been

00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:01,100
working with so I think we now have a

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,049
few minutes for questions

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,940
perfect I don't know if you guys want to

00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,940
stand up to okay

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:16,600
no because that was something that we

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,600
thought was easier to learn

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:28,730
yeah I guess you need like one person

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:34,730
you know come up to point so any

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:36,980
questions gonna write thanks for there

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,170
that was very enlightening and inspiring

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,100
also I'm with the OpenStreetMap

00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,980
Foundation Board as is Heather and we're

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:48,530
looking at doing things like this also

00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:51,080
you were talking about accountability

00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:55,700
and keeping it also lightweight at the

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,260
same time so how how do you work how

00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,970
does that work at a more practical level

00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,780
like how do you how how are people

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,900
accountable

00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:05,120
what kind of reporting is in place how

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,180
do you do that yeah

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,240
yeah good question and challenging to

00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,980
achieve what we have done is essentially

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,740
the grants are 12 months and there's a

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,660
midterm in and end-of-term report and

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,550
when people kind of put in their

00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,780
application for a grant they say that

00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,000
you know this is what I want to achieve

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,740
and then essentially they kind of report

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,170
on how they are against that but with

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,520
the caveat that actually you could sort

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,750
of not achieve some of the things you

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,280
put on your report but achieve a bunch

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,890
of other things and that might still be

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,330
be great and then from a financial

00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,150
process just kind of submitting all

00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:41,300
their receipts and kind of how far they

00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:44,120
are kind of in their spend because for

00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,610
example if halfway through the micro

00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,650
grant process someone spent 1% of their

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,910
budget you might want to kind of replan

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:53,570
when you send them the second half of

00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:55,280
their of their money and so we've tried

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,740
to do it like two points in the year

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,840
just to minimize effort and but what we

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,430
found last year was that you know three

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,620
of the communities had like natural

00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,630
disasters hurricane like health

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,950
outbreaks etc and we had to kind of

00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,950
extend that a little bit for them

00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:20,050
did some of the grants have mentors this

00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:23,110
is a really good question

00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:24,490
so mentorship was something that

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,500
actually on reflection probably should

00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,940
have gone on the assumptions thing we

00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,210
were like oh well we'll give everyone a

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,100
mentor and that will just work and it

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,830
totally didn't work

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,270
people ended up having kind of reduced

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,150
availability perhaps from their original

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,380
mentor but getting loads of help from

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,200
people who weren't their kind of

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:47,530
official mentor or channels and so I

00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,050
think there was sort of some guidance

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:52,450
available but it wasn't as simple as

00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,970
just saying mentor grantee off you go

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,070
and one thing we'd built in this year is

00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,720
trying to do more peer-to-peer

00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,100
mentorship because actually Janet and

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,020
Romita were the two people that gave

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,760
this feedback that they actually learned

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,250
more from each other than they did from

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,710
their mentors and we hadn't really built

00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,660
in a framework for them to to speak so

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,130
that was what we are trying to take

00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,400
advantage of and kind of improved them

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,400
forward

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:30,820
how much work is it and full-time

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:35,920
equivalents to manage your program like

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:37,750
that give or take so manage it the way

00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,120
that we do it's probably about a

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,920
half-time resource which is merely our

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,840
standing in the corner so if you have

00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,610
detailed questions on process she will

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,100
answer all of them for you

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,900
but I'd say around about that and I

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,450
think if you're doing less than that

00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,900
then honestly you're it's hard not to

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:57,100
compromise on things like are we sure we

00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,440
know what this money was actually spent

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,580
on and so it probably would be possible

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,380
to do it with less a lot of

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,710
organizations give away grants and don't

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:09,660
do that much follow up but to do follow

00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,660
up I'd say half a half a person

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:22,150
allocation so were there more applicants

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:28,660
than grants given out and how do you

00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:30,820
select from so every year we have a

00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,800
theme for the grants so last year was

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,750
pretty broad we went first sustainable

00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,270
development goals and this year was

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,800
projects relating to disaster so

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,240
obviously you know if you pick quite a

00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,520
niche theme you probably end up with

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,120
less applicants but we had about 80

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,220
applicants for eight grants and the

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,200
selection we built a panel where we had

00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,920
just kind of representation of the

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,620
organization so we had executive

00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:00,040
director Tyler one senior staff member

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,020
one voting member one person from a

00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,500
donating organization because we get

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,510
matched funding for that that program

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,700
and I think we'd like to in the future

00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,130
building also like a previant previous

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:19,030
grant recipient but we didn't really

00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:20,410
have that luxury first time around are

00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:24,910
they kissing

00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:26,550
I think it's really interesting that you

00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,650
say that you have a specific focus

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:32,440
because if you have that focus that it

00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:35,110
it also encourages support within the

00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:39,130
grantees so I think that's a really neat

00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:42,060
idea but my main question was in your

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:48,940
first slide where you had the four

00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:53,610
different target areas you say youth

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:56,700
participation why not older generation I

00:24:53,610 --> 00:25:01,330
often feel that the older generation is

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:03,130
forgotten you know all the statistics on

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,280
diversity that we've been seeing today

00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:10,120
shows that you know the average age is

00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:13,570
sort of between 30 and 40 and often

00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:19,080
older people have actually got more time

00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:22,480
and can actually do more and they may

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,880
you know their age gives them certain

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,760
knowledge that maybe the youth doesn't

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,070
so I'm just questioning why youth

00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:35,680
participation is seen as being so

00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:37,680
important yeah I guess there's kind of

00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,210
both a long and a short answer to that

00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,260
one thing being that there are kind of a

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,520
lot of great youth initiatives within

00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:48,630
OpenStreetMap and we kind of wanted to

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,980
support the growth of some of those with

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:53,860
the micro grants program so we were

00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,180
interested to kind of promote that the

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,520
other being I guess slightly more

00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,080
theoretical and around kind of theories

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,900
of change and social change in a

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,400
community and a lot of the actual

00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,010
communities that are beneficiaries of

00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,010
these grants are places where people

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:11,170
face kind of extreme gender equality

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:13,270
issues and things like that

00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,890
and there's a lot of research that says

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,720
you know if you kind of capture people

00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,060
at a time of change in their life

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,820
anyway you have a much kind of higher

00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,080
chance of changing perhaps the way that

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,360
they think about certain issues all the

00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,220
way that they contribute to issues so we

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,450
were quite kind of passionate about kind

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,430
of capturing people at a moment of

00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,549
change I kind of go into university or

00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,100
leaving University

00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:36,080
and with that moment also kind of

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,940
introducing other things that we'd love

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,379
them to be involved in for kind of the

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,840
rest of their lives

00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:43,419
encouraging kind of older generations to

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,789
participate I think would be fantastic

00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:49,580
but it would be a huge challenge in

00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:51,860
terms of it like ability to use

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,450
equipment kind of in current current

00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,340
state and that kind of thing and

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,320
secondly no one applied for no one had

00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,570
any project applications what we're

00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,860
working with older generations so you

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,749
know we weren't kind of choosing what

00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,039
the micro grants are about we receive

00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:05,840
applications and accept some

00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,299
applications and none of them were

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,279
focused on working with older

00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:14,649
communities so if some wants to do that

00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:14,649
next year then you can be different

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:22,999
it'll be fast we I've only a few minutes

00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:25,700
I'll be really faster just a small

00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:29,419
question did you actually rate the

00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:32,090
project in any form success fail or

00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:34,009
finer than that and how was the outcome

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,940
I assume not all of them actually

00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:40,279
achieved their goals

00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:42,259
yeah I'd say every every community

00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:44,029
achieved something wasn't necessarily

00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:47,480
what they planned to achieve at the

00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:50,570
start definitely we did kind of rate

00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,029
there their reports as they came in to

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,649
decide if they in the midterm report if

00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:56,720
they get their second tranche of funding

00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:58,700
or not and in the end of the report to

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,889
say would we fund this person again

00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,230
one thing we're really interested to do

00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:05,149
is actually to kind of say that you know

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,830
all of us here know that sustainability

00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:09,109
isn't like a magic word that you can

00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:11,869
paint a brushstroke and achieve in a

00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:13,100
year and we'd quite like to get to the

00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:16,519
stage where for example like the best

00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,659
final report like the community that

00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:19,759
achieves the most in their final report

00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:21,109
gets the grant again the next year and

00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:24,139
more something like that so kind of

00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:27,619
again like bring enthusiasm and kind of

00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:28,850
continuity to more of the programs but

00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:30,889
yeah I would say there wasn't any

00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:33,980
community that kind of didn't achieve

00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:36,019
anything but there was sometimes a

00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,779
disconnect between what they planned at

00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:40,820
the start and what for various and kind

00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:43,570
of myriad reasons they ended up working

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,570
on something a bit different

00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,570
okay we can move on the next door

00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,479
