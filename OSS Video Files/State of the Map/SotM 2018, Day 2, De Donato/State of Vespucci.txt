I'm Simon and the slides are hopefully

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:09,540
going to work right now last time I did

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,420
a talk on Vespucci was five years ago in

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,040
Birmingham at Sultan so I'm not going to

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:19,830
go through the change list I'd have to

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:23,609
talk even faster than Brian so I'm just

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:28,560
concentrating or we did this year we had

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:31,920
released ten just as Brian I try to have

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,790
a minor release with small updates once

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,739
per month and we're doing about two

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:43,770
major releases per year and perhaps

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:48,829
minor larger releases two to three per

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:51,930
you best thing that we did I think was

00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:54,500
WMS support and MB tire support an open

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,309
area map I had a discussion yesterday

00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,699
about Vespucci and people said well why

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,979
do you actually have background imagery

00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:07,409
well the thing is if you see the aerial

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,600
imagery and you're there you can put a

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,729
lot more into context and you can

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,070
actually see for example this artwork

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,920
outside you can actually see okay this

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:21,860
is this white thing which is on the

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:27,240
imagery we just released version 11

00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:29,759
early this month has a Geo chosen layer

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:35,009
support so you can actually load an open

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:39,119
data set and see where things are

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:42,689
directly I use that for address mapping

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,460
for example we have an outer preset

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,570
function now so you can actually search

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:52,020
for a term and it will generate a preset

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,090
for you that is stored in permanent

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,659
storage on your device you can actually

00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:03,409
reuse it or improve it and a couple of

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:05,759
other things stuff that you should try i

00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:07,920
these are stuff things that have been

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,709
around for quite a long time indoor mode

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,569
preset based filters and precip based

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,739
filters are

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:15,409
interesting because there was this

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:18,680
Twitter thing going on just before I

00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:21,620
came here that all the pedestrian

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:27,950
crossings in Milano don't actually have

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:32,900
curbs tax and you can make Vespucci into

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:37,150
a dedicated pedestrian crossing app with

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,150
preset filters in about 10 seconds

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,209
upcoming even better police at handling

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,489
perhaps not map roulette support that

00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,359
depends very much on my time she still

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:51,590
here nope

00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:53,919
and the tenth anniversary this butchers

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:59,329
been around a very very very long time

00:02:53,919 --> 00:03:02,180
for an Android app ten years March 2019

00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:06,230
and as you can see the development has

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:09,919
been going on quite consistently over

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,949
that time so really the only thing that

00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,530
I actually wanted to say is due to

00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:19,009
Google will be dropping support for pre

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:22,400
Android for devices but perhaps even

00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:26,870
four point four sorry for that not our

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,139
fault if you really want us to continue

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,669
support you should talk to us we had a

00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,769
similar problem we have a similar

00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:37,400
problem with two point three Android

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:39,639
every time I ask nobody complains but we

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,639
actually had a regression in our code

00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:45,859
early this year and I saw lots of

00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,430
crashes on two point three devices so

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:51,919
there I actually being used out there

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:55,900
nobody communicates with us so thank you

00:03:51,919 --> 00:04:01,789
you want to look up stuff that's it

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,789
