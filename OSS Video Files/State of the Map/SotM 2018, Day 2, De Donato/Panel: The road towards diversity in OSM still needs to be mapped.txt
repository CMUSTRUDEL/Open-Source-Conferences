	Celine Jacquin (Geochicas), State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/W005-The_road_towards_diversity_in_OSM_still_needs_to_be_mapped/

Geochicas will follow up to last year’s discussion in Japan about the need to create more initiatives that encourage participation of women in OSM, their active role in decision making spaces and more projects and activities led by women. We’ll present the results from the International Gender Representation Survey, that seeks to understand gender balance, hostile situations and the need or not of CoC in OSM. We found that many contributors perceive the lack of gender equality but do not see the necessity to shift the numbers nor increase the debate because they don’t believe in mapping as a sociopolitical practice and instead believe in maps as neutral and have nothing to do with a contributors' gender condition. As Hanna and Del Casino argue, maps are ‘mediated by the multiplicity of knowledges we bring to and take from them through our everyday interactions and discursive practices’ We believe there is a crucial opportunity to understand and make visible the minorities needs in OSM

00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:09,660

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:14,250
with a short presentation of the chicas

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,139
group what we do why do we exist and I

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,880
will present the result of an

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,710
international survey we made to

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,150
understand better as a participation of

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:27,210
women in OpenStreetMap community in in

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:31,529
other countries and they level of

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,390
leadership and after that I only take 20

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,340
minutes and after that we will invite

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,219
you to participate in a brainstorming

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:43,920
activity to help us to have ideas and

00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:47,670
commitments to work diversity in

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,210
OpenStreetMap community so yo chicas is

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,539
a group of women from OpenStreetMap

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:58,230
Latin America community it's a young

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:02,340
group we exist for one year and a half

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:07,920
only I'm Celine Chaka map adora in

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:12,689
OpenStreetMap so why why this group

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,060
exists we we were part we are part of

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,299
Latin American community which is a

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,590
community very active in in a church in

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:27,900
telegram chat with the participation of

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:30,720
more or less 100 115 people from every

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,020
country of Latin America and some days

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,040
in the occasion of the organization of

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,579
state of the map Latin in Sao Paulo we

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,920
realized we were only five women in this

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,590
group expressing ideas expressing

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,439
opinion and participating in in the

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,250
organization of activities and we

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,299
realized it's me it might be a problem

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,790
it might be an expression of the

00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:04,229
unbalance of generous participation in

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,780
in the community so in this moment we

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,869
decided to organize in this same state

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,239
of the map in Sao Paulo

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,730
Pinella first panel and the group and

00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,299
network of women of women attending this

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:21,080
advance to start to think it was we just

00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:23,870
wanted to think and we also thought

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:28,670
about these statements you you all know

00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:31,849
we don't have really reliable statistic

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,590
on genders on in OpenStreetMap but we

00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,329
all know this number it's an estimation

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,019
that's only three percent of

00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:41,540
OpenStreetMap members are women so we

00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:44,480
try to think to how to improve this

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,530
participation and grow women

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,890
participation in the community we also

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:56,299
started to think that at the creation at

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:59,030
the data creation level it's it can be a

00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:05,870
real problem to have only the vision of

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:11,989
one gender and one profile of of people

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:15,250
who are white men and North American

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:19,190
European what white men making the data

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:23,180
deciding which has agenda of

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:27,230
OpenStreetMap which are interest point

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:31,280
of interest so this is the state of the

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:35,900
map in Sao Paulo in this panel we

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:40,069
invited people from attendees to to sit

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:43,819
with us in the table and to talk it was

00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:48,349
successful we all talk about the our

00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:51,410
perception of the problem a part of that

00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:53,419
and is considered that there is no

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,790
problem with a balance of gender in the

00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:58,519
community there is no problem with the

00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:01,400
data but it's we had a good debate and

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:06,769
at the end of this day we were a group

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:09,650
of women with 25 maybe 25 women we start

00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:13,280
to chat and we start to dialogue and we

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,900
are now one year and a half after 150

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,980
women in these chats with maybe

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,500
[Music]

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:24,410
3250 women active expressing sharing

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,250
information and promoting the

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,440
participation in in events and

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,710
OpenStreetMap and on any any topic on

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,790
open technologies and open data in Latin

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,710
America this is a map now of the country

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,870
represented so we have a large

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:45,530
participation in Latin America and also

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:50,600
in Spain and other countries of of

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:54,200
Europe so the language is Spanish but we

00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,940
also integrates English if if needed we

00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,350
have also women from India so our

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,180
objectives in the group is to empower

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,669
women in the community in order to have

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,820
more projects led by women this is a

00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:10,100
point point one and projects focused on

00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,400
women issues in society and daily life

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:17,090
it's a point to we want to enlarge the

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,330
OpenStreetMap Women's Network so we we

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,460
have a permanent effort in social

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,100
network to share ideas and to invite

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,220
women to participate and or just to be

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,990
observe a tour in the group and

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:33,680
benefiting from the information from the

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,479
reflection we have they're having more

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,810
participation of women in OpenStreetMap

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:42,530
and technology's activity so we try to

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:45,470
have two each in each global state of

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,380
the map a participation of 100 chicas

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,419
and in regional state of the map we also

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:54,080
try to have the participation of one or

00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:55,880
several chicas we also create small

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,680
spaces in which we can discuss the raw

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,030
representation and participation of

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,580
women so we try to have presence in the

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,740
in the events but we also try to have

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,500
the type of activities we will have

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,389
after my presentation so a reflection

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,229
panel

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:16,689
brain stomach activity to make you

00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:20,229
community think about about it's not

00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:22,030
only between women we also discuss

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:26,409
better better codes of conduct in the

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:31,150
community and this this year and a half

00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:35,620
we have led four main projects so I will

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:38,949
present them very quickly so most

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,349
important for us is a national gender

00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,840
representation survey in OpenStreetMap I

00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:47,050
represented that at the end the streets

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,979
of women it's a mapping project where we

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:56,009
we check the balance of names of women

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:58,979
and men in the cities and we we have

00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:02,949
participated these last months in

00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:05,139
projects granted by hot two maps

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:08,229
earthquake recovery and gender violence

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:11,400
in the context of crisis in Oaxaca

00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:15,340
Mexico after the earthquake of October

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,770
2017 and we have a permanent effort of

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:21,039
training peer-to-peer training in the in

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:25,240
our chat online and peer-to-peer and

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:28,960
with allies companies a box cutter and

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,300
other so this is the streets of women

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,580
this is a map of cities who has

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,620
participated in in the development of

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,409
the streets and the application of this

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:44,129
script to their cities this is an

00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:47,580
example and Mexico City so these

00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:54,490
discrete only filter and represents the

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:57,279
streets in yellow in yellow you can see

00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,029
the streets with a name of women so and

00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:03,789
this is in general you have a very large

00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:05,979
gap between main streets and women

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,979
streets in grains and main streets and

00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:11,979
we make the link when we have an article

00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:15,099
in Wikipedia we makes a link between the

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:16,330
name and the article so we also make a

00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:19,880
balance of

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:24,440
the names that don't have all that have

00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:27,650
an article in Wikipedia the second

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:31,490
project is a mapping in the crisis

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:34,930
context in Oaxaca so with the micro

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:38,210
grant of hot we covered with

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:42,320
street-level images since it's glued to

00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:46,150
mapillary and open street cam almost 15

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,880
towns in this zone the objective is to

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:53,990
visualize and some measures and recovery

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,900
of destruction the design was very

00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,350
affected by the earthquake and the state

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:03,470
hasn't done a lot so it's our job

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:06,110
objective to visualize that and with

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:11,230
more qualitative work and research we

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:15,100
try to investigate the presence of

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:18,230
violence gender events in the community

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:23,540
we are not able now to share definitive

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:28,060
results but in some months I hope and we

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:32,810
have saw a permanent a photo of training

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:34,030
so we had a course basic and advancing

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:39,200
with with Kato

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:41,840
also causes our sales in YouTube so in

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,330
the moment we give the training we want

00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,460
we want it to be interactive for women

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:50,480
but at the end it's totally available

00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:53,060
for anyone and we are about to organize

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,360
a basic and advanced and course with my

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,550
box and in within the community we had

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,240
course on github

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:04,250
QGIS some technical level is very

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,400
variable in the community so we had

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:11,320
trainings on very basic tools and very

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:15,740
advancing tools also in coding and

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:19,000
that's it so now I present some of the

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,000
results of our survey

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:31,410
we have participation of 250 people from

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,170
all the world which translated the

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:37,880
survey in five languages which was a

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:40,950
little complex to to presence at the end

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,890
this is a map of these countries the

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:48,030
main participants came from United

00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:51,770
States Brazil Spain and Germany and

00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:58,800
United Kingdom and these other countries

00:10:51,770 --> 00:11:03,090
we had the participation of the 57% of

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:06,960
men 40% of women one trans and

00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:11,820
transgender person and other people who

00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:16,230
didn't want to communicate that I read

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:18,180
the question have you ever felt

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,580
difficulty expressing your point of view

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,590
or failed at your knowledge area of

00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,960
interests were of little relevance

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,720
compared to the manner in your community

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,930
so the main part of the more women

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,270
consider that yes but a good part

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:37,680
consider that not a good part that

00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:44,910
sometimes the transgender person also

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:48,990
considered that it was difficult this is

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:50,640
a answer by men so if you ever

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,950
experienced a difficulty expressing

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,530
points of view knowledge or a real

00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:58,200
interest to certain members of your

00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:02,700
community so mature is a majority

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:05,850
consider that no if you have a fat

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:09,240
hostility from Filomena's osm community

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,110
so men consider that no women consider

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:16,980
at some time

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:19,680
oh yes and what did you feel free to

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:24,060
communicate what happened when they are

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,990
felt austerity so men no because I don't

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:30,140
feel hostility and women consider that

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:35,420
yes they they feel free to communicate

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:38,090
and sometimes just sometimes have you

00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:41,090
ever felt hostility from fellow men made

00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,830
towards women or towards a gender and a

00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:49,820
represented group in the OpenStreetMap

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:53,210
community men considers that no that

00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:56,480
means they don't feel hostility toward

00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:59,510
themselves but they don't see hostility

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:05,630
toward the the other people - that's

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:07,730
interesting to understand do you think

00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,340
it's necessary to have certain codes and

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,030
policies of conduct that favor the

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,980
majority and both different gender

00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:21,050
consider that yes it would be good

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:23,330
actually men most to consider that it

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,070
would be good do you think OpenStreetMap

00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:28,310
community has a balanced gender

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:32,330
representation the majority agree to

00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:35,360
consider that no and do you think that

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:39,620
affects how the data is generated and

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,350
activities are conducted and so majority

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,600
consider that yes but there is not a big

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:49,730
difference between with the person that

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:52,550
consider that no do you think the vision

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:55,940
of all everybody is represented by the

00:13:52,550 --> 00:14:01,180
geographical elements on the map so we

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:05,270
have the same proportion of answered

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:10,100
considering the previous question they

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:14,600
consider that no and these questions are

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,820
about participation and leadership so in

00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,070
the communities in the local communities

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,330
national communities international

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:27,200
communities and of open code and open

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:29,090
data communities how is suppose a women

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,949
participation versus the main

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:34,800
participation

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:36,750
in general in in each scale of community

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,550
people consider that the participation

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:45,029
of women is very low but we can see that

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:47,639
in local community the participation of

00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:50,639
women is considered a little more

00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,610
important than in other communities

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,870
national and international communities

00:14:52,610 --> 00:15:00,930
we see the same thing in the leadership

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:05,579
representation of women in general it is

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:08,160
considered that as low and in each

00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:12,389
community but in the local community it

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:18,959
tends to be a little more important so

00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:22,680
that was a short interpretation of the

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:25,560
quantitative data of the survey this

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:30,050
data is available she wants to know it's

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,050
better and we also had other

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:41,310
consideration so in qualitative

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,269
questions

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:49,470
I met a short sighted synthesis of

00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:51,959
opinion women tend to comment that the

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,449
sexy stone in the channels that

00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:58,310
motivates their participation talking

00:15:54,449 --> 00:16:01,050
about mailing lists chats and forum

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,180
women feel a systematic target of

00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,470
discrimination in the channel when they

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:13,259
express opinions divergent opinion and

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:16,139
they so people who who make attention

00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:19,529
calls are usually attacked they are

00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:22,319
women and not if they are men the

00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:24,720
expression of experience is low accepted

00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:29,009
women are considered in general as novel

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,290
notice by default and they propose they

00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:34,699
consider we need to define code

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,680
sanctions and reporting mechanisms and

00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:39,350
their purpose too

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,569
have specific calls to 40 for

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:45,529
participation in activities to empower

00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:49,540
women and promote women networks and

00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:53,959
private spaces to to have more

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:56,209
empowerment to enhance peer-to-peer

00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,519
trainings and to have attention to

00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:03,880
mapping projects issues that we've

00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:06,230
impact on women quality of life so men

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,689
comments that they consider a

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:12,140
discrimination is not based on gender

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:14,270
usually and that's it's very clear we

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,520
have a cultural domination of European

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,970
and North American men and that's some

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,010
more discrimination discrimination bases

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:25,730
they feel austerity by a specific

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:28,940
profile towards each gender and each

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:32,750
people that is the phonetic mapper very

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,610
experimented versus novice so I feel

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,870
that this is the point of the violence

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,440
and the aggressivity in the

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:43,399
OpenStreetMap channels they consider in

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,980
general that if we don't have a formal

00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:48,460
impediment to participate there is no

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:53,299
discrimination and there is no

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:55,940
unbalanced data mines but by the

00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:58,580
community and that's a lack of interest

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,580
or the lack of participation from women

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:06,010
but must be respected because it's just

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:08,899
a desire and they consider also that

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:12,320
they have doubts on the impacts on in

00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:16,669
the map of this imbalance and lack of

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,919
diversity their propositions are that we

00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:20,899
would have we could have attention calls

00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,270
about aggressive turns in the channel

00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:26,570
and in general they are ignored

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:31,669
so women women are attacked when they

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:33,919
call attention men are ignored and they

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:36,590
wouldn't separate gender but do more

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,960
participatory activities to invite more

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,480
people in general to participate and as

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,390
an effect have more women participation

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:48,320
but any any other gender and any

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:52,210
of a community and they consider that

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:56,770
working on women is like victim

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:59,810
victimizing women and they prefer to

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:02,090
raise awareness in general and focus

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:07,580
activity on diversity in general not

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:09,860
just on gender and both gender consider

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,560
that austerity is generally in

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:15,230
OpenStreetMap chanel is generally came

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,260
from come from high-level mappers and

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,260
it's demotivates

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:23,180
participation everybody agree with that

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,310
all generalities specific hostility

00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:31,610
toward people asking to change the tone

00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:35,470
and varies so consideration is that we

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:38,660
urgently need moderation in channels and

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:42,260
we need to advocate for courtesy values

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:45,080
more than conduct codes and awareness

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:48,560
about integration and support to devices

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,830
and need for integration of diversity in

00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,230
general not based in gender having an

00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,810
inclusive language and defend an

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:59,330
inclusive language define codes

00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:02,600
sometimes defined codes of conduct and

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:06,980
having a wellness against hierarchies

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:12,200
between advancing mappers and novice and

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:14,870
between different cultures that's it so

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,120
I invite you now to participate in a

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:21,740
brainstorming we will do we will put

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:24,020
their material to think together

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:35,510
Heather will help me to explain the

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:38,900
activity so please don't leave if you

00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:42,550
have a question maybe I can give ten

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:46,070
minutes while we install the material

00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:49,009
first just a real round of applause for

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:54,029
geo chicas I mean

00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:57,210
it's really it's really important and so

00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:59,460
thank you thank you so questions you

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:04,159
said questions before we start

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,159
questions comments and hi Rory

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:16,110
and hi yeah again thanks you're doing

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,399
great stuff and you kind of covered some

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,740
of this but I think it's important to

00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:21,960
remember and we should be inclusive of

00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,419
non-binary genders as well so it's not

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,610
just not just to there's people who who

00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,750
aren't men and women so I think it's

00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,179
nice to that I mean you do cover some of

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,090
that and you had in your survey I can't

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,830
remember how it was actually written but

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,740
you presented it as men women and

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:40,769
transgender which is not a gender right

00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,919
that's yeah not how but I think that was

00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:46,889
in the results so just yeah that's not

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,960
great and another advice I'd have with

00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,759
them if you're doing a thing for women

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,100
it might be handy sometimes to say like

00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:54,840
trans women or women just to to remind

00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:00,600
people that that's how you stand on that

00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:02,789
and so that's good and I suppose I agree

00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,740
that Kodokan dogs are great and I you

00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:06,509
know I'm not a list that has one and and

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,330
I think it's important to remember to

00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:13,259
know how they work and what they mean

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:16,549
and so it is societal education is good

00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:19,649
otherwise it's just a bit of paper and

00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,179
okay I'm going to go there for example

00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:22,649
the hot sandwich is taking place in a

00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,049
place where it's illegal to be gay and

00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:28,259
they thought it was a safe space and

00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:30,870
claimed it would be a safe place for for

00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:32,519
LGBTQ people which in my opinion means

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,230
they don't know what that means so I

00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,330
think just having a code of conduct is

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,350
often not enough we sort of need

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,419
everyone needs to know what it means

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,460
it's like education and the community

00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,419
about what we want to do and I know that

00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,289
so I think it's important to keep that

00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:49,309
in mind that's all

00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:51,929
thank you yeah we had these these

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:54,300
debates in the group at the start of the

00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:57,630
developing of the survey

00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:01,860
the survey in the beginning was false to

00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:04,440
Latin America and we decided to start to

00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:08,340
start the dialogue with men and women

00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,890
because the reflection is so low

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,679
developed they at this moment that it

00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:19,820
was a first step but I agree it's a

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,820
weakness there are others question I

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,280
think we may improve it because it's a

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,679
little short

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:37,770
it's a little simple I was a little

00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:40,320
disappointed about the answers the

00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:43,290
number of answers because we which

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,980
translated in five languages and we we

00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:52,020
only had accepts in English in Spanish

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:55,770
we had less than 20 answers so I think

00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:58,260
it's a it's a big question to develop a

00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:02,370
survey and to think about diffusion of

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:04,620
it and maybe we could ask for help or

00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:08,240
the foundation it's a good idea

00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,240
yeah it would be good

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:24,370
so when we talk about diversity is

00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:30,100
genital cement or is it better suited

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:32,410
mobile sense sorry can you repeat if we

00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:39,669
talk about diversity is on the agenda

00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:45,309
diversity meant the survey yes is about

00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:50,140
gender diversity Alegria of a diversity

00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:52,720
question but it's about in there maybe

00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:56,049
we can if you have our question I can

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,440
chat with you after we can start the

00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:01,990
brainstorming session again thanks to

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,720
Selena and to the geo chicas so she

00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:07,570
asked us to well we decided that we

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,210
would try and collaborate a bit over the

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,039
last days we've had a number of

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,500
conversations about community in number

00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:16,690
of different sessions and I think

00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,870
there's some really bright ideas about

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,159
how we might grow OpenStreetMap not just

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,659
in terms of gender diversity but in

00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,690
terms of other kinds of diversity

00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:28,799
whether it be global global community or

00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:31,690
language and so there's an exercise that

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,340
we've done before in other communities

00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,740
and I thought might be helpful if for us

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,720
to have that more productive and let me

00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,510
tell you what will happen with it I'll

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,669
tell you what the exercise Rory not Rory

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:45,100
part of me just is not here right now

00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:47,890
but he's gonna hold a birds of a feather

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,270
tomorrow so the discussion is again

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,580
we're gonna come up with some brainstorm

00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:53,350
ideas and then the discussion tomorrow

00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,120
will be more about what do we do with

00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,610
that and so just know that there's a few

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,340
of us kind of co-working to try and kind

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,350
of keep the vibe in the conversation so

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,110
there are sticky notes by different

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,520
colors okay and so what will happen with

00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,990
this data that we're gonna collect from

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,720
you we're gonna document it and give it

00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:13,360
back to you that's one two so there's a

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,880
sticky note that says I will which is a

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,669
statement around what will you do in

00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,100
this community it could be small it

00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:22,840
could be like you know what I'm gonna

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,690
monitor my own tone and be positive

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,490
that's the Heather ISM okay or I will

00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,350
talk to my local chapter

00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:32,380
and ask them how they feel or what they

00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:34,809
think is important another one example

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,690
so that's one color city note the next

00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:40,990
one big skate for demoing the next one

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:44,080
is we should stop okay

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:45,760
so there's some things that we think we

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,520
should work on right so what should we

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,029
stop as a collective community the last

00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:54,429
one is we should continue or we should

00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:56,470
start right so these are kind of three

00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:59,350
actions and so we're going to use these

00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:02,049
boards because thank you for hacking the

00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,610
system here so statements it's more

00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:05,640
statements so you can make a sentence

00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:08,799
with a verb and a noun if you so choose

00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,360
if you put it in another language we can

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,740
use Google Translate to translate that

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,260
if we don't know the language but feel

00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,090
free because we are from different folks

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,770
in different places and I'm sorry I only

00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:22,570
speak English and some really poor

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:29,610
French so the the actions are pink for I

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:32,230
will do blue for we should stop and

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:34,510
yellow are green because there's yellow

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:37,570
and green for we should start or we

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:39,490
should continue so we're after lunch so

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,799
we thought we'd get you up so if you

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:45,690
want to stand up I know we have to ask

00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:48,610
you to divorce your laptops at devices

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:52,299
you could say it or we could write it

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:53,950
for you you could write it yourself you

00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:55,330
want to write it in private yourself and

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,669
then we just put it on the board that's

00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:00,429
cool too we want to kind of honor how

00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:02,590

on up would you like to come on up or

00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:15,720

rugs there's three colors that's gonna

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,460
take a little bit and yeah let's do it

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,410
anonymously they will just make a stack

00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,410
so want to honor everyone's privacy I

00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,840

tell me I'll say okay we okay team we we

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:46,859

00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:25,210
so once we write all these ideas out or

00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:27,100
some ideas around what we should do what

00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,559
we should stop and what we should

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,669
continue we can read some of them out

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,580
but we could also ask the question

00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:35,500
what's missing you know what should be

00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:38,799
added so these ideas again are gonna go

00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:41,049
into a bath tomorrow at birds of a

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,669
feather and then we have some ideas of

00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:46,059
what we might do with it next in terms

00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:47,620
of how to improve how are we doing we

00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:50,380
need some more colors over here I think

00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,059
we're out of the blue and over here I've

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:55,980
only hit them at the pink so if you have

00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:55,980

nobody told you we'd ask you to do deep

00:33:53,250 --> 00:34:00,510
thinking here right I usually make

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:03,080
people stand up and dance or ask them

00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,080

so maybe you can read there's there's

00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:15,569
livestream okay

00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:18,079
we should start or continue to recognize

00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:22,650
if you're doing more harm than good

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:24,329
when providing your own agenda we all

00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,910
come to the community for different

00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:28,890
reasons stay for different reasons and

00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:32,400
care about different things but

00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:34,019
sometimes you have to pause and

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,970
appreciate others value before

00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:41,700
chastising them we should continue

00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,440
raising awareness on this issue we

00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:48,809
should start including other sectors

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:55,710
such as children and PWDs to be more

00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:59,660
visible on the map we should continue to

00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:04,380
improve our openness towards newcomers

00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:06,989
we should promote our allies we should

00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:11,579
continue supporting initiatives like let

00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:15,960
girls map and osm girls we should do the

00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:20,430
survey every year talking about success

00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,769
and progress not dragging back up old

00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:24,630
mistakes particularly if people have

00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:30,180
made effort to change and be more

00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:32,730
inclusive having safe spaces for women

00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:34,350
to chat and collaborate talk and help

00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:38,580
each other discuss and

00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:44,960
similar issues being faced we should

00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:44,960
start continue considering the LGBTQIA

00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:51,590
in our own mapping projects there's more

00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:54,030
than two genders and all are important

00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:56,880
hearing each other out even if you don't

00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:59,340
agree with the person continuum

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:04,170
marketing osm to special interest groups

00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:06,090
that have a more balanced makeup focus

00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,100
more effort on the racial inequality

00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,810
that exists preventing marginalized

00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,770
communities and communities of color

00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:15,300
from joining the OSM community ie get

00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,760
involved in stem or high school

00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,160
education ie programs that target

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:26,330
education for low-income marginalized

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:29,730
communities osm girls should continue

00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:30,180
tell specific people that we value their

00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,860
story

00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:35,550
tell them to submit a talk to the

00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:38,340
conference add a new tag to define the

00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:42,780
gender of the names of the elements

00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:45,270
example street names insist on

00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:50,760
respectful language parenthesis

00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:52,410
moderation osm girls should continue we

00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,600
should for formalize a code of conduct

00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:57,890
we should have a safe place to report

00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:01,650
code of conduct issues appointment

00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:05,250
moderators on mailing lists we should

00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:08,880
have diversity as an ongoing topic and

00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:10,970
set goals we should start a formal and

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:17,190
confidential way to report harassment

00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:18,810
harassment in or on osm be mindful of

00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:21,120
how inclusion of one group for a

00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:25,080
particular program element might exclude

00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:27,360
other marginalized groups continue to

00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:31,440
actively engage with all minorities to

00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:35,700
increase profile appreciate more other

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,400
people from other cultures give the mic

00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:42,180
to a woman first at every Q&A session at

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,450
state of the map having regular surveys

00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,060
on this

00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:48,470
have a shorthand for calling out our

00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:53,930
microaggressions similar to plus one

00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:56,390
likes up-down vote etc rationale some

00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:58,580
small minor cases of discrimination come

00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:02,450
from ignorance carelessness rather than

00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:04,280
outright malice calling those out is

00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:06,380
justified but unfortunately sometimes

00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,830
raises tensions rather than diffuses

00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:15,110
them we should start having chapters per

00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:21,080
country of geo chicas regional mapathon

00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:22,850
month example mapped Ober we should

00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,650
start having a funding board where

00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:27,830
groups can highlight projects which need

00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:29,990
funding some of us might be able to help

00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:39,520
them out particularly this will help all

00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:39,520
genders seek equal access excellent

00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,200
so we're doing a lot of things and

00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,120
there's a lot of good ideas there and I

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:56,660
asked Rory to be our we should stop so

00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:59,240
you did a Gerber boys oh dear ok ok we

00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,680
should stop this is like you know when

00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,070
your Twitter the opinions are not the

00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:07,160
opinions of my employer I II me we

00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:11,540
should stop cuddling rudeness / excusing

00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:13,730
rudeness we should stop ranking edits

00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,680
and publishing this as a way of showing

00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,780
commitment to the cause we are all

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:26,900
volunteers but maybe our skills are also

00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:29,720
diverse useful useful and toxic

00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,750
discussions / retaliation to different

00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:35,750
points of view yeah we should stop

00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:40,220
unuseful sorry we should stop looking at

00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:42,590
OSF as a tech project we should stop

00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:47,270
making personal attacks and instead

00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:49,580
listen to what others have to say we

00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:57,410
should stop judging other member

00:44:49,580 --> 00:45:00,350
on their motives we should stop this I

00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:03,740
can't read that this in gauging other

00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:08,510
genders on the maps this I'm not sure

00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:14,210
that says we should stop using abusive

00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:16,940
language when communicating where we

00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:18,680
should stop focusing on gender division

00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,450
and start looking at diversity as a

00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,210
broader conversation that's kind of

00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:24,500
intersectionality right there and we

00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:29,870
should stop pretending it isn't a

00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:33,560
problem like I can't read that we should

00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:37,790
stop generalizing on nationality

00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:39,380
yeah well intersectionality there we

00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:40,820
should sorry I probably should give my

00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,950
own comments these are my comments and

00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:46,130
we should stop pointing fingers and

00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:48,590
stereotyping whole organizations slash

00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:53,150
groups as representative of everyone's

00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:55,010
opinion we should stop paying OS MF

00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:58,340
member dues until there is a way to

00:45:55,010 --> 00:46:00,290
report harassment I think you can you

00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:03,950
can just yeah I think you do that anyway

00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:08,960
but we should stop making other people

00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:15,440
uneasy encourage participation we all

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:17,180
have different points of interest and we

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,880
should stop repeatedly and that's

00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:22,400
underlined raising past mistakes when

00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,460
people are trying their absolute hardest

00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,990
to address issues there are lots of more

00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,990
positive ways to participate

00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:35,240
[Music]

00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:38,059
we should stop conflating our sin issues

00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,490
with OS s open-source software developer

00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:42,950
community issues this binds us to the

00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:47,990
quote women in tech and coach issues

00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:51,680
that that are not in general that are

00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:53,270
not general awesome issues and then we

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,039
should stop compromising on the rights

00:46:53,270 --> 00:47:03,109
of marginalized people and have zero

00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:09,559
tolerance for discrimination yeah it's

00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:11,900
hard isn't it it's hard and you're

00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:15,770
writing used to have writing class it's

00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:21,579
your turn just gonna read the I will do

00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:25,299
things how you doing very napping yet no

00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:25,299
I'm not making you dance

00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:44,150
so so I start I will notice diversity

00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:46,910
and lack of diversity where I did not

00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:49,460
think of it in the past I will think

00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:52,340
about how I'm privileged and listened to

00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,620
marginalized voices I will look up

00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,990
whether our same already has a code of

00:47:54,620 --> 00:48:00,800
conduct collaborate on a communist

00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:04,700
community group kaloud calif conducts

00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,970
issues on mailing lists slack IRC etc

00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:10,910
and holds more women in opposition by

00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:13,880
mapping parties i will make a strong

00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:16,490
efforts to bring more diversity gender

00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:19,250
and other to OpenStreetMap community i

00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:20,840
will panting out clearly when the tone

00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:26,210
turns unacceptable

00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:29,300
I will do more is it's a fuse tool for

00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:31,610
community I will listen to the concern

00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,770
of women in OpenStreetMap I will do

00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:36,590
advocate mapping activities on my

00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:38,810
patents that will encourage inclusive

00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:43,070
participation of all genders and sectors

00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:45,410
I will join my local chapter and my

00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:49,010
community of country of origin to

00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:52,370
increase women prisons and I will treat

00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:58,180
others with respect and follow code of

00:48:52,370 --> 00:49:02,030
conduct more involved in discussions I

00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:07,640
will make safe safe bed spaces and

00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:09,860
places for the LGBTQ I a as part of

00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:14,060
including diversity in OpenStreetMap and

00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:16,400
in helping the community as well I will

00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:19,510
encourage more women in my community to

00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:25,670
join and participate in OpenStreetMap

00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:29,150
this was Reza if we stop so insulting

00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:35,440
men women role model is most important

00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:38,780
way to strengthen women okay so

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:42,050
we will close this activity inviting you

00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:44,150
to join to continue the debate joining

00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:46,940
the mailing list of diversity that the

00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:53,110
foundation has everybody know has to

00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:57,080
join the mailing list yeah okay and for

00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:59,390
female gender you can integrate her

00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:02,210
chicas to the main language is Spanish

00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:06,800
but we we always we always switched to

00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:09,740
English when necessary and we would like

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,200
to build a working group on gender so

00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:14,870
the mailing list under waste diversity

00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:18,530
is important to start to share specific

00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:20,840
ideas to start on working on that so you

00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:27,080
want to add something a working group on

00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:31,160
community okay on diversity on community

starting fires and thank each of you for

00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:51,140
