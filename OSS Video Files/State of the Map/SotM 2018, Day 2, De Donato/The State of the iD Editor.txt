all right welcome so i'm brian i'm the

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,990
maintainer for the ID editor this is the

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,790
default editor that you can use on

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,530
OpenStreetMap unless you edit the map

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,820
right from your browser so we've got a

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,040
lot to go through today I'm going to

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,160
like super fast to get it all in five

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,779
minutes every good talk needs like an

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,520
ask so I'm just gonna like lead right

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,439
off with it we are at an open source

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,210
project on github so please check us out

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,740
there's lots of opportunities for new

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,199
contributors to jump in and help out

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,760
with stuff you can add presets fix bugs

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,040
that don't require too much knowledge of

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,980
the code so this is my cry for help

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,690
right here please we even text some

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,290
issues like good first issue which is

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,360
great for new contributors so where are

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,030
we today with ID ID is currently at

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,160
version 2.1 we just released a new

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,600
version last Thursday and I try to

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,579
release a new minor version like maybe

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,860
once a month or so so sometimes we'll go

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,910
a few months without a release but that

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,890
just means we're working on something

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,850
bigger in this talk I'm going to

00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,879
highlight some of the accomplishments

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,649
that we've made over the past year so we

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,920
could go all the way back to July 7th

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,270
last year we were at version 2.3 ID has

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,610
always been designed primarily for

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,049
beginners who've never mapped before so

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,610
we've added this new user interface

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,810
pattern across the bottom you'll see

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,280
these advanced features that were

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,750
previously considered out of scope for

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,590
ID because we didn't want to scare off

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,420
the new users

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,070
these are info panels that kind of stack

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,600
up along the bottom of the screen you

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,759
can show or hide them with a keyboard

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,049
shortcut so we've got like background

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,600
shows you information about the current

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,220
imagery like the date it was captured

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,229
history will show you who left edited

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,610
the selected feature location will show

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,189
you the coordinates at the mouse like

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,540
the latitude longitude doesn't nominate

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,590
them lookup also just so you can see

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,240
like where you're editing and

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,090
measurement lets you measure length and

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,170
area and distance and things like that

00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,820
and by the way you can discover these

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,979
commands on our new keyboard shortcut

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,659
screen so shout out to Kushan actually

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,310
who is he helped work on this feature

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,810
you can bring it up just by pressing

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,500
question mark anytime while you're

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,360
editing this it's pretty useful then

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,009
later in July with version 2 3 2 we

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,630
added some mapillary improvements and

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,189
Kushan worked on this feature too now we

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,990
fetched the street sign detections from

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,170
their map Larry API and highlight them

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,789
down in the viewer

00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,349
moving on to version 2.4 released in

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,750
August we added some things to the save

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,670
screen so we extract hash tags from the

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,349
comment and put them

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,760
their own changeset tag this could

00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:18,500
eventually let people perform better

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,050
analysis of change sets and maybe even

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,950
lead to less noisy comments some people

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,810
really don't like to see all those

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,360
hashtags in the comments so now there's

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,069
a place for them also new on this screen

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,540
the review request checkbox for users

00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:30,890
who are maybe a little unsure of their

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,260
work and want some feedback about what

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,510
they did these get highlighted in tools

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,010
like osm cha and Pascal nieces tools so

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,810
we'd love to see some more experienced

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,280
users step in to review the new users

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,930
work and give them some feedback then on

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,670
inversion 2.4 we also landed ESRI World

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,560
imagery background layers so big thanks

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,269
to Sam Libby and John Garbo and the rest

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,569
of the team at SOE so thank you to them

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:55,040
for that version 2.5 and November we

00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:56,840
added support for open street cam so

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,739
thank you to martin team from TeleNav

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,720
for helping Lanice moving on to January

00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:04,430
of this year version 2.6 this release

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,500
included some new tricks to let mappers

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,760
enhance the background imagery so you

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,620
can like crank up the brightness or

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,000
contrast or adjust the saturation and

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,590
even sharpen the imagery a little bit

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,250
this one is like kind of fun to play

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,140
with and turns out to be really useful

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,640
then version 2.6 we also upgraded a

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,400
bunch of the presets to support public

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,109
transport v2 like yeah I know v3 is in

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,489
the pipeline but you could check out the

00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:27,230
cool icons on the side so we do our best

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,090
to let mappers map all those like stop

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,840
locations and platforms and stuff like

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,160
that then in march version 2.7 we

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,780
released a big update to the turn

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,549
restrictions editor so now it supports

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,799
adding VOA restrictions and only

00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:40,670
restrictions it also highlights the

00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,930
paths that you take through the

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,160
intersection so that you can really

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,660
understand the effect of what you're

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,350
doing

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,000
violators are important for mapping

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,950
things like no u-turn across a dual

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,090
carriageway and this example shows me

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,350
adding some only straight-on

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,239
restrictions to simplify this

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,750
channelized intersection like you can

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,190
only go certain ways through it in April

00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,480
and version 2.8 we changed the screen

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,709
that we show to the users after they

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,600
save their edits so we have a new

00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,579
community index project we use this to

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,980
display local osm meetups user groups

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,079
and events like state of the map us sign

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,760
up we deliberately use language on this

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,930
screen targeted to newer mappers to let

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,989
them know that there are people who care

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,639
about the map that they are editing then

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,919
last month we added support for being

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,780
Street side so this brings in 360 degree

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,000
panoramic imagery across large portions

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,229
of the US UK France and Spain thank you

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,460
to Jubal Harpster and the team at

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:29,070
Microsoft for making this possible

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,539
finally well almost finally then last

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,310
Thursday with version 210 we released

00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:33,449
support for the OSM notes this is work

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,250
done by our google Summer of Code

00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,169
student Thomas Irving and mentor mark

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,310
Farah at development seed here we

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,169
located all the notes around New York

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,580
City obviously there's a lot of work to

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:43,320
do to close these but mappers can

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,500
comment on closed reopen and even add

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,820
new notes right from within ID we also

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,830
snuck in a few other cool features to

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,360
version 2:10 one of our contributors CEO

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,770
I don't know if that is but he added a

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,330
command to let you detach a node from

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,979
away and move it someplace else it

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,300
really feels like magic when you just

00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,949
like pick a node like this bollard and

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,330
hit the e key and just like pulls right

00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,160
to your cursor it's pretty cool

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,539
finally shout out to Mateus for

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,160
mapillary who made it possible to resize

00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:06,930
the viewer window so this works for all

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,120
the FOA layers mapillary open street cam

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,070
and Street side that is all the time I

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,539
have thank you again check us out follow

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,539
us and star the ivy project on github

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,420
