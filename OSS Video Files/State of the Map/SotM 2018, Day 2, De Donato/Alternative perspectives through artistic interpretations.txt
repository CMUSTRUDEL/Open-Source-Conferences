Description: 
	Sebastian Meier / Hans Hack (Maptime & Vislab / Hans Hack), State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/T095-Alternative_perspectives_through_artistic_interpretations

The talk will be given by Hans Hack and Sebastian Meier. The talk will focus on alternative perspectives onto our environment and space through artistic interpretations of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Visual cartographic representations do not only help us navigate the world, they shape our image of the world. Through our work we are challenging those perspectives by rearranging, re-contextualizing and reinterpreting OSM data and, thereby, try to go beyond standardized representations. From re-contextualizing foreign cartographies in well-known local spaces (http://hanshack.com/aleppo) to creating personal psychogeographic maps from individual's spatio-temporal trajectories (http://www.vislab.io/projects/mentalmaps). More examples of our work can be found here: http://hanshack.com/pointnemo/, http://hanshack.com/inselwelt/, http://hanshack.com/sorted-cities/, http://hanshack.com/brusslescutouts/, http://www.vislab.io/projects/green

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,279
yeah good morning everyone I guess most

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,400
are still hangover from last night

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,250
so we are happy to kick off today I hope

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,080
everybody's awake yeah I'm Sebastian

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,109
this is Hans we're going to introduce us

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,090
in a minute and we are I guess a little

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,609
bit off most of the other talks which

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,279
are very technical or community driven

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,590
but we're instead talking about artistic

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,380
perspectives making use of urban street

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,420
map data

00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,940
yeah I'm Sebastian I'm I work for a

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,360
foundation in Berlin and we are doing

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,670
advocacy for open data and open source

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,160
technologies for the government in

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,860
Berlin and besides that I'm also a

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:50,520
freelancer working on data visualization

00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:54,680
especially on geospatial data and ok hi

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,230
my name is Hans Hawk I'm a web developer

00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,149
working the field of data visualization

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,420
mainly with maps and of course a lot of

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,250
Open Street Map data so they thank you

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,280
to the Open Street Map community here

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,400
without it my a lot of my work would not

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,140
be possible so today I'm going to show

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,270
you some of my work that give some

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,420
alternatives perspectives onto our

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,659
environment a lot of my projects start

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,990
with a question I asked myself that rise

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,560
from political and social contexts the

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,799
first work I will show you today

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,200
reprojected destruction came to be in

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,310
2017 when the fighting in a leopard took

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:42,710
place and the city got heavily destroyed

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,450
I wanted to grasp the extent of extract

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:48,780
destruction so what is being talked

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,770
about in the news how can I approach

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,329
this issue as a mapmaker so I did some

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,090
research and I came across an

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,490
interesting data set from the UN which

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,969
showed how strongly the buildings were

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,860
damaged in East district of Aleppo this

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,220
gave me the idea to reproject the data

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,869
set the

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:13,470
Lepus districts on to berlin and its

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,750
buildings as a geographical reference

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,290
point i superimposed the historical

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,130
center of aleppo the citadel of aleppo

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:25,440
on to that of berlin the museum Island

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,070
then I wrote a script that randomly

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,250
selects the amount of buildings

00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:34,980
destroyed in each quarter I published a

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,810
map the result as an interactive map

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:42,480
I also added London so because that's

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,730
another place I'm familiar with so the

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,040
building's marked in red you can see on

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,220
a map here show the buildings destroyed

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:55,290
head to war waged in Berlin or London

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:58,680
you can also blend in data layer to see

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,630
the actual numbers the project was well

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,060
received by the press especially in

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,930
Berlin probably because it took

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:11,450
something unimaginable to a familiar

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:13,170
place another example for

00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,920
recontextualizing and taking something

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,660
perhaps unfamiliar to a familiar place

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,510
it's a work I did for the newspaper

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,200
Villa de Morgan post when Trump

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,299
announced to build a wall along the

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,350
us-mexican border the website allows you

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:33,480
to drag that wall along the world to a

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,060
place that maybe you might be more

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,220
familiar with so you can get a grasp and

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,989
understanding what it what what is

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,670
actually being talked about the next

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,620
project I'm going to show you was not

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,080
about what you see on a normal map but

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,799
what you don't see so to say to read

00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,989
between the lines the project arose from

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,360
feeling I sometimes have in bilenda it

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,860
just seems impossible to get away from

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:05,549
the street from the feeling of

00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:07,739
civilization pollution noise I also

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,200
noticed this even traveling around the

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:13,350
German countryside so this made me

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,739
curious where can I find a place that is

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,190
as far away possible from a street so

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,580
downloaded

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:25,810
the OSM data set for Germany from Giro

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:30,490
fabric extracted the streets with osm

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:34,410
filter then I imported the data set into

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:39,250
puskÃ¡s and laid out raster point layer

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:42,490
meaning like width of points in a

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,890
distance of 200 meters to each other and

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,350
then I queried for every point how far

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:50,740
that point is away from the nearest

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:55,030
street the result is an interactive map

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:57,130
made with taya mill and leaflet so in

00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,380
case you were wondering the furthest

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:04,980
point away from the street in Germany is

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:07,780
in the North Sea found on sand Bank and

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,740
tranquility if you're looking for it in

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:15,180
Germany you can find in general in

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:20,650
Islands mountainous areas lakes and

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:24,880
military proving grounds the we the

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:27,310
project was very received and I even got

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,120
someone that wants to visit one of these

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:33,190
places the last project I'm going to

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,020
show you is about putting a new light on

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:39,580
existing geometries I am fascinated by

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:44,680
the aesthetics of maps especially

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:47,680
building footprints maybe yeah so

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,490
extracted a selection of houses from osm

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,919
and just played around with them so what

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,460
really spoke to me aesthetically was

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,110
sorting the building footprints by size

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:03,220
my aim became to autumn eyes this

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:06,250
project for large datasets and for

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,570
example for city for whole cities and

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,810
city quarters

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,800
I therefore made a tool which allows me

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:19,090
to do just that

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:20,760
and the tool also allows me to to select

00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:24,090
only churches or

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,010
prisons and so on what I liked about

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:30,600
this project maybe you can go show the

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:33,510
gallery also what I liked about this

00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,150
project was that people started to look

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:40,500
at these images and asked himself what

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:43,590
certain buildings were what their

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,440
building was or what the function of

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:50,180
that building was and start to compare

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:54,360
like their city to other cities and

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:57,900
rediscovering their own environment on

00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,470
the website I also included a tool that

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,560
lets you sort a small area of the map

00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,840
yourself so here you can see Milan like

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,220
the area where now the university area

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,980
and then it makes you a poster like this

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,900
and you can even download it as an SVG

00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:20,940
and print it out so I invite you to play

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,870
around the tool and perhaps you will see

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:28,160
your own area in a different a new light

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,160
thank you for listening

00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:37,020
[Applause]

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,300
yes so my work is kind of at the

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,830
intersection because I'm actually more

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,080
into the research field so it's

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:48,540
somewhere at the intersection of Arts

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,610
and research so I was working a lot on

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,530
mental models so how do people actually

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,330
remember the places around them how do

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,130
people make sense of the city how do

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,170
people find their way around the city

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,210
and while doing this research I came

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:03,150
across the defendant of French

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:06,240
Situationist movement from the 1960s and

00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:08,520
they were much concerned about how we as

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,220
human beings perceive the city what are

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,290
our subjective impressions that we get

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,720
when we walk through cities and this for

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:18,570
example is a work by guy debord who was

00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,460
living in Paris / Paris at the time he

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,880
was doing this and he created all these

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,950
great drawings of how he is remembering

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,440
the city how he is perceiving the city

00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,930
so I was thinking okay is there maybe a

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,360
way of how we can do this today but

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,370
maybe not from this kind of okay we need

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,200
to draw these nice images but maybe

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,450
there's a data-driven way that we can

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,580
create these kind of personal personal

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,560
impressions of how we remember the

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,900
cities and create these kind of personal

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:50,520
images of what our own cities look like

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,589
so I started collecting some data I

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,589
asked a lot of my students to collect

00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:57,330
data for me and at the time the the

00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,230
easiest way to do it was the the the

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,790
moose app the moose egg was a was

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,740
acquired by Facebook sadly a few years

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,690
ago and was discontinued just a few

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,210
weeks ago so you cannot use it anymore

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,680
sadly but it was a nice way because it

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,780
collects the spatial temporal

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,480
trajectories where people walk and also

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:18,150
already does a classification so is this

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,930
somebody walking somebody cycling is he

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:24,260
or she going but by train or by car etc

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:29,810
so you get this really nice already pre

00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:33,450
classified data set of trajectories and

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:36,030
and so then I came across a really

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,920
interesting paper so this is by a

00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,980
research group about a

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,899
moonshine at AI and what they've found

00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,660
out something that is actually quite

00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,630
obvious so they were interested how does

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,430
the the way you move around the city

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,310
changed the way you memorize the city

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,529
and obviously the slower you move around

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:58,949
the city the more you memorize but also

00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:01,740
the more self-controlled you move around

00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:03,540
the environment the more you remember so

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,029
of course if you walk around the city by

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,579
your own then you remember most if you

00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:10,170
on your cycle bicycle for example then

00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:12,540
you also need to figure out how to get

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,579
from A to B so you remember more if

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,560
you're in a car it gets a little bit

00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:18,329
less because you're passing faster

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,740
through the environment and for example

00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:22,350
if you're in a bus so you know driving

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,240
yourself it gets less and less that you

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,810
actually remember the environment you're

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,589
in so I wrote an algorithm to implement

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:33,870
the psycho psychological model that this

00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:36,240
research group developed and combined it

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,589
with the trajectory data that I gathered

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,589
through the moves application

00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,089
so did the moves app over a year time

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:55,320
the the participants were collecting the

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:58,019
data and so also in the back this the

00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,199
data I received I also used the map

00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,639
matching technique to actually get the

00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:04,230
correct streets the people were

00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,750
traveling on and I also used a mobile

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,810
street map for for the street data and

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:14,190
the map matching matching technique but

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:16,889
in the end I was most interested in of

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,839
using the the building so the actual

00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:21,510
physical environment that we walk

00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,300
through as kind of a canvas to print our

00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,959
memorization kind of index I developed

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,449
on so what we can see somebody traveling

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,430
on a road several times and now we can

00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:34,320
see that the buildings around this road

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,750
are collected and we create this kind of

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,130
environment that the user traveled

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:43,889
through so in the end I created this of

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,660
the city and what we can see here is

00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:47,760
what I then later called the walking

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,279
Islands so this is the areas that people

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,380
that one person here spend a lot of time

00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,720
in and that they remember is very very

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,820
well so the darker the areas here the

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,740
more memorized the area is and what was

00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,839
quite interesting is that for most

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,329
participants they had is these small

00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,490
islands like splattered across the city

00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:11,430
and those those little islands are then

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:17,910
connected by by other types of so in a

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:19,829
second we should so now we see that this

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,990
kind of network developing how those

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:23,820
islands are connected and of course some

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,279
islands are stronger connected some a

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,380
weaker connected and to get this kind of

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,420
situation is expression I try to then

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:35,430
reorganize the city in this kind of

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:37,890
network because what is quite yet

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,380
loosely connected places that there's a

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:43,500
lot of research that people often don't

00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,120
even realize how these loose kind of

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,360
islands are connected with one another

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,190
so for example during the the planning

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,870
for the Olympics in London there was

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,860
some really interesting geographers

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,240
going into the

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,790
City and trying to figure out how they

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,350
can improve the navigation system in the

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,870
city and they found out that even

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,810
Londoners who lived there for like years

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,790
and decades often don't now how to Tube

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,200
stations are connected in the real world

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,480
because they just remembered as this

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,310
this famous tube plan and how the city

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,170
runs but they often they don't know that

00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,640
for example - tube station that take

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,620
quite a lot of time because you need to

00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,850
change to another train I actually quite

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,070
close to another and you could just walk

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,020
between them so they created these

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:26,100
interesting maps on the street where

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,300
they show how far things to walk to just

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,130
show people that they can actually

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,960
sometimes walk instead of taking the

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,880
train so it's quite interesting to see

00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,800
that people often don't realize how

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,820
these loosely connected places are

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:42,960
actually connected to each other so in

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:45,180
the end I am try to create like a more

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,030
physical artifact for the participants

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:50,220
so that they could kind of reflect on

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,730
their own behavior in the city so I

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,590
created these big 3d printed yeah city

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,050
maps the height of the building again

00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,690
represents the the memorization index or

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:03,630
how well they know the city and like

00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,910
looking at those kind of artifacts that

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,380
the people I'm started readers okay this

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,600
was the area where I do this and there

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,450
and they son Liam started memorizing

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,730
certain events in the city where they

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,610
traveled through those places and of

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,710
course it's not a correct representation

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,410
of the city but more like a very

00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:24,930
personal artifact that it can create

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,570
from your behavior in the city and all

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:31,410
this is built on OpenStreetMap data so

00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:36,690
and all the little physical yeah

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:38,550
artifacts that that the shape of the 3d

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:49,080
print was all taken from the

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:52,380
OpenStreetMap data and yes so I think to

00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:55,470
kind of sum up and combine our talks we

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:58,380
by just challenging how we see the city

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:00,720
because especially maps they don't only

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,220
help us to to travel through the city or

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,590
to find certain places but they also

00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,650
kind of shape how we perceive our

00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,930
environment there

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:10,230
often referred to tools of power because

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,160
they represent these kind of

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,710
representations of the world that are

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,210
shaped by us the mapmakers and so it's

00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,580
quite we think it's quite important to

00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:21,310
sometimes challenge these standardized

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,920
views of the world and create some new

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,320
novel representations and visualizations

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,650
how we can see our environment and get

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,720
some some new perspectives and we're

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,960
almost at the end so yeah one last

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,480
promotion and maybe you didn't have

00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,010
enough from last night's celebrations so

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,279
tonight I will be livid of more

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:44,680
celebration and together as Eno over

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,930
there I'm organizing a meet-up in Berlin

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,790
and there's it's called map time and

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:52,560
there's also map time here in Milan and

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,970
so we teamed up and first is going to be

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,640
collaboration with the poly mappers from

00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,580
Milan we're just going to have a very

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,850
feature Lam rata I hope I did it almost

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,520
correctly and later on we will move to

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,290
Balor Adele or teacher for more

00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,660
celebrating so if you're interested for

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,660
drinking some more beers tonight join us

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:18,689
[Applause]

00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:21,269
so if you have any questions actually

00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:23,249
most of our work is on github so if

00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,709
you're interested in reproducing what we

00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:37,279
showed there's a lot of code on the web

00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:39,989
but okay first question hi Thank You

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,559
iris what seems fantastic and I really

00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:45,689
liked the building Salter and I wondered

00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:48,629
if you did if you would be able to use

00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:51,749
it in say rural Africa because we were

00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:53,790
talking yesterday about what Chad was

00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:56,040
saying about the problems you know

00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,679
working out what this building was and I

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:03,919
wondered if your tool could potentially

00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:12,360
be used for something like that a

00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:15,779
verification tool if you analyze schools

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:25,110
in rural Tanzania yeah but quite often

00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:27,899
they have particular shapes yeah yeah I

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:30,210
guess so but it's not the main purpose

00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:32,970
like it's not verification tool really

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,649
so it's not highly scientific but I I

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,159
guess you could you definitely use it

00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:42,630
yeah sure I think you would need more

00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:44,240
like because in your case that the extra

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,620
shape is more interesting than the size

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,139
so it's probably more interesting to

00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,880
look at the actual shape and for example

00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:53,880
if there's a courtyard or something if

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,399
this is a specific attribute feature of

00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,019
schools and of course that could be

00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:00,019
easily built and something like that

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:20,289
yeah another question I've seen already

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:24,490
somebody okay I was just wondering how

00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:26,289
much trace data do you have and is that

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,720
publicly available it's the obvious

00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:30,580
question because having the mode of

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,770
transport might be interesting to

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:36,010
analyze stuff that is missing you know a

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:38,409
saying or something like that what kind

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:42,669
of the trace data that you got out of

00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:45,610
moves the segment's I mean I got it from

00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:47,380
ten participants for sure it's not that

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,690
much and I was also very much concerned

00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,890
about privacy so I built a kind of

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:55,149
stand-alone system that yet the the

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,730
participants uploaded their data on a

00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:59,799
local machine the maps and everything

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,419
was generated and they could then take

00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,580
it out again so I didn't even use an

00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:05,169
online service just to make the

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,490
participants feel really safe about

00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,770
their private data because

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,179
spatial-temporal data is really hard to

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,940
anonymize especially if you you have a

00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:14,770
very very small sample so it would be

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,860
very easy to identify the individuals

00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:20,890
from the data so yeah yeah I would agree

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:24,250
I didn't know how many users you had ten

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,080
is two orders of magnitude less at least

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,649
but but I think it's definitely

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,240
interesting to think about ways of

00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:33,010
extending the O's and data set with

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,260
trajectory data's and finding ways to

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,299
probably anonymize data because this

00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,399
would be like a really interesting data

00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:43,840
set for for researchers and also for

00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:51,179
city planners to work with so okay maybe

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:51,179
we have one last question okay

00:19:53,390 --> 00:20:00,600
so I have a question for you so you sure

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,460
that for example you use this

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,710
application loose that now is

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,220
discontinued and I would like to know if

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,690
you have any suggestion with possible

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,180
alternatives or some software that you

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,770
can suggest to us Thanks

00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,930
actually I don't so over the last few

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,330
weeks I've tested a lot of tracking

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,970
software I also for example tried out

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,500
Google for a few months now Hester's I

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,560
think it's called timeline or something

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,080
and it's really really really bad I mean

00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,570
I was really I mean it's it's Google so

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,610
I was yeah it's really really bad and I

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,610
couldn't also find any alternatives and

00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,800
what was especially interesting about

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,570
most verse that before they were bought

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,580
by Facebook they had very strict privacy

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,400
policy and you were also able to

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,440
download all of your data and a lot of

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,020
new companies especially those like

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,670
Fitbit and a lot of other companies they

00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,860
don't allow you to download your

00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,570
complete data with all the metadata and

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,940
everything they just give you like small

00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,580
snippets and aggregated data and

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,800
compressed data so I haven't really

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:05,010
found a proper solution yet so if

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:08,310
anybody has a tip on any spatial

00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:12,330
temporal trajectory tracking ads I'm

00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:13,020
happy to hear okay so thank you

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,820

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,270
