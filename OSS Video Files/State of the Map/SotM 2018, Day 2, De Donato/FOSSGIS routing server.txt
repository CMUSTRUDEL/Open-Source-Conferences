Previously, all world wide, OSM based routing services were backed by commercial entities. The FOSSGIS routing server started in late 2017 and aims to provide a community driven routing service based on OSM data. This lightning talk should promote the service and give a short explanation how it is set up.

thank you hello everyone my talk is

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,269
about routing routing doubt

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:13,590
OpenStreetMap de or the fuscus routing

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:16,379
server so what is it it's a routing

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,100
instance obviously with OpenStreetMap

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:25,920
data and it supports pedestrian cyclists

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:29,580
and car routing why this routing

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,679
instance all the routing servers on

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,250
OpenStreetMap to torg are run by

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,410
commercial entities right now so the

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,940
idea was to start and independence and

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:45,629
community driven server the server is

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,170
sponsored by fuscus for those who don't

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,789
know first case is the German

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,070
association for free and open source

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:58,770
software for GIS and also they are now

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:04,530
the local the official local chapter of

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:07,860
the OSM foundation the sponsoring is for

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,400
ya offering routing on OpenStreetMap te

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,040
and possibly street map tool org and to

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,540
support pedestrian and cyclist routing

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,540
and to have worldwide coverage

00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:25,380
so this routing needs quite a bit of

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:29,299
hardware it runs on two servers both

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:32,479
have six cores and 256 kilobytes of RAM

00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:36,140
one server is mainly concerned with

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:41,130
pre-processing and the other server will

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:43,740
deliver the routing results with the

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,869
exception that not all the routing

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,149
profiles can be run on one server

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,710
because of the memory constraint so a

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:55,860
little bit is on one server server one

00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:01,140
as well the software that we that they

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:04,770
are running is OS RM y OS RM will it's

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:09,060
very fast it can easily handle very long

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,600
routes so if we want to be able to run

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,910
it on OpenStreetMap torque we have

00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,810
to be able to handle a lot so lots of

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:20,620
requests it comes at the price that

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,650
there is little customization so we have

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,240
three profiles like I mentioned for

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:31,040
cyclists for pedestrians and for cars

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:33,680
but you cannot customize it like as a

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,870
cyclist you want to avoid gravel roads

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,570
because you have a road bike or you

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:44,750
prefer less busy roads be a bit slower

00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:48,020
we don't have hate data currently yeah

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,640
so please give it a try its online since

00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,740
this year under routing that

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,480
OpenStreetMap dots de and I hope it will

00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:01,150
soon be available on OpenStreetMap that

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:05,750
org and last but not least this is

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:09,050
supposed to be a community project all

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:12,920
the software is open source which I put

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,540
together on the servers you can see all

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:19,340
the software that's used on the about

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:21,890
page please use it report errors report

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,790
bad routes maybe you can even help

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:28,280
improve the profiles report problems on

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:33,530
github or by mail whatever you like you

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:36,740
can talk to me thank you thanks Michael

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,220
for this Versace routine sir very fun is

00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,220
