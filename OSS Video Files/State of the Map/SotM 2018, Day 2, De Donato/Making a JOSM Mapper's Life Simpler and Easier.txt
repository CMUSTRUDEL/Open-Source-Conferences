Title: Making a JOSM Mapper's Life Simpler and Easier

In this talk, the Telenav Mapping team will share some of the custom MapCSS, filters, presets and plugins we use to improve the appearance and functionality of JOSM to make our editing more effective and efficient. Even if you consider yourself a JOSM power user, you may learn a thing or two â€” and we hope to learn some tricks from you as well.

okay yeah okay sorry I so I missed one

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,700
I work at Dillon now and I want to show

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,460
you a couple of things to modify things

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,240
awesome so we can make editing a little

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,490
simpler and easier

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,609
at first glance just might seem a little

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:27,240
complicated but there are certain things

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:30,990
we can modify and in order to make

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,510
things easier we are going to take a

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,079
look at filters map CSS presets and

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,500
shortcuts and plugins so this is the

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,739
center of Milan right the main thing to

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,750
start out with the start filtering data

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:50,579
for a specific mapping project we can

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:53,219
hide for example buildings or parks so

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,489
after that we can instantly see that

00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:01,579
there's residential roads left a few

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,579
foot ways maybe a tertiary up north

00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:07,140
after filtering out the data we can

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,840
start customizing them the default

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,510
drawsome style is quite good and once

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,820
you understand what the tags and the

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,000
colors represent you can start adding to

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,180
this and start building up on this so on

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,920
the left side I have a map CSS that

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:29,400
watches for modified layers this helps

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,490
you see things that you've modified in

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,530
your currently downloaded area and on

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:39,150
the left side on the right side we have

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:42,360
a CSS with a blue casing blue

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:47,729
transparent casing which watches for

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:50,250
recently modified object this helps to

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:54,090
see how all or fresh the data is and

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,310
also to know directly that a way has

00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,630
been recently modified without having to

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:04,369
check its history for the US for example

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:08,550
we can highlight tiger reviewed no tag

00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:09,580
this also helps identify places where

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,930
the tiger import

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:17,830
would be corrected or modified or even

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,930
deleted and this example I have the tree

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,630
come with the combination of these three

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:26,140
styles all together so we can identify

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:29,340
that the those alleys were recently

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:32,680
added because it has a light blue casing

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,250
with a purplish color we have the tiger

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,710
reviewed now and there's this the other

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,080
color orange II combined with purple

00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:44,470
those are the ones that still have Tiger

00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,910
know but I've modified them and that's

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:50,320
right

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:53,320
there's also QA scoped map styles for

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,690
this example here we have with red

00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,290
casing highlighted the streets that have

00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,080
no names

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,010
this helps identify ways that are not

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,830
tagged correctly and with pink I have

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,780
the link road symbolized so we can

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,080
instantly see that in the southern part

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,940
that link is not tagged properly because

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,420
it should be pink because it's a

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:21,220
secondary link for roundabouts for

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:23,260
example if we set the Scion blue for the

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,910
roundabout and you get used to the fact

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:31,840
that this is how a roundabout should

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:34,030
look like then whenever you see a

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,980
circular geometry you're going to

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,340
realize that the junction around about

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:42,160
tag is missing

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,950
using status for turn instructions draws

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,660
attention upon the membership on how

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,430
long the ways are and whether they

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,670
should be clipped at intersections or

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:55,510
not and and you can also make the icon

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:57,550
size larger in this case the front ways

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,989
are highlighted with blue and the two

00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:05,260
ways are highlighted with purple you can

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,510
also bring out places where people added

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:12,730
hundreds of no u-turns in parking lots

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:15,459
and parking grass after styling is done

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,320
we want to create custom presets and

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,299
shortcuts so there's two ways of

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,280
creating the presets either by writing

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:22,800
the X

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,350
called yourself or by using a plug-in

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,180
called easy presets creator which is a

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,970
pretty straightforward and easy to use

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,040
plug-in and once you've created the

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,320
custom preset you wanted you can just

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,270
simply add them to your toolbar have a

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,820
shortcut there and then you can assign

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,910
any keyboard shortcut combination and

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:45,270
this really improves the speed of the

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:48,360
editing and this is how my view

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:51,240
generally looks like when I work I if we

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,910
work on two monitors I recommend moving

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,010
all the windows on another monitor cuz

00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:00,600
we all know the struggle of how crowded

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:04,440
it can get and a couple of men of

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,840
plugins dimensions or the OSM object

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,290
info which I find really helpful because

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,169
it provides quick links to immediately

00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:18,540
see a person's profile or a ways history

00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:20,669
or directly to OSF cha another plugin

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,750
would be the change sets plug-in which

00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:27,320
helps for peer review purposes I think

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,320
that's it

00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:40,180
so do we have any questions for this

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,680
first I think though if you have any

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,630
questions later you can find me at the

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,130
dilemma booth and I'll show you more

00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:50,610
examples and use cases

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,610
Thanks ok thank you

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,879
