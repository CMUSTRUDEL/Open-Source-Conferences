we reach about 12,000 we have 12,000

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:51,629
hits per month so it's not as bad and

00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:54,469
the comments which we receive from the

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:59,129
community is not as bad neither

00:00:54,469 --> 00:01:02,160
okay some statistics but as it is a very

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,180
short talk I can not talk about this but

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,860
you can read it

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:12,619
my name is Manfred akka there Fred I am

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:16,409

south west of Germany near French and

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,450
Luxembourg border okay we have a new

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,299
tool for you we have created a new tool

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,570
how you can reach the audience why our

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:39,600
weekly osm and that is and you can get

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:43,970
here HTTPS OS MBC OpenStreetMap de + OS

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,259
NBC means OpenStreetMap block collector

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,720
the only thing you need for the

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:53,100
OpenStreetMap block collector is an

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,799
guest it is an OS M account and you

00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:02,009
enter if you are going there you enter

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:05,890
in the guest mode and if you log in you

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:09,759
have to login by your OS m account

00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:11,830
I explained very quickly what we have

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,410
here you can see here we publish in

00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:22,330
German English Spanish Japanese French

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:25,750
and Korean and in Czech you will not

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:29,650
find here check as a language because

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:32,200
patrons they don't work within our block

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,360
collector this is a special content

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,910
management system which was specially

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:43,180
created for us for our needs check by

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,760
translate from HTML directly to to check

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:49,959
the language and they publish it in our

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:53,950
weekly awesome base Korean is very new

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:57,670
and I can tell you that probably we will

00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:01,170
have a Swahili in the future as well

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,170
thanks to Joffrey

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:11,140
ok if you look if you log in you see

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:14,560
here you see here the language is the

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,780
next thing you see that are the number

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,140
in which we are working at the moment

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,140
and here you can see what is with the to

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,900
400 with the number 418 we just publish

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:32,739
it if you are going now and you enter

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,320
you see here the colors are changed only

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:37,480
to explain what the colors means the

00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,360
green one means that this version is

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:46,959
published and we can and you can see

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:49,950
here this is in the review and we have

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,780
one review for the English version so

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,720
that's more or less the information you

00:03:52,780 --> 00:04:00,010
can get but if you would like to inform

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:03,170
your if you would like to give your

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,520
information to weekly OSM the only thing

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:11,390
you have to do is submit an article and

00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:16,609
the it is an end you are here and this

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:20,359
is a weary or a very poor side what we

00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:24,320
expect here is a link nothing more as a

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:28,130
link a link where you published you the

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,800
things you would like to inform the the

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,229
community please have in mind we always

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,430
need a link it can be a link to a blog

00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:39,650
link to Twitter a link to whatever

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:43,430
because weekly Azam doesn't create

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:47,750
content we only report about existing

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:51,380
content in the USM community so and this

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:55,639
one this link will be checked whether it

00:04:51,380 --> 00:05:01,340
just exists in weekly osm or not so we

00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:07,460
avoid duplicate entrances I put here in

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:11,750
the link and then opens AMA another

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,640
window and here you can choose you can

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,130
choose the category which you know from

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:26,479
weekly osm where it should appear in

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:28,850
weekly OSM this is the category and if

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,380
you have choosen the category you click

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:37,100
on the ok' button and that's it if you

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:42,200
are very friendly to our editors you can

00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:47,750
write the text here what it is about and

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:51,440
if you would like you can translate it

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:54,919
to another language as well but it's not

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,160
necessary to write the content if you

00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:02,300
only give us the link we will try to do

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,090
it but I think it's better if you write

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,610
it yourself because you know much more

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,360
about the content as we have to do and

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,969
we

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:21,710
to think about what it is about okay

00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:25,039
here I wrote some of our servers to new

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:27,819
home you can see here it is written in

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:31,400
markdown and it is translated from

00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:34,879
markdown to HTML directly within the

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:40,210
system so you only right here in

00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:44,199
markdown and once again you save and

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,060
that's it but please give us your email

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:51,039
the email is really important

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:54,349
the email is necessary because if other

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,169
editors would like to go in contact with

00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:02,560
you that I can do it with within the

00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:06,080
system so that's why we need your email

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:12,319
you can reach your email here clicking

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:19,639
you're in this avatar and then you put

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:22,190
your email you say ok and that's once

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:27,310
again the link where you have to go to

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:37,240
inform the community oops

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:37,240
you're welcome any question

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:53,289
there was a question no okay

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:56,949
now and we created this this guest mode

00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:59,949
because we need your input we normally

00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:02,470
read mailing lists we read blogs and so

00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:05,289
on and so on and that's absolutely

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:08,949
annoying and we miss from time to time

00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:12,250
we miss some special things and we

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:14,020
kindly ask you to inform us about what

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:20,380
is necessary for the community

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:23,230
any other question okay thanks a lot and

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:28,680
