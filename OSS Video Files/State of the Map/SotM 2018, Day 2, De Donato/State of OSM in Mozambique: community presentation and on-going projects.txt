Description: 
	Remígio van Eys Chilaule, State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/L047-State_of_OSM_in_Mozambique__community_presentation_and_on-going_projects/

► Mapping of historic heritage sites – project presentation: mapping buildings and sites with historic importance for Mozambique. Reflecting on the challenge of tagging historical objects in OSM.

► Mapping of public transport in African cities, the case of Maputo – project presentation: mapping informal public transport. Reflecting on the usefulness of open data for better public transport management in large and highly informal cities.

► #MapeandoMeuBairro – community presentation: presenting different projects done by a new OSM community, likely the first based in Mozambique. All projects use mapping methodology that combines field with desk mapping; skilled mappers with local resident knowledge. Focus on contributing for development in low-income neighbourhoods hence the community name #MapeandoMeuBairro.

and I good morning I'm here to present

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:16,109
quickly present our Mozambican osm

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:19,410
community how do I so I'll just quickly

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,230
say we are my P&O mobile that's our name

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,480
with the hashtag and main ongoing

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,840
projects how we how we go about our

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,460
mapping and some of the main challenges

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,199
we are pretty much trying to become a

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,410
social movement in Mozambique that is

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,690
using community mapping to change the

00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:39,930
local urban urban settlements and

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,700
informally urban settlements using using

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,420
mapping as a means of requalification

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,190
and social well-being the name of the

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,350
communities hashtag Nepean de Mobile

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:54,480
which means mapping my neighborhood in

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,660
neighbourhood stands the part for the

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,579
neighborhood stands is Stanford for

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,969
these kinds of environments we try to

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,619
focus our work on the on the logo on the

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:09,229
on the outskirts of the main city center

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:12,990
usually associated with low-income

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:16,430
residents and poverty and crime and

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,689
other other negative negative

00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,000
associations often made about these

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:25,040
places and I'm sure they're they're

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,290
accurate but they're also quite positive

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,290
positive characteristics in these

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,420
neighborhoods and you can see ladies

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,420
caring for the elderly caring for the

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,110
kids in the street and a lot of

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:45,750
community involvement and togetherness

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:49,320
and solidarity improvised public space

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:54,990
even in low in low infrastructure

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:58,560
conditions and spaces where also the

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,840
elderly can can sit around and play so

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,119
it's a it's often not associated with

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,759
those kinds of environments are often

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,160
not associated with slums but they are

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,560
also important so we try to map

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,540
everything the the good and the bad

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,550
the good and the bad because often these

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,550
these kinds of events aren't aren't on

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,800
any Maps as you can see on the left on

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,050
the left the the map of the government

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,800
and on the right a more recent map we we

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:30,690
try to produce with our work we

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:35,110
collected a lot of buildings streets

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:37,540
drainage ways trees and much more we say

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,980
my my neighborhood because we try to not

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,450
come from the outside of these

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,840
neighborhoods and map instead we try to

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:46,060
train the local people in mapping and so

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,780
that they can hopefully when they become

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,300
autonomous and continue mapping their

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,970
their neighborhood and that's where the

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,130
hashtag comes in because the possibility

00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:02,140
given to us by OpenStreetMap and those

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:03,910
very low income resources help it is

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,070
what makes possible that these mapping

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:10,030
activities can go to to a slum

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:13,420
neighborhood quickly just some ongoing

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,300
projects we are we got a micro grant

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,010
from hot last year and so now this work

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,739
is continuing on the initiative of the

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,019
own of the people themselves they were

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:24,910
doing a questionnaire or a survey about

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:28,870
houses and they asked us to put this

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:30,640
survey on on the map as well out out of

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,470
their own initiative which is very

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,220
inspiring for us after the micro grant

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:40,180
ended to see the project still continue

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:43,239
even without any external funding and we

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,030
also are on going a bit slowly but we

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,030
are ongoing with putting the opens the

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,250
public transport on the map our public

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,280
transport and despite on the left being

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:59,019
it looks like a metro intricate Metro

00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,350
European City public transport it's only

00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:04,010
the little

00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,050
buses often overcrowded but we are we

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:10,580
are putting that on OpenStreetMap I'll

00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:14,180
jump a couple then we are doing with we

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:16,280
also received a micro grant from hot

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,600
this year so we plan to expand the work

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,410
we did in one of the neighborhoods to

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,630
map the drainage facilities in a bigger

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,790
area it is very much inspired by the

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:32,330
work being done in Tanzania by Raman

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:34,040
urea quickly just our our workflow what

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,800
we do we start with an opening community

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,110
forum in which we inform and invite the

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,230
residents to participate we invite

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,510
everybody or at least as much people as

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,510
we can reach and the selection processes

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:50,720
after informing everyone we train

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:54,020
everybody in OpenStreetMap and chose

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,090
them as you can see sometimes the

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,060
devices are a bit of a challenge but we

00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:01,220
try to overcome that and then we collect

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,050
field data again very inspired by the

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,380
Romani re-emitted ology combining

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:10,130
residents of the neighborhoods and the

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,780
university students and this is the kind

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,430
of environments we try to also put in

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,450
the map the little drainage that takes

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:19,100
water out of the house of the people to

00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,920
the main drainage the main drainage is

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,380
always already on the map but nobody

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:28,430
nobody has availability of data of how

00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:30,920
the the drainage or the water goes from

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,960
the houses outside out to the main drain

00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,120
so here you can see a student and the

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,140
resident combining and discussing how to

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,050
map this little infrastructure I'll jump

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:46,220
that we are also inspired by Romani we

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:49,820
are trying to implement low low low fine

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:53,540
low technology I mean keep drones to

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,280
make the mapping more accurate we don't

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,230
have a drone yet but that's our plan to

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,249
acquire one and then we do that

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:03,169
digitization on

00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:05,339
and we present the results at the end

00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:08,279
yeah there are some main challenges I'm

00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:10,649
running out of time so I'll jump a

00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:14,219
couple maybe say that one big challenge

00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:16,049
is the is the use of the data we feel we

00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:18,779
are mapping quite a lot in Mozambique

00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:21,869
and nobody still is I started using it

00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:24,269
no institutions with not some course but

00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:25,859
it isn't really getting much traction so

00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:27,449
far so we're putting a lot of data on

00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:31,109
OpenStreetMap about those neighborhoods

00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:34,249
but then nobody is using OpenStreetMap

00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:37,829
to use this data to make decisions and

00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:42,449
another small but maybe funnier

00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:45,869
challenge is the Western gear geared

00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:47,579
system of tagging people always ask us

00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:50,039
about so many churches in those

00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:53,489
neighborhoods and I understand that sure

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:56,069
that the church is a prominent part of

00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:58,949
the European city the big Cathedral

00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:01,079
while in in Maputo in mozambique the

00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:03,089
church can be in the in the backyard of

00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,789
someone's house and then you take that

00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:08,039
as a church and it renders on the map as

00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:11,819
something really prominent while it's

00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,339
it's very small again that happens with

00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,379
the little streets that I showed before

00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,769
these kinds of spaces you can't really

00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:22,289
call that a square like you would in in

00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:25,499
front of bromo but the tag is it's

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:27,959
probably exactly the same so sometimes

00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:31,319
it's funny to see how how this can be a

00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:34,469
highway we can tag this a highway a foot

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,119
way and then it doesn't really render a

00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:39,059
lot on the map but it's a very important

00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:40,589
part of these urban settlements like the

00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:43,079
little streets taking people to their

00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:44,789
homes so there's a bit of Western

00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,519
orientation of the tagging that

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:52,099
sometimes is hard to translate to to a

00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,099
slum environment thank you

00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:13,949
oh we have a question okay yeah just a

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,320
question it's not entirely relevant to

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,750
the mapping itself but I noticed that

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,270
you also met the drainage system and I'm

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,130
from the Netherlands and of course we

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,979
also have a lot of drainage systems

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:30,270
because we're below sea level but I

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:32,550
actually noticed that it looked pretty

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,289
well because often when you see these

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,180
kind of pictures of drainage systems in

00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,969
these slums then it's entirely filled

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,070
with letter and garbage and actually the

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:44,279
drainage is probably not functional

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,529
anymore and how is this situation in in

00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:51,860
these in these slums because it actually

00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:55,050
looked pretty nice it's the situation

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:58,380
it's not a real problem also in these

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,070
slums yeah it definitely is a problem in

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,320
most neighborhoods

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,600
luckily the neighborhood we we got we

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,330
worked on with a micro grant they have a

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,580
very active local NGO that does a lot of

00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,589
work with with clean cleaning the

00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,020
drainage and cleaning waste so the

00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:15,120
neighborhood is usually quite clean and

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,670
it's the same NGO that asked us to map

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,050
this work that they're already doing

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:22,200
while in the other neighborhoods without

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,120
this local active NGO it the situation

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,100
is a bit more similar thing to what we

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,250
know from other places to always

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,089
blockage and a lot of waste yeah okay

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,089
