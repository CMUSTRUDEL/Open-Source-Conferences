Looking back only a few years, it is amazing to witness the astonishing expansion of the global »geo-community«. Nowhere else has there been such an abundance of open source learning and teaching resources which have lowered the entry-barrier to the world of technology. The global Maptime movement has certainly played a fundamental role in this regard, with its contagious spirit of inclusion, a special dedication to beginners' involvement, and of course: rainbows. However, building lasting communities is far from a trivial task. While the spreading of Maptime chapters across the world is a testament to the value of openness and inclusiveness in creating educational curricula, organisers face regular challenges that greatly vary across geographies. Rather than being a celebration of the goals achieved so far, this talk will reflect on the challenges and lessons learned on the road to building open and inclusive (geo)communities in Milan, Italy and Berlin, Germany. Beginners very welcome!

hello can you hear me yeah great so yeah

00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,160

am so great that you still came out to

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,230
hear about our topic and today we're

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,000
going to be talking about nap time and

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,189
we're going to tell you a little tale

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,140
about nap time and a lot of people might

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,849
not actually know what map time is but

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,130
we'll get to that and but before we do

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,590
that before we do that that's just we

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,840
want to introduce ourselves so my name

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,110
is Alcee know I'm from Berlin I'm the

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,379
organizer and coordinator of map 10

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,750
Berlin I'm an interface designer I deal

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,360
a lot with data visualization Geographic

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,789
data this and I work mostly freelance

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,059
but sometimes also for data journalistic

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,850
projects currently outside online and hi

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,890
my name is Michaela I'm a spatial data

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,530
scientist and PhD candidate at King's

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,140
College London and I'm the founder and

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,540
former organizer of meta Milano

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,130
which has now been taken over by stefano

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,689
and alessandro thank you guys and before

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,369
we you know actually go into the details

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,430
we would like to just explain a little

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,409
bit what matt time actually is so map

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,150
time in itself is an open learning

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,390
environment it is actually a set of

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,530
regular meetups that take place in a lot

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,210
of different cities around the world

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,000
where people can actually learn about

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,189
maps and map making it's not restricted

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,470
to any type of technology or tools but

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,509
it's really like an open source and also

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,380
open community and it was founded by

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,119
Beth Schecter in San Francisco who was

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,860
at the time working at stamen design

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,710
which some of you might probably know

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,990
and if you're interested to hear more

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,270
about the general history of map time

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,880
you can go log onto the side and map

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:58,110
time dot IO and have a look at it and

00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:01,170
yeah find out more so what makes map

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,909
time so special you know comes with

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,850
regards to other meetups maybe and other

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,039
geo groups so first of all it's really a

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,429
geared towards beginners so it's really

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,019
about learning about how to make Maps

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:17,000
you know it could be a wet map it could

00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:19,640
also be GIS tools anything really and we

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,200
really try to keep it as as well the

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,000
barrier to entry as low as possible so

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,340
we really tried you know and someone

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,510
doesn't need to be able to code or be a

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,819
programmer or have any technical

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,530
background to come so it's really that's

00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,810
really the spirit and also we try to be

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,879
you know I have playful projects we show

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,010
stuff we do tutorials which come in

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,200
handy but yeah which are not necessarily

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,290
technical and we also try to be very

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,790
welcoming like our speakers because from

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,019
yesterday from Belgium from the OSM

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,849
community was saying they were really

00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,159
trying to be welcoming and I think we're

00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:50,750
trying to be the same and and emphasize

00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,269
this and not exclude anyone here plus

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:57,019
we're really funky fresh that is of

00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:58,489
course true this is what a typical map

00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:59,959
temp session could look like so a lot of

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,389
people in a room with a lot of laptops

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,359
and then Sebastian actually who's

00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:08,030
already also there he's this particular

00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,959
session he was giving a tutorial and

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,230
then we're sitting there discussing

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,159
having tutorials having showing projects

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,730
and so forth and learning together

00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,379
that's the most important part map tom

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,180
has evolved quite a lot actually over

00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:22,970
the recent years so now we have 120

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,530
chapters worldwide of which of course

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,989
not all of them are really active but

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,780
you know you have quite a few and mostly

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:32,810
in the US and some in Europe and then

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,430
all over some other places as well and

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,349
there's a lot of creativity also going

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,269
on so know for example here you see some

00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:40,190
some of the different logos that people

00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:41,870
have come up with it's you know it's not

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,129
a not a centralized organization where

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,099
there's only one logo and then people

00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:47,329
have to follow something but it's rather

00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:50,209
yeah a location-specific

00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:52,669
and people can you know be crazy and do

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,970
whatever type of logo they want so yeah

00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:57,049
that's a lot of creativity there and I'm

00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,400
just going to give you you know the

00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:59,989
first part of the story so I'm going to

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,780
tell you this the tale about a map time

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:05,569
Berlin and how it all started so

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,599
basically it started all with me because

00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,489
I kind of wanted to to found this and at

00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,949
that point you know back a few years

00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,680
back I was really interested in doing

00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:18,079
data visualization and maps and web maps

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,519
and I want to be you know I was thinking

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,350
okay what's the most basic thing I can

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,480
do and I saw web maps and but I wasn't

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,310
to do to do web mapping I didn't even

00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,630
know how to put a pin on on like a

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,280
marker on the map and I was like okay

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,620
that that really it's really bothering

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,530
me I mean that can't be that hard but I

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,830
really couldn't do it so that was a bit

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,030
of a bummer and after at that point I

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,410
was looking a lot I was also joining

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,560
Twitter that was like when I first

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,930
discovered it and I saw all these great

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,240
learning resources on Twitter about from

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,370
map time especially about what a web map

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,790
is how it works what are tiles what is

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,590
what is a tile renderer what is a web

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,300
map what a data layers what is geo J's

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,780
and all these things that you know are

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,850
pretty inaccessible usually and I went

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,290
to the u.s. met met Beth and some of the

00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,720
people at stamen and they really

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,000
convinced me to do it like open up my

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,140
own chapter in Berlin and at the

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,580
beginning I was really afraid because I

00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,530
didn't know anything about all these

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,010
technologies I was like okay I'll just

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,900
give it a shot so I came back to Berlin

00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,430
and the first thing I did was to look

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,380
for people who actually knew something

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,700
about it about this topic so I wasn't

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,130
really it wouldn't get lost in all this

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:28,070
so I found Sebastian and some two other

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,840
guys here and we just decided at some

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,270
point okay we're gonna have this meetup

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,070
a wet the page and we were just gonna

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,510
set a date and see what happens and see

00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,180
if anyone's interested to learn about

00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,440
maps or whether it's just ask then at

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,930
least would be a three of us that's fine

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,400
too but um it turned out that actually

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,410
some of people some people came so here

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,320
this is the first session we had about

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,460
20 people and yeah people were really

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,530
interested and that's actually on the

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,420
top that's me with my hand raised like

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,160
this and trying talking something about

00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,020
maps which of course at that point I

00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
didn't know what I was talking about but

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,130
I think I think not a lot of people

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,590
actually realize that so or maybe they

00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,640
were just too polite to to say it but

00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,110
they came back and that was really good

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,610
so then we started to kind of grow the

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,940
community people more and more people

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,830
came we had a really regular schedule so

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,630
every month like we had a we had a

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,250
session and we started to think about

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,440
what other topics could we do not only

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,610
web mapping but also maybe you know

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,190
topics where people would just talk

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,610
about maps and this one was for example

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,590
one on hand-drawn maps and imaginary

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,689
maps so how people would actually deal

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,029
with physical space around weather

00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:36,589
live and how they could you know come up

00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,879
with their own personal mind mats let's

00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:39,979
say and and that was also really

00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,869
interesting and and we had really great

00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:43,459
discussions about Berlin specifics parts

00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:47,599
of the city and neighborhoods especially

00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:49,309
so that was also different then we also

00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,289
invited people from for example like

00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:53,479
this this is a slide some of the guests

00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:55,279
from from Spiegel Online a German a big

00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,379
German newspaper and they talked about

00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,329
data journalism because in Germany maps

00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:00,499
and digital maps especially go hand in

00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:02,839
hand a lot with the data journalism

00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:05,749
community it's kind of intertwined I

00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:09,050
guess so we also had a lot of people

00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:11,059
from this area coming and we also

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,039
managed to actually go to with a map

00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:14,509
with a group of map timers in Berlin to

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,149
the to the vault

00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:19,699
to the secret and map vault in in the in

00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:21,439
the library so they invited us to go

00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:22,729
there and see some of the old maps that

00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,219
usually you won't really get access to

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:26,959
but we were lucky because we're map time

00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:29,239
Berlin and they said okay you can come

00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,839
and have a look so that was also really

00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:35,899
cool and yeah it evolved you know over

00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,119
time this is just a bit of a graph of

00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:40,759
how how the the membership in our meetup

00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:42,229
page has evolved and apparently yeah

00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,969
people are still interested people you

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,759
know since the start have have actually

00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:49,399
joined and yeah now we're at I think a

00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,039
1400 people you know in meetup group and

00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,229
regular 70 70 to 75 people may be

00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,929
showing up for every a meetup so

00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:59,029
sometimes we even have to kind of limit

00:07:56,929 --> 00:08:01,429
limit the events because our venue is

00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:04,039
not as big but we're of course we're

00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:06,949
really happy that everyone's there and

00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,239
that people are still interested and but

00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,699
you know with a bigger community of

00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:12,110
course you have a lot of a lot of stuff

00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,509
happening and of course this means more

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,999
pain in a way for our for our SS

00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:19,099
organizers so of course you need more

00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:21,110
space you know for example to put in a

00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:23,779
Christmas tree into the venue you need

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,610
that of course you need more money to

00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:26,809
buy you know pizza people want to drink

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,860
something some people only come for the

00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:32,180
pizza of course so that's also cool and

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,219
also to run errands and and all that

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:38,329
kind of stuff so yeah that means money

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:39,319
and also you need more time and also you

00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:40,969
need to keep everyone pleased right

00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,809
because more people come they are really

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:43,919
different they come from different

00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,990
communities and they're like okay I want

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,990
in post GIS and were like ah maybe

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,010
that's not not a topic for beginners so

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,779
maybe we start with a web map which

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,990
maybe we start with leaflet and let's

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,250
see so you can't keep everyone happy so

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,320
in order to deal with these challenges

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,180
we kind of just started okay let's just

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,709
experiment a bit and and we don't know

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,550
how this works we've never done this

00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,130
before

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,350
that's just yeah they do our best and

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,790
see what happens

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,459
so in terms of the space thing we were

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,260
really lucky to find a sponsor which was

00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,360
local in Berlin and who were really

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,630
interested to to host us and have us do

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,829
the meetups there and local sponsor from

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,440
our side I think it's really really

00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:24,240
helpful because yeah they're usually

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,829
interested in what you do and they don't

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,940
just do it for the marketing because

00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:28,920
some some you know if it's a big

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,170
corporation from somewhere else they

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,820
might actually just do it - you know

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,860
tweet about it but so if they're really

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,250
interested for the for the sake of what

00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,399
you do that's usually better in terms of

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,630
the money thing we we found also we

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,300
found sponsors we had quite a few

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,620
different sponsors and what we really

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,390
found out what really works well it's

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,890
small companies because big companies as

00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,690
I said before they tend to use that for

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,720
marketing and also it takes a lot longer

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,589
to get money so we had a really big

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,709
geospatial company at the beginning

00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:00,089
which name I won't mention now but for

00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:02,339
them it took it it took like five months

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:04,920
to get a thousand euros budget for half

00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:07,290
a year and a lot of paperwork so that

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,930
was a bit bit too much so now we have a

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,040
smaller sponsor which works way better

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,170
and for the time

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,220
issue I guess yeah you need some people

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,870
to help you out you can't do it by

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,399
yourself you can't really organize a

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,320
group like that by yourself you need

00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,180
some people split up the work and also

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,140
to take a step back once you feel that

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:27,060
it's getting a bit too much and you know

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,890
the thing is I mean what you want to do

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,839
is really you want to keep it keep it

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,850
fresh right so you want to really

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,680
usually what happens to a community like

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,970
this you have a at the beginning you're

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,410
really excited you have a lot of ideas

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,690
and it's like yeah really cool we're

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,100
going to do this this this at some point

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,750
you reach a point where it's actually

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,790
you've done all this you know you have a

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,949
lot of topics covered you've invited a

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,720
lot of speakers and maybe also other

00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:51,870
things in your life then just organizing

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,290
a group and at this point you can either

00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,029
just say okay well we just keep on go go

00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,310
keep on going and get bored and then

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:01,740
just abandon at some point or you can

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,420
say okay let's maybe change change some

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,639
stuff and get some more people to be on

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:09,000
board and maybe take a step back from

00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,740
what you've been doing and in terms of

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,870
keeping everyone pleased our solution is

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,310
really to to was really to be aware of

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,100
the mission so we really said okay we

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,790
want to have a beginner focus and that's

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,519
what we want

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,529
and also that means that we have to find

00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,079
a good balance of content so for example

00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,579
some people would maybe were interested

00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,139
in learning something technical but some

00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,519
people who came for the first time from

00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,009
an architectural point of view would not

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,690
really understand what that means

00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:35,579
so then you know we try to mix this up

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,440
with content that would be maybe more

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,350
artistic but was still related to

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,420
mapping for example like this is Daniel

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,720
Belasco Rogers an artist from Berlin and

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,759
he just showed us his way of mapping his

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,670
daily daily surroundings and that was

00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,050
also really interesting for other people

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,310
but I've also you know not only had

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,170
great content but I've also met great

00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:58,470
people through map time for example

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,269
Michaela here I met him through a map

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,190
time because he wrote me at some point a

00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:03,810
message on swag that he was in Berlin

00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,269
and that he had just found it mapped a

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,490
Milano and well you can tell him more

00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:10,920
about that now

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,260
thank you see and so yeah in the second

00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,720
part I'm gonna go through the events

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:19,019
that happened between 2014 and 2016 when

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,440
I was running a chapter but my story

00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:24,360
actually starts a few years before

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,149
precisely in Milan in this neighborhood

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,620
in exactly in this square as a matter of

00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:30,180
fact if you just cross the square and

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,579
you're on the other side you can find

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,709
this nice marble fountain with some

00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:36,600
really slick benches where I used to

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:38,550
ruin my knees skateboarding when I was a

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,829
teenager and incidentally they also

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,790
became my first osm aid it's a few years

00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:46,139
later and if you skip a few later again

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,550
Politecnico became my home as a student

00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:52,439
so it's a pleasure for me to be here

00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:54,060
with you today so at the time I was

00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,069
really into you know the hard kappa

00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:59,009
graphic sciences like remote sensing and

00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:00,779
GIS and spatial analysis and this was

00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:03,899
pretty much the extent of the cata

00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:06,209
graphic knowledge that I knew so you can

00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,010
imagine my surprise when I encounter map

00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:12,820
time online with this explosion of

00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:15,220
course and rainbows and I was really

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,170
blown away but more so than the colors

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,540
by the fact that map time is such an

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,270
inclusive and supportive community so in

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,360
the summer of 2014 I attended foss4g in

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,860
Portland I met Lizzie and Rafa and when

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,800
I came back I was just super excited to

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,990
start this is a picture that took a year

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,760
after and it's you know just stickers

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,860
from the map time headquarters but again

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,420
I think it's a testament to this feeling

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,210
of support that you get like you're not

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,400
alone in running these so it was really

00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,800
excited it was September and I decided

00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,720
yeah let's do it back then I was I was

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,540
working at Polytechnic as a GIS analyst

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,160
u.s. developer and together with a with

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,020
a lecturer here actually across the

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,630
square this time in the architecture

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,070
faculty we had our first response event

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,870
it was exciting

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,360
I think this silly gif is again a

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,910
testimony to that sense of excitement

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,610
and but it was also I was also

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:12,370
personally really scared

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,170
I remember just before and just before

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,640
the Meetup you know trying to derive in

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,430
Mercator projection mathematically

00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,930
because I thought I need to do you know

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,910
I need to understand all the things it

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,670
was my duty as an organizer to have

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,770
everything under control and this

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,600
feeling really didn't left me even when

00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,490
we moved away from Polytechnic on to the

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,880
open dot Fab Lab the other location that

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,950
hosted us so far I received an email I

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,350
apologize it's in Italian but it roughly

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,210
translates through huh so your organize

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,770
a meet-up about maps and you cannot even

00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,810
put the address correctly you cannot

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,650
even put a pin on the map and I thought

00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,050
oh man

00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,490
I'm such a terrible organizer it's it's

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:52,960
shameful by the way the address was

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:55,630
there so so this proves my my first

00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,100
point which is kinda you know it's okay

00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,200
to be an amateur you don't need to be

00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,120
you know 100% professional to make

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,380
things polished all the time when you're

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,950
doing like something for the community

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:08,170
so it's okay to be an amateur anyway

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,510
after that first time we collected some

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,190
ideas from the community we let them

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,310
write some post-its with you know their

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,260
interest as you might imagine we got all

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,330
kinds of answers people wanted to learn

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,930
a proprietary software which I'm not

00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,149
gonna mention

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,700
they also wanted to learn the equivalent

00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:26,890
open-source version they wanted to learn

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,270
something really specific and at the

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,660
same time they wanted to learn

00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,860
everything and I mean this is really

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,779
challenging from an organizer

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,279
perspective because you're confronted

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:38,230
with such a wide spectrum of

00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,990
expectations and you know it's it's hard

00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,390
to cope with so I think a way to go

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,220
around this is to really listen to your

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:48,190
community and to kind of try to

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,010
understand who who's in front of you so

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:53,170
to do that I thought well you know we're

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,149
in Milan and he's put on this light some

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,730
items that characterize Milan like a

00:15:55,149 --> 00:16:00,370
beautiful Duomo the saffron resort on

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:03,730
the aperitivo but that's one item that's

00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,529
missing here who can tell me what item

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:11,380
characterizes Milan what makes me not

00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:13,180
famous in the world anybody exactly I

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,850
mean you might have seen from a fancy

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,399
outfit but I mean it's a bit of a

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:21,310
stretch but it's true that million hosts

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,200
the largest creative sector in Italy so

00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,810
we had lots of people come in you know

00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,820
from from design from architecture we

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,580
also again like data journalists and

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,320
people work in later visualization so to

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,959
kinda castle to their interest and to

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,720
let the community grow that some meetups

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,850
about the tree and some meetups about

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,500
you know cultural heritage and public

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,110
spaces and they're really good because

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,260
we've got to invite speakers and and

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,610
extend our network at the same time and

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,040
there were a bit challenging for of

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,450
anubis for for beginners because you

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,339
know if you're not part of those sub

00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:58,000
communities it's hard to follow these

00:16:54,339 --> 00:17:00,209
technical topics eventually though I

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,770
became a bit tired of just you know

00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:04,360
adapting content that was provided for

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,850
me so basically translating from English

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,650
to Italian tutorials that I found online

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:11,740
and I wanted to do something of my own

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,900
and I thought hang on we are in a Fab

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,550
Lab and for those of you who don't know

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,350
what a Fab Lab is it's like a community

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,910
workshop when you can use digital

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,699
fabrication technologies like 3d

00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:24,429
printing and Arduino and CNC machines

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,839
and so we started using that space this

00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:27,520
is just a silly example of something

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,190
that we did it's an entire interactive

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,080
3d map of Italy

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,570
but as soon as it is it was really

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,540
useful we presented it at the Italian

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,520
Open Street Map gathering in 2016 which

00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,980
allowed us to meet other communities

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,780
such as Wikipedians wikimedia Italy in

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:48,340
the Wikipedians and to can overlap with

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:50,920
them and and this goes to my other point

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,890
which i think it's very important map

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,360
time there is a cross geography and a

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,250
chapter in the US is not the same as a

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,020
chapter in Europe and Berlin is not mean

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,820
and vice-versa so you really need to

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,950
relate to your local content play your

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,600
angle and you understand what you what

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,710
you have in your local dimension which

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:11,380
in our case was this Fablab despite of

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,660
this effort things don't always go you

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,490
know a smooth you wish you can see this

00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,620
is just a snapshot of the attendees

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,140
number and you can see that some months

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,540
we had few people come in and then you

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,830
know the month before we month pretty

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,780
much nobody came but then the numbers

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,480
went up again the following and they

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:30,540
just keep rocking back and forth and and

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,230
this goes to my last point which is

00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,150
communities are really hard to

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,100
understand they're really delicate that

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,440
so you know easy to disrupt and fragile

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,360
but a wonderful things and when they

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,250
work they're just amazing like I mean

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,240
these paces - you know for mutual

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:49,330
exchange for growing together so just to

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,640
sum up a few few points for me like a

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,590
takeaway point would be don't be afraid

00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,000
to jump into something new don't be

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,700
afraid that you know you don't know

00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,730
enough it's gonna be ok eventually

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,250
hopefully and I find that doing

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,440
something practical really helps so I

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:08,470
strived for doing tutorials that were

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,270
always practical so that you know not

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,340
India will go home the following day and

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,980
think yeah maybe there was a bit chaotic

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,720
not so polished but you know I learned

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,870
this I learned a skill and I can apply

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,600
it in my job or you know from now

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,030
onwards I think it really helped me and

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,620
the last two parts I mean first it was

00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,990
also always this thing where we were

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,100
really unsure whether people would be

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,050
able to understand that whether people

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,430
would like it and I think this having a

00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,770
clear mission really helped us in that

00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,930
sense of making sure what we actually

00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,340
wanted to do and also yeah I take a

00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,840
chance to disappoint at some point you

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,850
know some things don't work out

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,350
sometimes we didn't have internet some

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,720
some talks were all

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:49,179
some talks were great but well it goes

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,470
that way and that's fine so I would

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:52,389
encourage you to go out found your

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,129
mapped and chapter in the somewhere in

00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:55,990
the world if there's not none if there's

00:19:54,129 --> 00:20:00,310
already one please go and join it and

00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:05,870
have fun and make maps yeah thanks

00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:10,200
[Applause]

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:11,490
if someone have some question before the

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,300
question can we just say make an

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:17,130
announcement so you know I don't have

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,650
plans tonight please join us I'm gonna

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,300
be partying with poly markers at

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,580
beautiful ombre which is the local

00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:27,270
brewery it's just two minutes by a feet

00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,980
and following the railway tracks so yeah

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,450
it's basically there so you go out in

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,390
the square to the left hand and to the

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,600
right and follow the tram line please

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,600
join us

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,090
yep

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,680
please take pictures and tweet it and

00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:52,380
whatever yeah

00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:55,650
print posters thanks that was great I

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,930
must admit I hadn't heard of map time

00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:01,680
until I saw it in the program and I

00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:07,410
wondered if you do it collaborate at all

00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:08,670
with missing maps groups we've in Berlin

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,010
we've been in touch with missing maps

00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,360
and also with the hot osm and so forth

00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,310
so the communities are definitely

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,110
intertwined also the OSM community is

00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,360
part of the maptime community if you

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,830
will but they're still separate groups

00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,480
so there I would say there's overlap but

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,040
we're not like we in Berlin we haven't

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,330
done like a specific event together even

00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,620
though it was planned but there's been

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,320
so many things that we planned that

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,160
haven't turned out to to be realized but

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,630
yeah there is definitely contact and

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,990
that's actually how I met beat pit

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,580
masters yes we does I would say yeah

00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:41,940
they're not the same community but as a

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,320
lot of relevant and running marathons

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,760
for missing maps is actually like a

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,760
really cool map time activity

00:21:49,210 --> 00:22:06,110
good question okay okay what what is

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:10,220
that have you guys thought of getting

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:13,880
new leaders into running these meetups

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,280
in a more sustainable consistent way or

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,340
that's the responsibility fall on the

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,200
same person all the time yeah that's a

00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,520
good question because we have we've just

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,340
gone through this process in Berlin

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,310
actually because Sebastian and me were

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:30,140
both pretty yeah like worked out with

00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,760
other stuff so one more more stuff

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,620
happening you know person in our other

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,420
lives professional lives private life so

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,340
we didn't have as much time anymore so

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,540
what we did yeah we actually we we have

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,270
two more people come up on the

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,650
organizing team because otherwise I mean

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,780
we also felt at some point that we'd

00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,160
already kind of used all our contacts so

00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,870
we invited all the people that we

00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,300
thought were cool and that could do good

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,800
stuff and at some point it's really like

00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,690
you're kind of doing repetitive things

00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,850
and it just it doesn't it's not as much

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,650
fun anymore so yeah we try to get new

00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,450
people to join us also coming from other

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,820
areas and not the same bubbles that we

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,470
were in maybe so yeah we've done that

00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,760
we've we're now bigger which is also

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,320
good challenging because at the same

00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,670
time once you're bigger than you then

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,380
you don't have to send emails to three

00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,880
people but five or six then the

00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,940
responses come in and then you're like

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,100
oh man all these emails so that's also

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,050
be challenging but yeah I would

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:21,290
definitely recommend to have like always

00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,640
you know keep keep on to getting new

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,500
people on board because otherwise it

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,580
will just not be sustainable over the

00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,530
long in the long run I relocated to

00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:34,820
London for my studies so it wasn't like

00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:36,950
I was forced to but it was always nice

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,990
to find new people anyway jumping in and

00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,860
bringing fresh energies and new

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,860
perspective on things

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,490
okay so if there are no other question

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,490
