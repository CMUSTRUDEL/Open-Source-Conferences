Title: 2019: Notes:  Can we do better. Experiences and Ideas from the Frontline.
Publication date: 2019-09-28

Description: 
	An analysis of Notes, based on local experience of managing notes.

Over 1 735 319 notes have been added to OSM, currently 416 224 notes are still open. 

Even looking at a small area such as Edinburgh, the city I live in, we have around 10 new notes added every day.  

It's interesting to note the motivation of people adding notes, many are added by regular experienced mappers for changes that need to happen in the future, some are added by local businesses or anonymous users altering us to problems on the map and some by non technical users for changes that are required.

These note  encapsulate a few different categories:
Things that can be fixed quickly and the note closed straightaway.

We then have short to medium term notes, such as shops closing or road closures that may be for issues for between days and months. 

Then finally then some of the very long term items, such as the construction of the Forth Crossing, New Hospitals or Housing Estates that may be tracking developments for years.

But with so many notes remaining open, issues can very easily be missed.

I will briefly review some of the tools available for tracking notes, and talk about how we deal with notes including some of our local tests with using github issues to track some of the longer term issues.

Finally  as well as hopefully look at some ways of managing notes. Hopefully with some prototypes for ways that  notes might be improved either directly on the OSM site or via an external site.

cheers thanks for having me I thought I

00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,119
did a talk on OpenStreetMap notes it's

00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,190
something that certainly I've been kind

00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,480
of using more and more often as a way of

00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,760
getting feedback and I'll talk a little

00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,849
bit about why and how we use notes

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,560
locally in our community and some of the

00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:29,679
issues and problems that we come come

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,210
across and maybe some ideas of how notes

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,740
could be improved and used differently

00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,480
in the future or things just kind of

00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,660
start with the brief history of notes of

00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,719
what our notes originally there was

00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,609
around 2009 the OpenStreetMap wiki isn't

00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:49,390
very specific on it there was a separate

00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:51,579
site called OpenStreetMap bugs and that

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:55,239
provided a very simple way of recording

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:56,829
issues in April 2013 the notes

00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,489
functionality was added into the

00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:03,129
OpenStreetMap website around May 2014

00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:04,720
all the bugs have been imported and it

00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,120
was transferred over so this is what the

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,430
old hope it's doing that bugs website

00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,260
looked like and then it was added in toe

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,420
for Street map and actually what's great

00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,460
about it is it's once you know it's

00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,730
there it's relatively accessible it's

00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,770
very easy to add a note anybody can do

00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,930
it you put your notes on you got some

00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:28,780
text I think we've all probably seen and

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:31,660
done it very easy to create and so makes

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,660
notes very easy to contribute we have a

00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,370
regular note contributor and kind of he

00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,050
started by leaving anonymous notes and

00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,580
we're like kind of would be helpful if

00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,780
you created an account so you created an

00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,730
account so we need who they were coming

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,930
from that was great we kind of suggested

00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,240
that maybe he could make me edits

00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,160
himself they were just shops opening and

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,690
closing and we got a message back from

00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,300
one of the notes saying I've tried I

00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,950
just can't work it out but his bait is

00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,110
very valuable so it's great that we've

00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,870
got someone who who finds it hard to use

00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,940
ID to add notes but he can still

00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,860
actually provide his knowledge so we're

00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,540
very happy with that and actually notes

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,780
are highly visible in a way that they

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:13,810
aren't always I've got an example here

00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:16,659
of an issue and in this case there was a

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,280
fixed me added to the website but it's

00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:18,970
actually hidden away in the node

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,980
actually

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,530
she's looking at the node you wouldn't

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,000
know that there's an issue there so that

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,500
has then been tending to make that we

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,150
actually do need to just go and visit it

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
and see because actually when you're

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,350
just going watch you don't need to look

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,880
at fix meas are great but you've got to

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,310
either look at another tool to see them

00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,110
or you've got a you've got to be editing

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,300
in that area and actually if you need to

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:46,060
go and visit somewhere to verify it it's

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:47,500
kind of hard to how to use something

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,570
that's quite important to have have the

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,540
ability to have notes and be able to do

00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,830
that so I kind of just started looking

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,480
at mates I thought was interesting to

00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,670
have a look at some of the numbers on

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,590
them so the orange line which is the

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,170
line at the top is the number of notes

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,980
opened over time and the purple line

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:08,440
underneath is the number of notes closed

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,180
the main points there is that I think we

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,950
can see that there's pretty much always

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,350
been more notes open than closed there's

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,940
only one exception to that which is in

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,310
May this year I think that was probably

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,510
was an f5

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,620
it's actually closed note so there was a

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,390
there was a nice peak and no pages then

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,640
I've not investigated it but there was a

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:31,510
big increase in notes being opened in

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,340
May 2016 my I'm pretty sure that was

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,019
when map stopped me added the ability to

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,760
start someone's nodding that's good I

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:38,620
was going to try and find it in the

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,970
notes so we've got this massive peak

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,070
it's kind of interesting when you see it

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,660
that was a big increase and then

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,060
actually they probably improved the

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,590
interface in August that probably sounds

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,570
about right and the number of notes kind

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,120
of it's actually been relatively stable

00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:56,620
stable since then but we are talking

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,799
about about 40,000 notes going into

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,810
OpenStreetMap and I think it's on a a

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,959
month that's a monthly basis every month

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,830
there's 40,000 notes going in and

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,940
Unicode last month about 36,000 native

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,440
been closed and that that's what

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:16,150
required that seems about typical I

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,519
think yeah so in total when you look

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,650
across the database as 1.4 million notes

00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,300
have been closed and there's about four

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,310
hundred and thirty thousand notes that

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,900
are still open those numbers will have

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,949
changed because that data's a week old

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,930
but

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,879
I hope you'll forgive me I was kind of

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,530
interested as well in the how quickly

00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:37,029
notes were closed so I try to draw a

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:39,909
graph so the one axis is the number of

00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:43,300
notes that so that the x-axis is the

00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:44,499
time to close a note and the y-axis is

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,939
the number of notes I'm actually there's

00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:51,039
a lot of notes phase right at the

00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:52,870
beginning and then a very long tail so

00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,580
then kind of dug in further 12th a

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,110
caveat is I was only looking at notes

00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,180
that are closed so these stats they

00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,460
include notes that are still open but

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,930
actually all the close notes

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,370
twenty-seven and a half percent are

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,810
actually closed the fight with him one

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,279
day which i think is pretty pretty

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,849
impressive actually I was higher than I

00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:14,759
I would have expected 50% within 14 days

00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:17,889
and 57% within 30 days unfortunately

00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:21,569
then the it slows right down so to get

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:23,680
the 90% of notes it's 430 days by I

00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:25,659
think that's probably our issues there

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,229
but actually some of that is also to be

00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,229
expected

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,759
certainly my workflow for notes is using

00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:38,620
RSS feed so I have a feed of all the

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,969
notes in a big chunk of Scotland divided

00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,800
into separate things so this is a feed

00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:43,389
of notes in Edinburgh

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm actually most mornings I love a

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:47,919
quick go through that and actually try

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,909
and try and see what see see what needs

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,899
licking ass so as I say I'm in Edinburgh

00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,939
and I was just going to give you an

00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:56,680
example of the kind of kind of area that

00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:59,199
we map in because I think it's

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,210
interesting we're we've moved from a

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,129
city that was needing a lot of mapping

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,710
to the point where we've actually now

00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,810
got a lot of detail and I think that's

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,849
one of the reasons maybe that the the

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,139
user the leaves a lot of the notes finds

00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:13,569
it hard because actually within all the

00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:16,779
detail actually trying to find what you

00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:19,029
want to change it's maybe hard as you

00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:21,159
can see we've got buildings we've got

00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:23,620
private gardens mapped we've got trees

00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:24,969
mapped we've got all the shops mapped

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,250
that we also kind of came up with a

00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:29,050
problem which is that within the

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,370
tenement buildings you'll have a shop

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,229
entrance actually maybe there were two

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,629
shops in there and you'd have a store

00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,129
two stairwell which was residential so

00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,900
we actually have when we map we map

00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:40,300
every address

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,310
and then all the shops are as point

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,980
nodes within behind that so you've kind

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,580
of got this quite complicated structure

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:50,440
it's worth just having a look at and

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,680
what that looks like if I go in you can

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,330
see this party notes around there this

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,920
one I wanted to look at before I came to

00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,440
save the map which is the kind of

00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,550
typical there's an empty unit but

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,210
there's a sign saying something's

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,230
happening

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:07,480
EDI in 1979 there there are kind of main

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,100
source of new information but we also

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,200
have a note for a school that had closed

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,540
there's now a building site so we've got

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,090
that we've got a note here where I'm

00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,140
kind of someone said I knew this as this

00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,260
name and then there's a bit of a

00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,700
discussion on how to tag that and kind

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,250
of drop the drop the ball on that one

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,680
because we we need to make a decision on

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,360
how best to tag it and then there's a

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,580
restaurant where we've got a link to the

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,280
planning permission so that's a kind of

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,080
typical kind of kind of way that we tend

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,350
to work I've got some more examples in a

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,270
moment as I say there's kind of a

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,480
capturing of notes that kind of you can

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,490
immediately act on here's one there

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,570
which as I said earlier there's Charlie

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,760
shoppers clothes

00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,470
they hope it should be open elsewhere

00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:55,360
but we can close that shop and we can

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:57,580
close that note for now there's there's

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,220
kind of notes that you need to act on

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,230
now well you could act on now but they

00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,050
probably need a survey and an example of

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,520
this as there's a discussion someone

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,310
changed the name of a streets and we

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,330
kind of queried it and they went

00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,700
possibly they're saying it's not a

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,560
streets may be a clue that they weren't

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,530
quite actually they did the reply so you

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,200
kind of we assume good faith and they

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,520
kind of insisted they were correct so

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,820
finally I had a chance to go and visit

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,800
it this is the bike ride I did the

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,300
actual point we were visiting was there

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,370
so maybe it wasn't only a visit to visit

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,290
to go and do the note but it was useful

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:40,390
to do on the way say oh cops to the no

00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:41,920
point there was the street sign which

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,630
was actually what it was originally so

00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,450
the change he'd made wasn't correct

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,480
so we were then able to create the sign

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,089
correct

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,940
close the note it's an interesting case

00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:55,310
where the marker wasn't adding childish

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,529
they were censoring the map for for

00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,529
whatever reason maybe you know who knows

00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:03,620
but it was great we got to close it and

00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:04,670
that was that was that was done and then

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,839
there's there's a kind of another

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,639
catcher who have notice and they get

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,310
harder and harder to solve these are

00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:12,260
things that are happening soon and I can

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,240
stop looking out for these when I was

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,399
preparing for the talk

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,680
so one of those categories was was a

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,110
note that went on the map back in June

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,060
and as laughs this place is closing to

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,190
see and quite often with these I'll go

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,019
and have a search from social media see

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,910
if I can find it and sure enough there

00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:30,860
on the Facebook page some good

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,350
confirmation that they were closing but

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,540
there wasn't a date say I left it and

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,870
then when I started writing the talk in

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,750
September I suddenly realized all what's

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,250
happened to that so found the page

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,329
unfortunately it closed in June and

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,649
renowned September Bay it was there say

00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,820
there's a problem there because I saw

00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:52,279
the note appear

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,339
I checked the note I can act on the name

00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,310
then and then kind of missed the actual

00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:01,040
closing of the of the place but there

00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,899
was the note went in and it's the thing

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,110
set the tag so old name and just use

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:08,209
shop boom there's the mate so that's

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,100
that was now dealt with this is also the

00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:10,760
danger of writing this talk every time I

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,709
find notes

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,029
I keep kind of getting distracted to go

00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:16,279
and solve them and investigate them

00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:18,560
means writing it takes much longer than

00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,690
it should but you've got kind of got

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:25,339
those ones and then you've got long-term

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:28,579
projects that probably the classic one

00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:30,769
is when there's new developments so we

00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:34,610
have a note added for a new housing

00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:36,050
development and one of the guys Donald

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,639
added it and there was unresolved notes

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,260
and housing construction with work I'm

00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,589
going here could do with a survey since

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,300
that was two years ago and then classic

00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:45,110
anonymous nodes they been they'd

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,120
surveyed

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,310
rated path alignment improved additional

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,649
ways added we're continuing will need

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,199
server further surveys and then

00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,839
inevitably not on anonymous comment but

00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:57,649
above my me from the name of the person

00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:01,249
and

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:02,689
another element which is to say again

00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:06,369
this when I picked up because I then

00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:08,470
visited it in February made some changes

00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:11,779
uploaded photos to my pillory

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:14,420
did some house numbering and then

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:16,360
actually 18 days ago Donald originally

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,879
rate the node being back out again

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,290
that's more surveying but actually you

00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,119
can see there's still a big area of

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,100
development there there's still a big

00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:26,509
area to fill so probably bad nodes

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,600
probably gonna be open for another year

00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:31,279
maybe even two years before actually

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,100
that's complete so you're kind of

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:39,259
tracking these these projects over many

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,819
years yeah as well as kind of building

00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:42,949
sites kind of big infrastructure

00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:47,149
projects fall into the same thing we had

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:49,639
a big new Road bridge built and again

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:50,779
that project went on for we kind of

00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,920
tracked it from when I was there was a

00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,809
note probably added when it was first

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,610
proposed we had the committee in

00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:58,279
construction phase we had the opening

00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,929
stage actually one stage I think they're

00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,850
probably like four different notes open

00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:03,470
about the different aspects of it the

00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,839
actual bridge construction the

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,069
construction areas the speed limit

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,029
changes on the different Road so

00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:10,490
actually you've kind of got a whole load

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:12,529
of things that can I group together that

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,600
are interesting and actually open over a

00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,749
number of years before we actually

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,999
closed them so I kind of been thinking

00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:22,790
about ideas to try and kind of make

00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:26,929
these a bit easier to manage my first

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,009
thought was try using a bug tracker so I

00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,779
think we did the string with one of the

00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:34,370
pub meetups we created an issue tracker

00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:35,899
on github just to put some of the some

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,579
of the issues that we found again as a

00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:41,329
way of just trying to manage them the

00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:43,040
long term kind of project and it's quite

00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:44,749
useful there's maybe four of us that

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,100
have kind of been doing it and you can

00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:50,929
do some quite nice things you can put

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:52,549
things into into you can use what's

00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:54,079
called milestones so you can put all

00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:55,759
your things into a milestone you can say

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,369
a date so we've got a list of things

00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:01,710
there that we want to we want to look at

00:12:58,369 --> 00:13:03,760
and investigate by the end of this year

00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:06,820
but it does lack a little bit of the

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,590
visibility the notes have I all sees

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,910
that one of the banks was closing a lot

00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,980
of branches so I actually have an issue

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,710
there and I just kind of made an a list

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,180
of of all the branches and when they

00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,530
were expecting to be closed and then we

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,510
can actually go through through those

00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,370
and close them on the appropriate day

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,200
and for that what I do is I then we just

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:28,090
add a reminder for the next date so I

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,920
can get to say that I need to go make

00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,510
those changes so that's kind of nearly

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,390
done that when I can close it seen and

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,380
actually most of those branches all of

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,850
them but some of them someone has

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,760
actually added a note to say oh this is

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,650
closing on on the state but I started

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,330
this in January and the last branch

00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,490
won't close until December so trying to

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,960
just gain follow something that was in

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,970
the news then there isn't gonna happen

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,200
till then I find quite a big challenge

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,940
we've also had an idea of using the wiki

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,160
as I've mentioned we Dingell there's a

00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,440
lot of new developments and there's a

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,690
really brilliant cycling map that was

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,570
printed on paper by the local cycle

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:07,180
campaigners and up to now it's will been

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,860
hand drawn but the person who's just

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,160
started updating it and started coming

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,180
to our pub meetings and actually they

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
said they were going to do is start

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,450
using it from street map data which was

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,640
great but actually missing some of the

00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,830
new developments so they like let's have

00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,660
an effort to try and map those so we

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,490
kind of have created a list on the wiki

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,560
again mostly pointing to the note and

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,370
it's another way of kind of organizing

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,230
little sub projects and it's useful but

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,760
only a few people know about it it's you

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,230
kind of unless you can tell everybody

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,770
you can use the made of this but not

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,730
everybody's gonna see that some of kind

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,760
of like games that are a way of

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,290
augmenting notes and when I proposed the

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,610
talk I was kinda hoping I'd have time to

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,790
write some code and actually prototype

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,860
something seemed like a good idea when

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,990
did we submit talks packet back instead

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:57,070
of April May time there's a long time to

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:58,720
to go south we're on by although there's

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,400
a diagram idea was found a little out

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,170
use the API and there may be a little

00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,210
slide database torment the dates and

00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,030
just have a I'm a play with it I think

00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,680
ultimately you'd want to end up on open

00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,180
stream app websites but I think it's can

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,560
also nice to have a play with data and

00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,600
have a look at it and see what works and

00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,939
what's useful before we have to commit

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,099
to

00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:17,569
thing like that yeah the ideas would be

00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:22,579
that you could color filter notes based

00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:24,559
on age based on the last comment because

00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:26,029
actually sometimes you can just if

00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,099
someone's lip to the no in the last few

00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:29,839
weeks it may be a very old note back so

00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:33,259
you probably don't need to go back to to

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,849
it again and hide notes until a select a

00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:36,619
date and that would kind of cover the

00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:38,809
things we're actually we know that

00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:40,699
that's not gonna happen until then but

00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:43,339
you want to then reappear kind of fresh

00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:45,109
from that point on maybe even the

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:48,229
ability to add tags in the generic way

00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:51,470
could be useful and that could maybe you

00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:53,029
also cover cover doing the dates so lots

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,289
of ideas doesn't have time to do

00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,149
anything I don't think any of its

00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:57,529
actually too complicated to do some I'm

00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,989
still planning on having it having a

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:02,989
look at that um I did just laid some the

00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:04,579
data into QGIS and try some coloring

00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:08,479
butter playing so this is kind of

00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:10,399
coloring where the light white as the

00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:11,749
new notes going to read which is the old

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,399
notes by actually I found it quite hard

00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:15,499
to see the really new notes I kind of

00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,799
experimented a bit I changed the colors

00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:20,029
around and I added blue for brand new

00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:21,319
notes notes that have been there for

00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:23,359
less than 10 days and I think that's

00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:25,849
quite a mouthful actually I think there

00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:29,029
is something in this there's probably

00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:30,499
more to play with from that I think that

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,329
we can yeah I think you can see the

00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:34,279
potential of actually doing that I did

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:35,929
find a website which I'll mention in a

00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:38,329
moment and I've kind of done a few

00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:40,819
diagrams you can expand it out to the

00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:44,059
world so those are all the open notes in

00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:45,229
the world kind of is I guess it's the

00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:48,739
areas that you would expect that a

00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:50,659
colored and the close notes I'll just

00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:51,919
kind of also interested to see what

00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:54,949
happens if you layer them on top of each

00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,599
other so you can lay them on top so

00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:58,099
you've got the blue of the notes that

00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:00,499
have been closed the orange of the notes

00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:02,209
that are still open I think you kind of

00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:04,309
get an idea of activities and parts the

00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:07,039
world where actually maybe no thomething

00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:08,360
looked at and managed and in the same

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,569
way as they are in other parts of the

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,759
world I was really curious by some of

00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,980
these clusters in the center of Africa

00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,809
here I was just kind of looking at this

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,789
this morning and I thought it was kind

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:22,399
of an interesting sound interesting come

00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,480
on serve notes though I thought a lot of

00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:26,929
notes

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:30,500
but they're all identical anybody got

00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:32,660
any idea where why some of them are even

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,780
from the same person I don't know if

00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:38,600
there's an automatic tool or anybody

00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:41,299
anyway there we are I thought that was

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,460
just a really curious curious set of

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:46,130
notes so you kind of got that ability to

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,740
to find notes and query them and maybe

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,030
even cluster them together so actually

00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:56,929
notes that are similar I that you could

00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:58,340
you can cover so yeah I'm that max

00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:01,220
that's kind of a zoomed in view of

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:04,160
Europe with the same view and open

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,270
eighths and the same thing so there are

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,490
some existing tools

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:09,260
not many there's lots of tools that will

00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:11,000
tell you your notes and your comments

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,760
but nothing that really helps you manage

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,740
notes I did find this one here notes

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,870
review actually looks quite good it's

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,549
kind of does the job though it's it's

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,110
very much hidden and took me a fair bit

00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:22,850
of there's a link there is a link to

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,500
from one of the pages in the wiki and

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:28,429
it's quite nice to clusters the notes

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,809
and it does age based coloring but

00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:31,820
probably likes like some of the

00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:34,340
visibility that we have from other

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:38,030
places I've got some other ideas for

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:39,770
tools that I think would be useful are

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,419
they be useful to just have some some

00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,100
tools that connect analyze and group

00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:44,419
notes by arias you can actually look at

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,130
your city and go how many nodes are

00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:50,150
there how well are we doing at closing

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,470
notes that kind of thing I thought that

00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,410
something like that might exist but it

00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,880
doesn't seem to I'd also love something

00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,710
that helped me find notes near our paths

00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,450
if you're going on a ride or a drive and

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,340
you've got a GPS track probably more

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,720
suitable for bike rides actually if you

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,000
could load that in and say just tell me

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,290
any notes within 200 meters of that and

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,970
then you actually know what stuff needs

00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:11,720
to be looked out for I think that would

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:13,640
be really handy not quite at the end of

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,080
another few minutes I've got a few few

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,750
interesting examples of notes that I

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,070
found recently again when I was

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,070
preparing the talk as looking for new

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,900
notes there was a note about island

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,700
disappearing from the transport map oh

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,770
this is kind of an an interesting

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,990
example where actually I think probably

00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:32,090
most users wouldn't know what to do with

00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:35,129
that

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:38,279
it certainly has gone I meant I sent

00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:39,389
Andy a tweet around this back she is I

00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,860
kind of know my role

00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:42,419
let's check the coastline there's not

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,700
been any changes it all looks good so

00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,929
actually that's definitely something for

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,269
that particular layer rather than a

00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:49,980
generic problem but that's good to know

00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:52,710
this almost quite funny this is adding

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,720
to a castle and I don't know what are

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:58,019
those notes on there and I found that

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,659
one of them I'd left seven months ago I

00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:02,840
have no recollection of leaving that

00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:05,070
note where I got my information from

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,029
there's a whiskey shot I was like it's

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,110
that really that there can't be a

00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:11,940
whiskey shop in the middle of the castle

00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,440
maybe I was maybe I was yeah maybe I had

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,789
been drinking too much actually I did a

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,740
quick look and there is a whiskey shop

00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:18,809
in the castle so I need to go in and

00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:23,159
have a look and maybe maybe buy some

00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:25,320
whiskey and check where it is say so I

00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:28,679
was that was a kind of no idea how I did

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,149
that one and this is the oldest note if

00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,389
anybody was wondering that's still open

00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:35,039
in OpenStreetMap I put the comments

00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:37,320
through Google Translate and as far as I

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,490
can tell it was closed and someone with

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,820
the comment which is well if you've not

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,559
mapped the inside corridor in the

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,690
supermarket you never get a map but the

00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,429
person that opened the note did reopen

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:52,169
the note so I guess they still intend to

00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:54,990
but haven't got there yet and that's

00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:58,100
that's me done if I was interesting

00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,100
any questions or thoughts

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:06,759
[Applause]

00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:22,850
was that oh yeah just did you what the

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,580
Mike friend that's coming just if you're

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,679
working around this money valve just so

00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,230
the people on the live stream can be

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,100
okay just a little bit of encouragement

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:36,020
for you the OpenStreetMap UK local

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,919
chapters just set the next cautionary

00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:41,360
project is gonna be on notes so I sort

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,400
of encourage them as well because I said

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:50,809
excellent interested so maybe you could

00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:53,120
build yeah I've got questions so you

00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,880
touched on that before it was a separate

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,370
website and of course it's better having

00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,220
it on the website where other people see

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,650
it you taught me a lot about visibility

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:06,080
and that's also through the API which is

00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:08,870
how you can access things or it can be

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,080
an idea yeah so do you think

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:14,690
but API and the notes feature itself

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,059
needs to be extended or anything that

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,549
could be done yeah I think ultimately I

00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,990
think probably it'll be interesting to

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:22,610
see whether people think I think there's

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,470
only been able to find a little bit more

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,780
information I think there's probably a

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,520
danger they make them too complicated so

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,320
didn't you want to get too far down the

00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,410
bug tracking system certainly I think

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,390
having a date feel would be or a way of

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,380
adding dates to notes I think to say

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,140
actually we don't need to worry about

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,570
this know until that date to me that's

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,820
be really handy if it just reappeared on

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,650
my feed on that date and I could then go

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,140
and have a look at it certainly other

00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:50,000
people have kind of mentioned the same I

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,919
think that's how I said you know there's

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,380
selling in Scotland there's lots of us

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,270
looking at feeds of notes I don't know

00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,830
how other people deal with them in other

00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,960
parts of the world I definitely

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,520
encourage people to look at keep an eye

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,710
on their local notes and follow the

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,540
feeds because it is a really good way of

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,210
getting feedback and it's a good way of

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,070
finding problems and coughin and silly

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,550
people do report problems on the map say

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:15,850
yeah maybe we should do

00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:19,240
hashtags in them of long-term or ready

00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:21,670
you know but I do yeah as you say lots

00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,430
of question any another question

00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:33,010
Oh got this chap here look at the race

00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:36,100
legged race everyone just sat closer and

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:39,700
budget up it might be easier let's maybe

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:42,280
your opinion on a more detailed system

00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,980
like maps dots me so that you can say

00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,170
like this is closed or and there's

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:51,160
something new here like differentiate

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:53,500
about types of notes like a notes for a

00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,400
new building or a note that's deleted

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,180
building or something

00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,460
yeah like certainly I would find that

00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,200
useful to be able to classify things as

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,910
two different types of things we did a

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,670
bit of that without github issues we can

00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,960
I said there's a long-term project I

00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:10,020
think the danger would be that you make

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,520
the note system too complicated and

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,860
heavy with features that actually only a

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,150
handful of power users use I think if

00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,800
you were to do anything I think you'd

00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,380
probably want to slowly think very

00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,510
carefully before you overloaded it too

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,160
much that's why maybe at Aggie type

00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,580
system where you get our tags two things

00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,860
could be

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,720
certainly the OpenStreetMap way of doing

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,960
it but even then I don't know if that's

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,190
totally necessary or not as I say that's

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,400
why I would be good to just have a play

00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:38,730
round

00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,030
I've really enjoyed listening to and

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:44,140
I've been doing some work on the API and

00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,420
know this is definitely something that

00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,490
needs lots of internal refactoring yeah

00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,010
so if people have suggestions as to what

00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:53,590
can be done to the external level that

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,900
would help then please let me know

00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,450
Firebug group report or something like

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,580
that and I'm very interested in it but

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,780
if we leave the API aside I was

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:07,120
interested by the graphs assured of the

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,500
rate of opening and the rate of closing

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,510
and the rate of closing has always

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,960
persistently behind the rate of opening

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:18,130
yeah and so the number of open box is

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:21,039
increasing the film wall-e springs to

00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:24,309
man was your thoughts on the long term

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:27,370
like will notes be useful in five years

00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:29,919
time if they just keep on open notes

00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:33,610
increases and increases do we need to

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:36,809
look at automatically get rid of some of

00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:39,610
the untouched ones or things like that

00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:42,070
yeah and I think it's a really tricky

00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,480
one because suddenly I think it probably

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,279
depends in the areas because certainly

00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,110
there's areas like we certainly in

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,789
Scotland most of the notes of relative

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:52,149
it's only in the central power are very

00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:53,620
well generally watched but it ready we

00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:55,000
get into the situation where we're

00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:00,190
missing stuff because there's so many

00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,020
things that are in progress and so I

00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,370
think maybe yeah you should maybe if a

00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,440
notes not being touched for a certain

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,510
length of time it should maybe get close

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,520
I thought that that oldest note was

00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,130
interesting because actually someone had

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,080
come and closed it and the person who

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:15,130
the opened it was reopened and actually

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,539
were in some ways that's great because

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,250
it means that there is someone who still

00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:20,470
cares about it so I guess actually

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,909
you're right I think even closing notes

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,710
and let people reopen them if they're

00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:25,000
interested in them would maybe either be

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,100
the way to do it but I'd probably do it

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,990
based on last time there was an update

00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,090
you know maybe if you go a year without

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:33,970
any updates to note that probably means

00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:36,010
they it's actually up about itself might

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:38,140
be enough to when the people see that

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,000
their notes plays to reopen it as well

00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,440
so actually that's probably actually

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,970
might might solve some of the problems

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,029
and all certainly the worst cases of

00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:48,809
them I think here there's not a question

00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:48,809
on question

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,730
thanks Chris great talk from my

00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:04,470
perspective it's more of a comment I'm

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,049
making it from my perspective I think

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:09,539
the notes are quite abused from what

00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:11,970
I've seen people are just putting random

00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:14,429
comments on there that don't necessarily

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,980
relate to the map they might be kind of

00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:19,470
odd debates that people are having and

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,200
that's another factor I think from some

00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:25,799
of your ideas of maybe we need to close

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,649
Nate so if to a certain time period I've

00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,419
also seen them used as this is a place

00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:33,240
to get your drugs and here's a telephone

00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:35,250
number to call so I think we need to

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,110
have some sort of mechanism to perhaps

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,610
managing them a bit more effectively

00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:42,510
than they're being managed at the moment

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:45,090
yeah yeah it's only my experience of

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,440
those they're probably in Edinburgh

00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,630
that's probably one of those a month

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,559
maybe so it's not a big volume of them

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,490
but it's definitely if you're not

00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:55,140
watching it they do increase say yeah my

00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,580
feeling is but we've not had lots of

00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,340
abuse of it is actually I'm the

00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,440
anonymous they'd be more useful and not

00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,179
Sonia making people sign up for comments

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,399
I think definitely makes sense and it

00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:06,750
prevents the opposite side so I think

00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:10,320
there's a balance there as well between

00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,309
between going and doing and probably the

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,710
other thing with saying is actually

00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:15,029
having you know certainly there's

00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,890
certain people that leave notes and we

00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:19,289
know we trust them and you just go and

00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,210
acts on what they say because you've

00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:21,809
certainly seen it enough times that

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,279
they're right

00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:24,809
where's other people if it's a new use

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,580
or an anonymous user it's usually you

00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:31,010
didn't want to check it out first as

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:33,360
well so there's a lot of work that

00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:36,320
really thank you Jason

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,320
