Title: 2019: What's behind JOSM?
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	JOSM is almost as old as OSM but few people really know what it takes to maintain your preferred editor.
We'll present the development model of JOSM and who's part of its active community: developers, translators, testers, plugin authors, end users, sponsors, etc.
We'll talk about the project difficulties, the major achievements made in the past years, what work is currently in progress and what will happen in the near future!

welcome everybody here at the afternoon

00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:18,689
session of the second day of Sodom 2019

00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:21,720
we start with a session now with an

00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:29,099
intro with the talk from Vincent Viva

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:31,829
about the Joseph project and I'm Vincent

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,710
from France and I'm one of the most

00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:37,440
active contributors of jism so Java

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,450
OpenStreetMap editor so as an

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,350
introduction some quick facts about

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,739
Joseph you might know it as the oldest

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,350
and most being used editor still

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:53,010
actively developed it was created only

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,739
one year after Wesson itself its

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,710
particularity it's as a rich set of

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,949
feature and the editor is greatly

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,559
extensible so through many possible

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,100
extensions it is available on all

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,530
platforms Linux Windows Mac OS it is

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,860
translated in a vast number of languages

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,430
it benefits from an important community

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:22,260
of users and you can check his website

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:26,280
as Japan's rapid de as it is originally

00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:28,770
a German project my talk is divided in

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,400
four parts the first one will be the

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,760
tech stuff then I will talk more about

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,510
how we work we make Joe Sam I will show

00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,060
you some interesting statistics and

00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:44,460
finally I'll conclude with what are we

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,760
working on right now and what you can

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,960
expect in the years to come

00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:56,340
so first the tech stuff if we sum up

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,370
Jotham what it does as an editor its

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,910
main goal is to load edit render

00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:06,450
validate and upload different kind of

00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:08,519
data related to OpenStreetMap so I'm of

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,680
course talking about why some data

00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:14,560
itself with the original XML form

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,700
and since larger we support an

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,480
alternative JSON format we also support

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:26,049
traces with your original JPEGs from at

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,349
and since last month this is quite new

00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:33,280
we support article in which is a high

00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:37,599
precision centimetric format and we also

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:41,349
support with some notes 12 cube editing

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,290
this data we offer a large range of a

00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:47,590
detainee search and filtering tours with

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,920
also a remote control possibility from

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:54,160
external systems we have many possible

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,370
extensions so you you know probably the

00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,120
OSM presets but it is also true for

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:04,090
mapping styles validation rules image

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,760
resources using various protocols you

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:11,970
can also display geotag picture and also

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:15,400
run audio recording in various formats

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:19,120
concerning the technologies itself

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:23,019
Jotham is built using java version 8 or

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,370
later and is built using the swing frame

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:30,510
UI framework that is shipped with java

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:35,040
we have very few software dependencies

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:37,959
here is the exhaustive list you can see

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,129
these dependencies are designed for very

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:45,400
specific parts of jozin we tend to make

00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:47,530
all the possible work ourselves to keep

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,459
Joe Sam as light as possible because

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,799
binary size is important to us I have

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,319
brought the last two dependencies

00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,440
because they are written in JavaScript

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,000
and unlike the other one which are Java

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,340
dependencies there sure is at risk

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,780
because of recent changes in

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:14,200
governance by Oracle in terms of

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,109
extension the main way to extend Rossum

00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:21,310
is by plugins the community has created

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:24,120
more than 100 plugins so this is only a

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:27,550
brief list of the most popular plugins

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:31,540
regrouped in five categories you can

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:34,870
find first plugins that had new data

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:38,410
formats and protocols then a lot of

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:42,630
plugins that had more advanced editing

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:45,250
tools especially the riveter plugins

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,880
next we have plugins that had

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,990
integration with various ecosystems

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,300
around the OpenStreetMap

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,330
I'm thinking about my theory or

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,720
Wikipedia for example then we are very

00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,850
specialized or localized tools for

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,880
specific countries and we are very

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,910
technical plugins that are not real

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,300
plugins but just piece of software that

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:13,990
ship libraries required by other plugins

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:18,010
you can if you interested in writing

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:22,720
more plugins you can find the developer

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:27,250
guide after plugins we have preset I'm

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,260
sure you all know them presets are being

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,849
defined using your very simple syntax

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,830
using XML language is table for years so

00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:38,800
if you want more details here's the

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:44,260
documentation on the jaws my key tagging

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,780
presets next we have my pen stylus the

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:50,139
define using a specific language which

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:53,919
is map CSS which is basically CSS for

00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:57,160
maps the syntax is very powerful it

00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:00,940
allows you to do many many things and we

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:04,000
in continuously improve almost every

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,580
release if you want more details same

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,370
you have the wiki map CSS implementation

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:14,229
and we have also say

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:17,110
syntax being used for validator rules so

00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:20,080
with this syntax you can check or some

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:23,260
data for potential arrows and also

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,470
define potential fixes to fix the data

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:29,410
if you want more specific details on

00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,840
this I'll refer you to the slide being

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,600
presented this morning by Clarisse from

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:39,190
XR which are really great to get more

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,889
insight on this feature now some words

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:46,600
about project management how do we work

00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:49,330
who are we it is odd to define a real

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,510
current team because we are all

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:56,260
believers so we work on our free time so

00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:59,530
the team evolves depending on the time

00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,350
available for each other so in the last

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:05,110
few years I counted we were 9 developers

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:08,979
were committed directory on the SVN

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:12,789
repository for about 2000 commits so the

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:15,580
other list we are all from Europe from

00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:19,000
Germany France Austria and Poland and

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:23,289
here is a rare picture of chosen

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,380
developers eating pizzas and coding it

00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:32,320
was at the invitation of real fabric

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:34,060
last year in Carrboro jasm is not just

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,300
about the qur'an team

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:41,770
Jotham was built by many people before

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:44,230
us so the historic team counts about 30

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:48,130
developers in the last 14 years of

00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:53,050
development so you can see the red crazy

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:54,790
guy it's me I joined in 2011 after the

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,790
departure thank you

00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:00,550
after the departure of the original

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:03,340
creator will help the project before I

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,990
join you can say we had a peak of

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,520
activity in 2016 that was because we

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:13,270
participated in google Summer of Code

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,120
and we had a very talented student who

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:19,870
later joined the team and you can see

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,670
Joe Sam is still actively developed 2019

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:26,070
is still not finished yet

00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:29,880
so the bar will increase Joe Sam is not

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:34,150
only about coders we also have

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:38,320
translation teams we are we have a lot

00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:41,290
of people translating Jotham in 36

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,620
languages and this is huge work because

00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:47,260
Joe Sam represents more than 11,000

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:50,110
strains to translate so it's almost

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:54,250
impossible to do it by yourself you must

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:58,210
be several we lack some major languages

00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,580
such as Arabic so this is something

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:03,940
where you can help us to provide more

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,850
languages so if you are interesting to

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:10,720
add your own language please come see me

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:13,270
and I will explain you in terms of

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,390
development cycle we release a new

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:18,070
latest version and you later development

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,770
version each night

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,710
and a new stable version at the end of

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:29,110
each month when the stable version is

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:32,140
not so stable we can release odd fixes a

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,810
few days later if required for example

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:39,370
when we have critical bugs or an

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:44,380
external change not caused by us in

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:47,830
terms of we distribute jasm to end-users

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:51,040
we recommend Java Web Start which is a

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:54,400
multi-platform and very efficient way to

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,550
get chosen but we also provide native

00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,400
binaries on each platform also as a

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:04,270
plain jar file you can download using

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:07,420
your own script in terms of governance

00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:10,900
we are an independent project we don't

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:13,530
depend from anyone neither z/osmf nor

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,660
working group now private companies but

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:21,160
we have some sponsoring a few more

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:23,320
details just after if we if chosen add a

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,470
motto it would be awesome community

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:30,820
before all we really care about the

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:33,700
community is USM community this is clear

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,250
in all of what we do for example

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,740
everything we do is publicly discussed

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:43,360
on the back tracker we all know

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:46,630
anonymous ticket the choices we make

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:51,550
when adding new presets are gurdy are

00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:54,280
guided but by what the OSM community

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:57,730
decided on tagging mailing lists or on

00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:01,480
the USM wiki so we don't create tags

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:05,590
ourselves this is also true when we

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,830
perform technical migrations from one

00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:11,150
version of Java to the next one we only

00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:14,900
do it when

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:17,840
at least 19% of user already run this

00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:21,790
fashion so this quite up transparent for

00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:25,130
almost of you in terms of sponsors I

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:27,860
distinguish direct sponsor will

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:30,860
contribute directly for the Jotham core

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:34,640
project so I would like to thank here

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:38,980
especially to its now we'll provide it

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:42,800
for free our server for six years and

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:45,260
first kiss will provides us a cutscene

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,830
yet effective certificate for three

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,960
years now and the new server since the

00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,800
last since the beginning of this year

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:59,830
and we also have other company will

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:04,030
provide us developer tools we are also

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:07,340
indirect sponsor I'm speaking about

00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:11,000
companies we've right show some plugins

00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:14,740
and make make them available sorry to

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,660
the awesome community so the biggest

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:21,260
company will make such plugins is tell

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:23,570
enough you can find them in all they

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,510
created a lot of different plugins to

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,350
help on the pro improvement of

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:33,350
OpenStreetMap we have also either

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:35,780
Microsoft and Madeira working on their

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,170
respective plugin and we also

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:45,050
participate in the Oktoberfest

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:48,860
event which is created by Geetha so I

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:51,320
talked about the chasm server we are a

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,020
standalone project so we have our own

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,740
infrastructure so the server runs

00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,530
everything

00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,980
it runs the project website built on

00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:03,710
track we asked the ticket system going

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,380
to reporters and feature requests as

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,360
well as the official SVN repository we

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,230
have an online

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,200
Delp accessible from jism itself we have

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:18,370
the message of the day that is displayed

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:21,970
when you run chosen and we list the

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:24,310
available extensions and we are CI and

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:28,959
create tools to help us to improve

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:33,190
Jotham for the continuous integration

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:36,640
system it is built using Jenkins it runs

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:39,250
of course unit tests everyday but we

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:43,180
also have integration tests that allow

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:47,050
us to check that jasm work with latest

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,130
and greatest version of openjdk and we

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,970
check that

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:55,269
Jotham is well integrated with ecosystem

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:59,529
such as map ER e or Wikipedia or we

00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:03,370
check if our tags our some tags defined

00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:07,269
as popular integral as included in

00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:10,959
chosen presets one of the daily checks

00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:13,690
we make manual checks or semi-automated

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,980
are the checks of validity of

00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:23,560
translations of plugins and various

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:27,459
extensions one particular time-consuming

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:31,029
task and kind of ungrateful work is to

00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:34,089
check the validity of image resources so

00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:38,380
each image resource you can display in

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:42,490
JSON is listed and on the wiki there are

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:45,910
almost 800 sources and of course each

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:48,790
day a few of them are failing so the

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:53,890
task is to detect temporary failures

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:56,829
from real real failures or dead links so

00:14:53,890 --> 00:15:01,690
it requires quite a lot of time as this

00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:05,769
is almost invisible now I will show you

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:08,860
some interesting statistics first of all

00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:11,440
the number of active contributors so

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,340
you can see in the last 10 years it

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,520
varied between two and eight

00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:21,760
contributors per month so with an

00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:25,210
average with about four to five people

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:29,430
each month so it's very active and I'm

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:33,160
battle particulary glad said that since

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:38,140
2007 we had never less than two people

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:41,110
contributing to Joseph in terms of lines

00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:45,790
of code this is a very big project you

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:48,850
can see we have more than three hundred

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:51,520
and thousand lines for two hundred and

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:57,880
cells and lines of code this is really

00:15:51,520 --> 00:16:01,330
big in terms of Binnorie size I'm proud

00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:06,550
we can still count the size of Johson

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:10,000
binary in Cairo bytes so it's only 13 to

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:14,940
14 megabytes today we have a linear

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:19,270
progression and you can see in 2011 we

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:22,270
managed to reduce the size that's where

00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:25,390
that's when we switch from the old

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:31,360
rendering system based on very verbose

00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:33,450
XML to the new map CSS language in terms

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,960
of tickets

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:40,620
this is difficult for us you can see the

00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:45,330
number of open tickets always increase

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:49,170
we cannot cope with the extremely high

00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:51,930
amount of tickets created each month and

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:55,920
Rosenberg tracker we still managed to

00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:58,740
close many of them but each bond as a

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,490
number of open tickets increase so this

00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:06,270
is also well you can help us to find

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:11,340
duplicate or write better description or

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:15,720
even better provider matches now I have

00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:20,730
two statistics about all of things but

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:24,530
not of us of you this one is about the

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:27,510
reporters so the list includes in yellow

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:31,650
people of the team so I don't count them

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:34,710
I'm only interested in blue people who

00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,050
are not members of the team so you can

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:41,430
see since the beginning of the project

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:46,320
we have 5 users who have created at

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:48,360
least 150 valid tickets tickets which

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:54,870
have been fixed by us

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:58,320
so thanks many signs to them another

00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:02,730
Hall of Fame is to people would provide

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:06,150
patches to us so same colors and in blue

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:09,060
you can see we have 7 users who provided

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:12,330
at least 20 patches that's a large

00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:18,150
amount so many other people who provided

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:19,670
less touches another interesting diagram

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:24,140
is

00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:27,320
versions of Java we required across our

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:30,350
14 years of existence when Jotham was

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,020
created it was using Java 5 which was

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:38,450
the latest version available at that

00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:42,920
time we are now requiring Java 8 which

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:45,740
is still supported today so we add three

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:49,280
different migrations to perform to

00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:54,830
switch from one version to another so as

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:57,620
I said before we wait that as sufficient

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,770
users run the target version before we

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:03,770
consider switching but we have also

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:06,920
other factors to consider

00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:10,220
twice the migration was blocked by the

00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:14,000
availability of the new Java version in

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:17,360
ubuntu LTS long term support because

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,940
this is by far the most popular Linux

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:25,220
distribution used by Linux jasm users

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:28,550
you can see the release cycle of Java

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:31,880
change quite a lot so the next version

00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:35,540
of Java we consider after 8 is not 9

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:38,960
it's 11 because now we have temporary

00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:42,770
version we don't really care about so we

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,940
will have LTS versions like operating

00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:49,760
system but we're not sure yet about when

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,640
we will be able to switch to Java 11

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:58,460
probably next year but not premised on

00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:00,470
that finally the last section is what

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,900
are we working on and what can you

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:06,810
expect in the years to come

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:09,900
we are currently modernizing or up our

00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:12,960
stuff we are using the lot of old

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:17,940
technologies that were up to the 18 2005

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:21,030
knots or more in 2011 19 so we need it

00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,970
first to that a Newport server this is

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:26,250
done thanks to first kiss and

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:30,420
OpenStreetMap France then we are

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:34,380
currently working on switching from SVN

00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:40,230
to gate launch pad translation system to

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:42,930
transifex from a singer and scattered

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,930
repository across get AB plus our

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:49,170
repository centralized everything on a

00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:51,740
dedicated get lab instance and tools

00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:55,800
from ant to mavin and or greater and

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:58,950
also the same for PNG icons for two

00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:02,910
scalable SVG files and you can see

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:07,860
here's the list of tickets tracking all

00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:11,220
of these subjects another big work that

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:13,650
is going to take many years we are

00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,850
trying to modularize the application

00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:20,520
currently the application is a giant

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:23,730
block and if you're interested in

00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,550
reusing some parts of Jotham for your

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:30,330
own java project is currently quite

00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:33,720
difficult so we want to ease this and we

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:38,960
also want to is maintenance for us and

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:43,260
also richly more to new Java developers

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:47,670
so we have a master ticket which will

00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:50,850
live several years this is the current

00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:55,050
state of materialization so you can see

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:58,800
everything depends on everything so it's

00:21:55,050 --> 00:22:02,450
difficult ly maintainable and this is

00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,220
the target so we will have a lot more

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,710
components but without

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:13,669
interdependences so it will be easier to

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:18,299
maintainer and finally the last subject

00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:23,070
it's about the complex situation of Java

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:27,750
today it I could give a talk just about

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:31,799
this so in a few words Oracle which is a

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:36,360
company which maintains Java today made

00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:39,150
major changes last year this has a lot

00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:42,659
of impacts for us because they now focus

00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:45,600
on the cloud and on several technologies

00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:48,809
only so they dropped a lot of

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,240
technologies used by clients so this has

00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:54,179
a lot of impact for us and this is why I

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,549
cannot say when we will be able to

00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:00,059
switch to Java 11 we have a lot of

00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:02,880
different technical problems to solve so

00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:06,240
if you want more details you can reach

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,480
me on Twitter or on Jason mailing list

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,380
and are the main links to provide

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,360
documentation you can find this site

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:19,200
releases Creative Commons and Wikimedia

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,420
Commons thank you for your attention

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,420
[Applause]

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:32,229
yes Thank You Vincent for the great talk

00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:34,210
about two dozen programs so we have time

00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:36,479
for questions are there any questions in

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,479
the audience

00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,129
thank you for the interesting talk I

00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:51,820
wonder if you're ever encountered a

00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:53,589
situation in which there's different

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:57,190
opinions within the team of developers

00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:59,440
valid you merge a certain proposal or

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:04,450
not and if so how you resolve such

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:09,399
situations I'm sorry it's about the

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:11,409
motivation no yes

00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:14,619
so do you ever encounter the situation

00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:17,320
in which someone proposes a poor request

00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,999
and the active developers don't agree

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,309
whether it's good or request or not

00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:24,969
that's basically my question is your

00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:30,039
agreement between each we agree each

00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:32,519
other yeah yes as I said everything is

00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:36,429
discussed publicly on the back tracker

00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:40,719
we usually agree each other as well as

00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:42,849
we agree with the OSM community so we

00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:47,049
don't have any particular situation

00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:49,989
where we have disputes or failing to

00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:53,559
reach consensus but sometimes it can

00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:58,509
happen sometimes we can also make wrong

00:24:53,559 --> 00:25:01,330
choices which has reported later by

00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:05,909
other people and which is usually

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:09,309
without Probab probably Matic changes so

00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:12,070
globally Jotham is an active family and

00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:16,839
we live well together with your some

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:17,500
community as well are there more

00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:20,730
questions

00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,730
[Music]

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:27,090
thank you there's this modularity that

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:30,980
you're aiming for does that have any

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:35,610
risks alongside it such as the

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:39,360
maintenance of steam yeah of course

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:43,559
there are risk every time we change the

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:48,029
source code but it's also easier for us

00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:50,940
when we switch from this to this it's

00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:54,690
easier for us to test it we have big

00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:58,110
problems on testability of the software

00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:02,090
so I think it will actually improve the

00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,090
quality of Joe's own source code

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:18,370
I'm innocent where are you here just a

00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:22,870
question with respect to moving the

00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:26,110
translations to transifex I know this is

00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:29,920
a slight a political issue but would you

00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:31,900
consider moving the translations into

00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,850
the open Street and project on trans

00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,500
effects instead of keeping it separate

00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:38,460
because that would have the big

00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:42,010
advantage of being able to share

00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:45,610
translations and increase the number of

00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:48,420
translations available for for Joseph

00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:50,800
and other projects which are the group

00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:55,030
how to touch the issue for those that

00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:58,150
don't know is licensed but there might

00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:00,730
be ways to work around that it's a good

00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:03,760
idea it's currently difficult to get a

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:06,970
lot of translators and so it's kind of

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,920
redundant work to translate almost the

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:12,880
same strings between the different

00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:15,700
editors so we didn't consider it yet but

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,850
it sounds an ID we can work together on

00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,850
this

00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:25,130
no more questions okay so if there are

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,560
no more question

00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:30,170
thanks again Vincent for the tour okay

00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:33,010
and you have time now okay

00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,010
