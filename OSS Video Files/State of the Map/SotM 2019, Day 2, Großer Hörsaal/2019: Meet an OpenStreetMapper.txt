Title: 2019: Meet an OpenStreetMapper
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	We've learnt about many projects and clever systems that run OpenStreetMap possible, but it's the individuals that are most valuable in what we do. Settle down in your seats as Gregory introduces you to a selection of OSMers and informally chats to them about their involvement. When, how, and why did they join OSM? What do they do in the project? Has that changed? What's their favourite map tag? All these questions and more will potentially be asked.

The OpenStreetMappers that Gregory met were Tasauf (Ribin),  Jorieke, Dermot (mackerski), and Chris.

Come to the talk to find out which OpenStreetMappers we will be having a conversation with.
Gregory held back from joining until he met some OSM guys in the UK in 2006. You may have seen him shout "Maps" on the stage, but he really enjoys chatting to people in the breaks. If it's your first time or you've got every SotM t-shirt that exists, do find him and say hello.

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,550
would like to introduce the panel led by

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:29,730
grigory Manor on meeting or Penn State

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,440
member thank you hello so I should

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,440
probably explain if you're looking at

00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,420
your booklet I'm not Paul I'm not

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,570
talking on an overview of map serving

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,089
architecture he couldn't quite get

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,530
details of it sorted but he is here at

00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:47,339
the conference if you want to go and

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,890
talk to him so filling in with this

00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,719
isn't very well planned I want to invite

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,969
up my friends to come and join me on the

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,620
seats and we're gonna have a quite

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:03,290
relaxed kind of session here it's not

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:06,960
very well planned but this is meat and

00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,460
OpenStreetMap so get comfortable I'm

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
gonna ask these guys I know them a

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,360
little bit but we're gonna get to know

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,850
them similar to doing the coffee breaks

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,020
you might want to talk to people and ask

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,540
some questions

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:27,750
we've all got involved in the project in

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:32,210
different ways so we have here also

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,210
known as ribbon I'm from Bangladesh

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:45,119
we have Eureka Eureka I'm working for

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,250
MSF mid-south of frontier as missing

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,229
Maps coordinator and I'm also an upper

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,329
street map belgium lady i am Dermott by

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,549
mapping ideas micro ski I'm from Dublin

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,909
in Ireland used to be on the OSM f ort

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,640
and now I'm just taking it easy I'm

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,969
Chris I'm live in Scotland that I tend

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,950
to do a lot of mapping there my OSEM

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,149
username is also Chris Fleming so I kind

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,960
of kept it all very simple

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,940
oh um see ya I'll there I think it's

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,830
questions like that long most Chris

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,430
still has a microphone and

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,400
so I've known you probably the longest

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:25,890
do you want to say what year you first

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,520
heard about OpenStreetMap and how you

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,010
heard about it so I've been on

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,350
OpenStreetMap for a very long time

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,880
I think it was many years ago my parents

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,250
run a bed-and-breakfast I was trying to

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,440
create a map for their website and I was

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,480
kind of just looking for map data

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,340
basically I was gonna do code local

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,470
locations and I thought there must be

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,970
some source of this and I think I

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,950
discovered OpenStreetMap I think at that

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,020
stage it was there was no actual map on

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,190
the website it was just white dots but I

00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,980
cannot oh there's something interesting

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,990
in this and come on I'm still here so

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,209
there we go

00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,220
exciting I was also gonna explain at the

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,470
start that I've decided there's no wrong

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,250
question so yeah guys so that you can

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,160
relax it

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,560
if you ever say if maybe there's no

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,260
wrong answers but if you did say you

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,090
copy everything from Google Maps will be

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,420
kind and and maybe later I'll explain

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,940
why that isn't a good idea you know but

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,130
and that's how we do jokes but but we're

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,500
all learning in different ways also if

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,090
you guys don't want to answer a question

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,769
it's fine just say a next question

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,650
please and I'll probably ask someone

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,660
else something different and

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,310
particularly as yeah I don't know what

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,170
your answers are for everything good and

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,470
maybe it's not appropriate and maybe you

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,530
just don't know the answer say oh so

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:47,220
Chris say well you did you say

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:52,019
2009 six six oh wow that's it was a yeah

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,910
I'm old and you were very involved and I

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,980
feel you've recently come back to Penn

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,510
State well I think it probably varies so

00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,489
I'm used to go to a lot of the very

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,050
early state of the maps and I think it's

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,690
kind of a maybe it's a common pattern is

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,700
you then have children and suddenly all

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,400
my time is taken up by you looking after

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,320
small people you can take the mapping

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,720
sometimes but they've got quite a short

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,910
attention span so actually babies are

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,590
great because someone's awake you put

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,630
them in a sling you go for a walk you go

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,580
down that road you can go to pouring it

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,200
was fine but once they've kind of got

00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,460
their own opinions where they want to go

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,830
they're not always so interested in

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,270
going down that street that just to try

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,250
and find out a bit of information about

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,470
what houses there

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,060
so that kind of probably just slowed

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,520
down the amount of mapping I'm doing and

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,210
the involved and I kind of still stay

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,850
relatively involved with the local

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,530
community we've kind of got a good group

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,500
of local matters and we try and meet up

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,990
regularly ish kind of either every month

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,480
every kind a couple of months so I kind

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,400
of just try to encourage people more

00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,230
than Big Mac things actually have

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,480
occurred to me quite early on that I was

00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,920
going to map the city I live in I just

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,170
didn't have time so actually the best

00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,410
way of using my time whilst actually try

00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:02,390
and tell other people about it and yeah

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,860
I think the first talk I did I preached

00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,780
to the guy and he goes by the username

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,690
of Central America and he actually

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,800
mapped a lot of Edinburgh he's done

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,630
absolute bucketloads a mapping I think

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,910
lots of people have seen his username so

00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,140
actually that was much more useful for

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,430
me to go into a talk and tell people

00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,950
about it it's probably something always

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,210
to bear in mind actually is rather than

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,530
trying to do all the work itself if you

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,540
can kind of get three or four other

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,010
people than that that's actually a

00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,540
really good good use of time so I'll

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,120
probably be my top tip actually for

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,760
getting getting your city map as to to

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,100
try and get other people involved yeah

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,710
cool exciting um let's uh check on

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,980
determinate say Chris was that forward

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,350
you've parents pimpy got you interested

00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:45,080
maybe similar how did you hear about so

00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,820
I mean in my OpenStreetMap story on the

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,830
one hand I started just a little bit

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,330
later later than Christie but on the

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,040
other hand my OpenStreetMap story goes

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,960
right back to the year 2000 before

00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,270
OpenStreetMap itself existed because

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,240
they like quite a lot of people in the

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,890
early OpenStreetMap community um I came

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,450
up with the idea of OpenStreetMap myself

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,970
but then and then never never did

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,950
anything about it or at least okay I

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,610
think many people came up with aspects

00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:12,530
of the idea of OpenStreetMap so in my

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,270
situation that I had actually in the

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,130
year 2000 just moved home to Ireland

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,110
from Germany of all places I lived in

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,870
Munich for a number of years and with me

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,810
I took a car that I'd bought which had a

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,100
snazzy new navigation system of the kind

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,770
that was just becoming popular and

00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,960
available and and of course I got home

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,000
and had no Maps but also everywhere I

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,830
drove a little marker moving around on

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,630
the screen knowing where I was but

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,700
not being prepared to actually record

00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,830
that such that it could reuse it so it's

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,240
very easy from that standpoint to say

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,040
wouldn't it be good if I could just

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,960
remember where I've been and used that

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,510
as a kind of a crude map which of course

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,130
is very much the genesis of

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,380
OpenStreetMap so fast forward the year

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,150
2007 and I accidentally discovered the

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,890
existence every so often I would Google

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,230
to see if anyone had produced street

00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:00,650
level mapping digital mapping of Ireland

00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,210
and somehow my google search found a

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,100
story about the isle of wight mapping

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,600
party which was one I think probably I

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,070
don't know that it was the first mapping

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,640
party but it was the first systematic

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,920
attempt to to map a defiant region these

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,800
the Isle of Wight off the south coast of

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,180
England so once I discovered that it

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,380
existed that was basically it I was

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,730
hooked and then and let's hit from

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,890
Jericho wouldn't how did you get

00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,410
involved and how did he hear about I

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:32,390
didn't street map I heard about

00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:36,110
Overstreet after my boyfriend something

00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:39,200
good about him then and since then I

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:43,820
came here I think no I was like in the

00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:47,540
end of 2010 so he was using the data for

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:50,750
his job he's here also like one of the

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,520
sponsors now for his job and then I

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,060
showed it to me and I basically I liked

00:07:52,520 --> 00:08:01,160
it I was also at that time doing a

00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:02,870
summer job as a as a post delivery on my

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,000
bike going through the whole village

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,120
basically so I basically knew every

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,510
every house in our village every member

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,040
of every house in our village in the

00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,600
village in the forest because it is the

00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,310
first with all the house so I was

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,590
cycling basically every day through the

00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,720
whole village and I knew every every

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,940
house so that was just easy to map so

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,180
it's just map the house map the map the

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,730
number and go around and then my two

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,560
brothers oh yeah this was nice to do so

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,700
my two brothers but started also helping

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,830
out

00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,690
and and yeah we basically mapped the

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:39,020
whole village like this which was pretty

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:43,220
fun and then also I got to hear about

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:46,550
the whole humanitarian part of the thing

00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:49,090
not necessarily about about the whole

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:53,870
disaster mapping but more about the

00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:56,420
community projects as map Khepera so

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,070
really mapping with local local citizens

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,580
their local environments and I really

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,350
got inspired me and basically it got

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,720
inspired me but I didn't start mapping

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,200
immediately because I was like curious

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,880
how that could influence people's life

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,430
is it actual it's actually a good thing

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,700
to do was not a good thing to do

00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,260
so I studied social sciences and I was

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,930
interested in the whole participatory

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:24,110
processes and citizens doing putting

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:26,720
their own yeah houses on the map and so

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,760
on and I started questioning this like

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,680
why would you do this in Islam is this

00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,390
actually good this is not good and then

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,720
I had the opportunity to go from my

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,310
studies to Bangladesh and I had the

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,650
chance to do a little research for my

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,840
masters in in one of the slums of

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,690
Bangladesh where I basically asked this

00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:48,200
question I showed a map and I asked this

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:52,550
question to the people and and they

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:55,670
basically got me convinced ya if ya

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,390
mapping is nice good and we want to do

00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,190
it ourselves

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,430
and so as from them I started to become

00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,930
more involved in the humanitarian

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:05,570
mapping and trying to reach out to local

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:08,090
people to map and and to put their own

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:11,060
places on the map basically so that's

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,670
how I kind of end up here in a more

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,100
humanitarian role which is different and

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:19,340
sometimes challenging but it's a it's

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:24,830
challenging and it's also nice that's my

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:29,300
story and yes so yeah when and how did

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,780
you find out about Adam Street now for

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,320
me

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:35,840
it's it will be more interesting when I

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:43,420
rather say that I was not it was back in

00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:46,270
2015 early 2015 I was supposed to help

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,650
Eureka and Pitt over there in Bangladesh

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:56,740
with some translation and logistic

00:10:48,650 --> 00:11:00,530
support as I had been working with MSF

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:04,070
over there in Bangladesh - apparently

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:07,730
from myself I got to know that two

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:11,570
people are coming from London I myself

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:18,020
and they are trying to map some part of

00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:22,880
the area in our city so I might need to

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:26,980
support them in a way so afterwards when

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:30,770
the any they came up and showed up and

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:34,790
having him mapathon being my personal

00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:38,720
training been designed for them in a

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:40,750
university I found out that I I would be

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,650
more interested in mapping rather than

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:48,590
translating the whole thing up and

00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:51,530
supporting them in that way and both it

00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:55,640
was one of the one of the mentioned I

00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:59,810
can remember sale your waiter was saying

00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:06,590
he is a lot more than a good map and

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:11,060
translated it it was then I got involved

00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:13,910
in the process and later on what

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,630
happened my involvement with osm is more

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:20,660
of a mixed journey I would rather say I

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:23,690
have been involved in the humanitarian

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:27,800
part of the mapping and at the same time

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:29,540
I have been working with some of the

00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:34,150
ride-sharing companies over there

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:39,260
supporting them with navigational stuffs

00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:41,810
so no more more of the more of my

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,850
efforts are going with the humanitarian

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,990
part and community building I would

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:50,660
rather say because right now later on I

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,820
have been trying to put in the community

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,960
and community has been working a bit

00:12:52,820 --> 00:13:00,800
well right now we do have community

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:03,830
becaming organizations we have one of

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:09,350
this foundation being recognized over

00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:13,910
there so this is more of the story right

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:18,260
now and on the humanitarian ground very

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:21,980
recent been involved with hot boat too

00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,440
so it has given me more opportunity to

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,470
work together in the global scale I

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,510
would rather say interesting so if some

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,210
very different ways you found out about

00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:35,390
opens Lima you've got kind of Kristen

00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:38,150
bold with seeing things on a map Dermott

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,760
kind of you have the idea but you waited

00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,380
for someone else to do it

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,980
your et who your boyfriend told you

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:48,320
about here and shoot you yeah kind of

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,230
there was a job completely bit unrelated

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:56,750
but then nothing's awesome so you got

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:59,390
involved yeah so I think there's lots

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,980
places we mapped I kind of I did think

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,840
about using the computers but we're not

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,290
gonna touch your computer and we're

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,400
gonna imagine if I could look at

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,820
openstreetmap I'm right now in search

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:14,110
for a place and we can change the map

00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:17,120
layer the style if you like in your mind

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:20,240
so you all all have to imagine this or

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,880
look it up I want you to tell me where

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,610
would you go to that you're proud of the

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,610
map and then explain why

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:40,570
I would rather say having right now we

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:42,610
with last two years ago we we have been

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:47,380
me and my team over there in Bangladesh

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:52,180
has put in something like nothing out

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:54,880
there to almost cover up 30% of the

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,810
whole country in a way this is one of

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:02,320
the things I feel proud of even even

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:06,280
when I see the community and the team

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,670
has been contributing in a bigger

00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:15,370
picture in global scale say I have been

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:18,310
saying it a lot in a way probably twenty

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:21,660
guys from Bangladesh community is right

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:24,400
now in the top fifty contributors in

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:28,210
global missing maps and humanitarian

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:33,810
OpenStreetMap leader board out there so

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:37,150
it has been it has been my proud part to

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:43,620
encourage this amount of contribution in

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:46,050
a way and having my country's coverage

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,860
improving their by day in a way because

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:54,210
where I'm coming from it is more of a

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:57,210
there has been a lot of disasters both

00:15:54,210 --> 00:16:02,100
because of the climate change and also

00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:04,330
man-made I would rather say and also

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,810
recently what we have done we have tried

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:11,200
to cover up the whole haka city in terms

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:13,150
of road networks and stuffs so that is

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,440
one of the things I'm very much proud of

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:22,600
I would be more proud of the whole thing

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:29,610
I would say the data we can contribute

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:32,700
in of overall need of

00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:35,820
data over there in terms of my country

00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:39,030
itself okay so very much kind of a

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,730
high-level view of your country and

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:44,520
stuff and maybe going back to Chris and

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,790
what you said about when I just Chris

00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,280
said earlier about he's encouraged and

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,050
helped other matters and so you kind of

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,210
count those that your contributions a

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,430
bit then you thought you were T where

00:16:54,210 --> 00:17:00,560
would you take us to how much would you

00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:04,830
say min on the map I would take you to

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,589
bangy the the capital of the Central

00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:10,100
African Republic look at that

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:15,510
it's the the the heart of Africa

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:18,510
basically Bunge that when when I saw was

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:24,450
the first time in Africa to go there in

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:26,670
2012 was there on with a little group of

00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:30,530
volunteers so basically on a mapping

00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:32,850
mission to try to outreach to

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,710
organizations to learn them about

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,800
OpenStreetMap because nobody in the

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:40,560
humanitarian world almost knew about

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,660
OpenStreetMap back then and so Punkie

00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:46,410
there was nothing that were just through

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,000
three four main axes of the city and

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,580
there was nothing and we basically just

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,920
started mapping mapping mapping so

00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,270
remote like remote and also take a

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,820
collection on the ground and we started

00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,610
mapping mapping mapping and like in in

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,380
two three months there were yeah there

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,390
was there was a decent map of the

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,810
country and one sect which is also

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,790
really nice so of course on Google Maps

00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,670
there was also nothing and I don't think

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,580
there are still a lot but also the the

00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,620
border on Google Maps from the

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:20,280
Democratic Republic of Congo was running

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,290
right through right through the true

00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,900
bangy the city so was right running

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,000
through the capital of another country

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,310
and I still suspect Google from seeing

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,780
our activity on OpenStreetMap that they

00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,850
so like oh there are so much going on

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,010
that I switched like a month later to

00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,190
boundary to the correct to the correct

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,580
side of the river

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,080
this inspection but I still think no I'm

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,789
honestly I'm proud of this like we

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,429
basically put the whole city on the map

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:50,059
the capital of a country which is just

00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:51,950
amazing and it also got used by a lot of

00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:54,409
humanitarian actors right afterwards

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,419
because I was then basically two months

00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:59,869
later that was a the war basically

00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:03,229
started and genocide basically started

00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:05,779
of people and it was just immediate

00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:07,820
action of humanitarian action seeing

00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:09,289
from okay where is the state and then

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,090
they started calling us the humanitarian

00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:13,879
organizations very sick data how can we

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,979
use this and which just yes still proud

00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:17,989
of I hope this contributes a little bit

00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:24,019
so that people who have been living

00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:26,479
there so yeah so look it up so I'm gonna

00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:29,059
bring it a lot closer to home these are

00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:31,609
not closer to my home so in the north

00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:34,070
west of Ireland is a county called

00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:37,399
Donegal it's the second largest county

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,169
in Ireland and one of the more I would

00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:41,419
say real good desolate sparsely

00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:43,580
populated it's very very beautiful well

00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:45,559
worth the visit um but the reason I

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,539
mentioned it is because I suppose the

00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,049
big motivation in the early days of

00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:53,929
OpenStreetMap was with in a world where

00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:56,269
we didn't actually have good imagery

00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:57,950
except in isolated pockets of the

00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:01,539
country and usually those were ones that

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:04,070
were close to major towns and cities it

00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:07,580
often took a long time before you could

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:11,029
get any kind of a backbone for the data

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,320
in in particular areas and you again in

00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:14,149
the early days of Ireland the biggest

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,729
challenge was the road network so the

00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:19,580
major road network and completing it so

00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:21,470
it was in a particular spot sort of in

00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,029
the middle of the northwest of Donegal

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,950
which itself is in the northwest of the

00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:27,259
country that I think the last piece of

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,330
the National Road network came into

00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:31,639
place and I mean I'll talk a little bit

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,979
about how it actually came to that point

00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:35,389
because again when you didn't have the

00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:37,249
imagery it wasn't a matter of waiting

00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:39,229
until somebody has the time to go and

00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:40,460
trace that particular piece because

00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:43,369
actually that will happen relatively

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,070
quickly because I'm as we saw so when

00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:48,080
being for instance released there

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,800
basically all of Western Europe

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,660
at a level that you could actually trace

00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,580
there was a huge upsurge in very quickly

00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,410
lots and lots of infill happened in

00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,660
Ireland and not all of that was even

00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:02,330
done by local Irish mappers but it was

00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,010
done in many cases by mappers from in

00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,840
many cases Germany because Germany had

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,120
been ahead of the curve in terms of

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,860
doing ground truth mapping at home so a

00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,330
lot of German mappers they had a very

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,530
useful profile on the one hand they've

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,120
become bored at home because it was

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,380
nothing left to map and on the other

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,180
hand many of them had enjoyed their

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,270
trips to Ireland so they were motivated

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:24,050
to help us out so thanks guys danke nuns

00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:25,850
um but basically at that time if you

00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,200
didn't have the imagery and if it wasn't

00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,790
a place that you'd actually had a chance

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,310
to visit yourself with your GPS device

00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:33,590
basically wantyou it was a waiting game

00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,330
to see if somebody somewhere would have

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,490
driven the route with the GPS device

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,560
would have uploaded the tracked log

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:42,230
because there are many people who had

00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,670
GPS devices wanted to help the map you

00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,410
have to upload a tracked log but were

00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,090
intimidated from actually mapping them

00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,560
themselves and actually I think there's

00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,600
still a little bit of that only these

00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,010
days not so much is done via tracked

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,530
logs anymore because usually we have

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,330
better sources so I remember still I

00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,160
can't remember exactly when it was the

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,590
Edit history would show us if we cared

00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,540
enough and I remember I would casually

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,010
you know in those areas in the National

00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,900
Road network when I where I knew he had

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,790
caps from time to time I would look to

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,460
see if someone had uploaded a GPX trace

00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:12,650
and one day I went in and there it was

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,480
the missing piece so you know an hour

00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,560
later the National Road network was

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,380
complete and we did it we had a great

00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,970
sense of achievement still if you zoomed

00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,250
in on the map at that place it still

00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,290
looked hugely empty and on adventurous

00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,670
by today's standards what you have to

00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,580
understand is if you think about a

00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,780
mapper who is in that general vicinity

00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,400
the piece where they would be able to

00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,320
say here's my town or village and

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,030
there's nothing there and not even a

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,940
role that shows how you can get close to

00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:40,040
it that's very different to say ok I see

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,250
there is a map that comes near me I can

00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,930
extend that and to my village and you

00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,460
know so really the you know the map

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,020
gained an awful lot of momentum through

00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,460
through actions like that so I was very

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,830
very pleased and proud at that moment

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,200
they're taking away to someone else to

00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:56,150
do the work or but then you continuing

00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,100
it so it's it's this collaboration isn't

00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,600
it I will say that it's not that I was

00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,920
sitting at home waiting for for everyone

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,020
else to do the GPX tracks

00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,610
tract lava there's a reason why it was

00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,200
up the furthest extremity from where I

00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,670
actually live because I did actually

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,590
haven't drive an awful lot of bases

00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:14,840
myself in order to do this kind of in

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:18,650
the field yeah probably my hometown

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,660
which is Edinburgh when I started it was

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,820
just a blank sheet there was maybe two

00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,490
roads that wasn't even a name node for

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,200
the city and their kind I think at that

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,760
point I didn't have a GPS yet but there

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,560
was a couple of traces so you kind of

00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,270
trying to work out well I think that

00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,330
line there and that line there is

00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,620
probably that road and I kind of just

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,540
started building the city grid from

00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,710
there I've got to reach the point where

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,900
I suddenly realized that the first

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,360
object a guy map which was around about

00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,010
in Edinburgh is about to get is getting

00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,660
completely redeveloped I know that was

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,640
my first thing about the stream but it's

00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,050
not going to be there anymore and we've

00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,630
kind of gone from there to just adding

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,890
more and more from being ambitious about

00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,720
we just want the street names and

00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,400
that'll do and then we'll okay we've got

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,410
the street name so I learned starting

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,790
buildings and addresses and all the

00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:05,120
shops and all the pubs and all the bars

00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,560
and you know everything and it's kind of

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,690
it's interesting to see that journey and

00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,910
actually I think it it kind of hopefully

00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,890
in the way that we were inspired by

00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,350
other cities and the detail that they

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,180
had hopefully the detail that we have

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:20,210
will also inspire other people to see

00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,220
what's possible so that's me so thank

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:25,580
you we've had some great conversations

00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:28,100
there and very different stories I mean

00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,900
even different parts of your stories you

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,240
do different things different things

00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,250
since borrow arsenic kind of it's just a

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,130
small looked into the Oakland Sigma

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,690
community so if you don't know many

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,340
people at the conference you can now

00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,380
come and talk to these people because

00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,420
you know some of their stories you can

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,790
ask them more about what they did or

00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:50,210
what they're doing but also hopefully it

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:53,660
helps you know how diverse are our

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:55,070
interests are and our involvement and it

00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,320
might inspire you to talk to other

00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,850
people and I saw the question and thanks

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,110
you very much guys for coming especially

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,000
at short notice

00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:04,210
and I hope you enjoy the rest of the

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,210
conference

00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:07,370
