Title: 2019: Is your OSM App spying on you?
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	OpenStreetMap enables people to use third-party apps that seem to be more suitable for privacy-conscientious users, but are we as users really private when using OSM-based apps?

In mobile applications users generally don’t have control over what gets transmitted over the network. This means that people even in the age of the GDPR are not aware what they expose about themselves when using Android or iOS apps. This talks goes through a few popular open and closed source OSM apps and shows what gets transmitted about you and to whom. Additionally, it shows whether removing ads through in-app purchase gives users of those apps more privacy. Furthermore it will be demonstrated which tracking services are most often used and which risks of de-anonymization could arise from this. Also a brief discussion whether and how software developers can make their software more privacy-friendly will take place.

Are users aware which data gets sent to third parties and are they consenting? Do they have a choice? And is this tracking generally bad or can it improve user experience in return? Are there apps which are suitable for people who want to stay private? Is it possible to prevent tracking and how?
This talk is going to compare several OSM apps in regards to their privacy levels, but also show how closed data, commercial competitors are performing.

	00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:12,490
everybody welcome and even going to hell

00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:16,630
the last session before lunch by thomas

00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:19,750
cover it and it's going to be is your OS

00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:27,820
m ab spying on you so yeah i have to

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:30,789
find out thank you yeah before I start

00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,910
doing my talk about privacy and all

00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:37,329
those ugly things I want to do a few

00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,489
disclaimers first of all I'm not a

00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,350
professional security research I just

00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:45,129
know some tooling and I'm generally

00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:48,489
carry yes and I don't even care myself

00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:50,079
that much but I like it when products

00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:53,499
are made that way that are privacy

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,409
preserving and I'm also not saying that

00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:58,719
all the things I will show here are bad

00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:00,159
or you shouldn't do it but just think

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,670
about what you're doing when you're

00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,940
developing an app with OpenStreetMap and

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,190
[Music]

00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:13,240
the thing is when we go along and we say

00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:15,280
oh we're from OpenStreetMap there's like

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,220
always like a sentiment at all with

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,280
something positive and people are using

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,980
open street because they have a like

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,600
maybe this thing yeah I love using it

00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,950
because I don't want to give my data

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,690
away to Google app or I don't trust more

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,850
yeah it's great to support a free

00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,160
project something like that and they

00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,800
generally have some expectations that we

00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,900
have a bread identity and we have this

00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,620
thing and when people use open street

00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:47,320
based apps they think okay those are

00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,030
especially privacy-preserving or there

00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,740
because they develop a community or

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,470
something like that people have positive

00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,810
associations of positive attitude but

00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,120
the thing is we as open statement we do

00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,780
not control the whole staff yeah so if

00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:04,660
you have some application out there yes

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,550
we give the data as a project but what

00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,240
you do with the data that is up to the

00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:12,160
developer of the application and using

00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,000
OpenStreetMap yeah what what does this

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,800
even mean

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,950
does it mean that you use the data or

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,840
they doesn't mean that you use the

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,370
OpenStreetMap

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,100
project or something that is hosted by

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,410
OpenStreetMap and even if you just use

00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:30,730
Open Street Map torque which is like the

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:34,870
plain vanilla case that we control as

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:37,090
the Open Street Map community this also

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,700
leaves a trail of data yeah if you look

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,830
at it if you generally use Open Street

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,170
Map rhetoric you will use a variety of

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:48,090
different services yeah you will use the

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:52,420
search you will use maybe the routing

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,459
you will use the tile service and so on

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,650
and so on and they would also controlled

00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:58,660
by very different entities so for

00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,830
example the website itself no me not him

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,660
and the analytics tool it's called now

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:09,010
called mimoto button domain is the

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:11,350
peewee those are hosted by OS MF the

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,209
router for example is hosted by Foss yes

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,370
which is the German local chapter of

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,290
Open Street Map but if you use for

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,000
example Donata or SRM routing routing

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,090
requests will go to graphical table

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,470
which is a for-profit company with an

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:28,269
involvement in OS m and if you look for

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,269
example that the user accounts on OS

00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:34,120
some websites you will use a Gravatar

00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:37,530
which is a us-based company with no

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,540
involvement no time at all and

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,150
if you click for example on the locate

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,820
me button this will transfer some data

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,240
to go through your operating system when

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,370
you will use the the operating system

00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,520
functions to locate yourself this will

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,900
also leave a trail of data and you might

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,340
say yeah okay I'm leaving a trail of

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,590
data but it's not that bad

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,420
we now have gdpr and there are no

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,459
privacy policies and they're fantastic

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,390
we can look at what what actually

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:09,030
happens and let's do what basically no

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,630
one maybe except Simon does let's have a

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:16,590
look at privacy policies and the reality

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:19,070
is they're all very different and

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,019
they're very very new degrees of private

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,630
I'm not going to tell which one is from

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:30,270
which service but they're basically all

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:33,990
related to using OSM levorg one is IP

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,790
addresses are stored sorry IP addresses

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,500
thought are shortened to two bytes and

00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:42,419
details users information is retained

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:45,180
from 180 days ok every API requests the

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,520
stored we say The Associated Information

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:52,770
request body and Hannah's IP and time

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,380
for a maximum of five weeks ok and from

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,150
another we collect information that web

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,300
browsers mobile devices and servers

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,030
typically make available such as browser

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,729
type IP address unique David I've

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,190
devised identifiers language preference

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:10,320
refer inside the date and time of access

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,570
operating system and mobile network

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,790
information ok stuffy in private and

00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:20,070
there is even one one bonus also not

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,510
saying from from Marsellus please do not

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,010
submit personal data or also

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:27,650
confidential material to any of our

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,650
services right

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:38,870
and normally European privacy regulation

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,689
requires you to tell in your privacy

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:45,650
statement why certain data is saved and

00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:48,550
processed not even how but why and some

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,800
third parties don't really do it and

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,020
others are a bit vague and saying he had

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,300
to identify miss usage and improve

00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:01,280
performance and usability this is German

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:03,770
general terminology here yes some of

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,580
those privacy policies or the makers of

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,990
those privacy policies make an effort to

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,000
detail what third-party providers they

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,599
use themselves because generally when

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,219
you operate a service you might have

00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:18,919
some service that you use for building

00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:21,229
or for I don't know like aggregation of

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,060
a hosting a database or whatever but

00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:24,949
doesn't always work sometimes if you

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,669
take out a link it's just paged opt-out

00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:31,129
yeah so this really happens okay so now

00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:33,590
we went through ok you leave a trail of

00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:35,240
data and yeah you maybe leave some data

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,909
with party provides but maybe let's just

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,810
first do a a risk assessment yeah is

00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:45,080
there any risk in using those tools and

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,699
the truth is yes your location date and

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,469
it's not only your calendar current

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,560
location but you also leave a trail of

00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:54,110
your usual locations that you spend some

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,300
time and if you look at lock data of

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,520
course this just looks like you know is

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,589
that it basically you would say oh

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,520
what's what's the bad thing and this I

00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:07,479
don't see a pattern but well machines do

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,520
see a pattern and if you label it and

00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:13,069
visualize it suddenly parents will

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,879
emerge and there could be reconstructed

00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:19,310
to trail of your activity anyway I say

00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,909
yeah but who makes such an effort yeah

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,620
and sure people that are operating the

00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,110
course of infrastructure are not

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,879
interested in doing that because they

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,980
have much better things to do keeping

00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,200
the platform running and

00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,880
stable and yet they don't have an

00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,550
incentive to collect that they have

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,350
throw it away and yeah maybe if someone

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,600
is misusing the data they will see your

00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:45,100
hair it's from that IP address block and

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,080
who hunts you down just basically block

00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,500
but they won't do probably anything with

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,480
the data but there are companies

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,230
focusing on selling ads and so sunny

00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,810
locations that based ads and if you look

00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,640
at that I mean the positive thing about

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:05,000
that slightest they got the attribution

00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,430
kind of correct halfway through but

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,290
basically you can you can do ads and

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,930
it's not only for people who are

00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,450
currently in a location but you can sell

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,940
people to you could say ads to people

00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,010
who are sometimes of that location who

00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,500
live there who are currently traveling

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:24,410
so basically this service that this year

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,470
selling ad services knows okay you're

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,670
not native in this location you're just

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:35,180
temporarily here you're traveling the

00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:37,880
air and this is one aspect but you

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,010
people say okay I use an OS a map the

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,220
third-party app that even works offline

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,780
so I'm good right because then nothing

00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,250
could happen I'm downloading the the

00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,800
data in front it's not like Google Maps

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,810
where they have to be online to to zoom

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,590
in the map and so on so everything

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,450
should be fine right

00:08:51,590 --> 00:09:01,490
okay so let's fire up one very popular

00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:04,040
osm based app and it's fixed to some

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,660
browsing yeah let's look around maybe

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,570
there is all this Italian restaurant

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,960
nearby there's maybe the train station

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:13,730
oh I want to go to the mosque yeah you

00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,130
see a little at the bottom yeah

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,720
everything is fine right and now let's

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,720
let's look behind the curtains and

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,939
look okay what is the app actually doing

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,170
and I fired up a tool that intercepts

00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:30,240
the traffic and it's basically yet there

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,670
is some communication going on obviously

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,560
a you see some requests in more pop you

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,649
see some requests the crashlytics to

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,959
Facebook absolute calm okay

00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:41,759
something is apparently going on even

00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:46,709
though I downloaded all the map data

00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:49,199
before actually starting there so let's

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,180
let's dive a little bit deeper and look

00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:52,589
what is transmitted all of this is at

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,699
the time of writing of course apps

00:09:52,589 --> 00:10:01,139
change like with time but yeah that was

00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:03,449
when it last checked and this is the

00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:06,750
thing what max of me is sending to

00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:08,430
Facebook and yeah it looks like tons of

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:12,300
data and there's a few interesting bits

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:15,350
for example they're sending the model of

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,600
my phone okay fair enough

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,490
also do width of my screen for whatever

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,209
reason Facebook apparently needs to know

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:27,649
how wide my screen is and Facebook also

00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:32,819
knows how out the volume of my phone is

00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:39,209
with like 0.2177 4 to 4 for whatever

00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:41,850
Fassett there's also other data sent out

00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:45,569
for example to I think this is to mop up

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:49,769
this is there was sent like some some

00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:52,050
stuff out yeah perfectly I'm on the

00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:54,870
mobile network Vodafone in the country

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,810
262 which stands for Germany and all too

00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,660
is

00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:01,000
of 0-2 is the German mobile phone

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,210
operator Vodafone again yeah so they

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,490
will send this out as well but because

00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:11,380
even deeper if you tap on certain things

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:14,020
so yeah you tap on some hotel there it

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,500
will also emit some request self yeah

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:20,230
again I've pre download all the data in

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,950
offline mode and so on but still this

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:27,720
will during runtime of the app send out

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:31,450
requests and in that case booking.com

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,940
there's a payload of data and for

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,620
example there's the whole hotel ID that

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,630
I tapped on apparently this is already

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,970
linked in the maps in the app so

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,120
booking.com will now also know where I

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,120
am

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:49,330
yes some some more requests going out

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:53,170
maybe this is not that critical because

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:55,210
it it doesn't show like the exact

00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,150
location I'm currently in but it will

00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:00,370
send out in which region I am so you see

00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,850
okay apparently they're asking from

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,860
their ad network to get local ads in

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:10,210
Cologne where I was at the time of

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:13,210
writing and you might say yeah okay so

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:17,050
but there's the settings menu and you

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:18,910
can configure things but all the things

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,530
I've shown you with all the requests

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,510
going out all the data that is going out

00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:26,200
this was with the toggle sense

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:30,040
statistics set to OFF so actually I told

00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:33,640
the app to not do it and it just ignored

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,980
it you can also tap the show office

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,810
button off which is basically offices

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:43,050
like in nicer word for

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:45,610
attachment and then you get like this

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,110
sweet dog that will tell you okay if you

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:53,140
want some more privacy please pay us

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:55,390
some money yeah and yeah I said let's

00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,339
try it out I will just turn off that

00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:01,360
feature pay them 99 cents for the week

00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:03,700
and did look a bit better afterwards but

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,890
not much better yeah it will still

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,560
connect to critics

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:10,600
career statistics office by Google which

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,640
tracks apps crashes so basically when

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,560
your app crashes this will tell the

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,750
developers or get it crashed because of

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,279
this and that and maybe those variables

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,940
were set and this current view was

00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:24,190
active and so on okay fair enough but my

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,690
app didn't crash it was running fine but

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:31,810
nonetheless it was connecting connecting

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:35,310
to critics for the critics data we can't

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:38,200
really inspect them because they're use

00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:41,140
HTTP spinning so I can't really look

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,940
into it it's yeah we would probably to

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,190
look into the SDKs what's actually

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,339
happening there but we can look at the

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:50,950
other stuff we can look at what is sent

00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:53,860
to more pop dot-com even without office

00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,570
so I already paid maps of me to not show

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,089
me those offers I disabled the

00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:01,450
statistics nonetheless they will send

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:03,940
our data to Ed at network yeah it's this

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:09,220
that's kind of fun

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:11,280
they tell the mop-up to track that I

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:15,150
don't want to be tracked

00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:20,260
yeah because DNC stands for do not strap

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:23,170
yeah crazy and spider said like some

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,450
stuff but they use some I don't know if

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:29,530
an encoding encryption I don't know what

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:33,040
happened what's happening there and this

00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:36,640
bonus this is this is the except from

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,920
the privacy policy of maps ugly or of

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,459
web stuff me order to be exact as might

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,139
calm and they say the legal base

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:46,980
for collecting my location business

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:50,689
consent okay if they mean to but I

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,790
didn't really consent at any point and

00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:56,100
just one thing maybe someone from maps

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,079
of me is listening it is nice that

00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,410
you're giving people the option to opt

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,209
out of all the statistics things but it

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,740
would be nice if it actually worked

00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:07,619
they are you messing here with the

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,319
reputation of OSF you are using OS and

00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:13,110
things we are recommending your app to

00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:16,980
friends and family and we didn't know

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:20,490
that because you didn't tell us and

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,079
maybe we can look at some more positive

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,589
examples maybe there are apps we're

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:28,800
doing better so let's look at some end

00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:33,319
on iOS and the good news is it is

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:36,209
generally less chatty so as long as you

00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:38,610
disable online tiles it will not

00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:41,249
communicate to the outside world well

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,569
unless you tap on someplace it will

00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:44,519
actually call home

00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:46,470
yeah it doesn't hold to some third-party

00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,009
providers like Facebook or whatever but

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:52,519
it will go to its own domain and

00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:57,179
retrieve some data to me it looks like

00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:59,069
this is done in good intent because osm

00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:02,730
aunt has the option to show metal aerial

00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:04,679
pictures in the app but they don't want

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,660
to expose you to mapillary so you don't

00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:08,730
do like the directly request to metal I

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,889
remember Larry could track you but

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,730
instead they are very deeply proxying

00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:17,369
the things but I think there is some

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,499
some miscommunication that because

00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:21,480
mapillary was actually disabled at the

00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:23,369
time of checking so probably there is

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,889
some bug that they're fetching the data

00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:27,660
without even needing it and by the way

00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:32,220
Ellis I meant I should update your nginx

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:35,040
it's really old there's one positive

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,950
example one app that I use this also as

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,230
I'm based it's Guru Maps

00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,360
yeah we can browse around for a little

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,910
bit through the app there's privacy

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,440
settings in there you can they have

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,390
three different settings for app

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,029
analytics for credit and for navigation

00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,850
so you can basically say okay I want to

00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:57,600
help you having a better navigation

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:59,550
system and find problems in routing but

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,630
I don't want to send crash data and

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:06,240
analytics data the positive thing is it

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,500
does actually work because the with the

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,240
whole browsing it didn't send out any

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:15,510
requests at all not not a single signal

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,790
okay so what do we learn unfortunately

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:20,939
not every app that is osm base is a

00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,620
private app and unfortunately not even

00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,730
open source software is guaranteed to be

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:28,950
from because much me is a source and

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:31,290
developers please respect the need for

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,660
privacy don't collect everything upfront

00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,460
okay if you have a crash okay that might

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,580
be a legitimate reason to collect the

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,380
data at that moment but don't connect

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,559
every time to a third-party service

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,100
don't send things out about us

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:49,440
and ask users for consent because you

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,240
can ask the user say okay do you want to

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,360
participate in this improvement system

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,429
Intel about what you're actually doing I

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,870
know all the UX people you hate it when

00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:59,610
you have an onboarding process in the

00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,370
app but it's really important as you've

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,230
seen you can browse for really private

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,120
things that you don't want to talk about

00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,059
or you don't want it exposed to some

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,340
third party services yeah that's

00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:14,070
important as a user tab you can have a

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:17,660
choice and there's a developer please

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:20,130
use the system as systems api's for

00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,929
privacy settings so for example in iOS

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,560
you have the IEA's

00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:25,120
identifier manager and you

00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,950
and check for the is advertising

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,590
tracking tracking enabled setting yeah

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,900
so there you can see okay you can you

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,480
can get consent without having a screen

00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,280
so if if a user has advertising tracking

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,090
enabled then you don't have to ask but

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,560
if it's disabled Prospectus and don't

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,260
include third-party frameworks blindly

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,990
because that's the thing that we often

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,240
see a lot of developers are including

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:51,400
for example Facebook SDK and Facebook

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,400
SDK is always doing some requests and

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,500
it's always having some some stuff going

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,780
on please really think about it even

00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,170
including may compromise the privacy of

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:05,430
the user okay that's all for me and I'm

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,430
really looking forward to questions

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,710
thanks Thomas with an interesting and

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:28,640
informative talk and now we will have

00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:28,640
five minutes for questions comments okay

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,060
[Music]

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,690
did you look at the Android versions as

00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:53,909
well sorry speak up

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:58,620
did you look at the Android versions as

00:19:53,909 --> 00:20:03,240
well enjoy it fallin so sorry I I

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:05,400
couldn't check I assumed that it should

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,950
be very similar because it's widely the

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,880
same code base with OS m and it's

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:15,120
different because I don't think they do

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:19,500
share code bases so your mileage may

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:22,460
vary I recently discovered that there's

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,929
an app on earth droid called Maps and

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,570
apparently it's some kind of form of a

00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:31,169
map see and I was wondering if yeah

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:34,740
that's for what do all this dragon yeah

00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:39,480
I mean this is the thing that if source

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:41,490
code analysis is not really 100% safe

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,100
because you don't actually know what you

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:46,650
got shipped on your phone with with

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:49,860
Google Play and so on you don't have

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:54,090
that much of control to check what is

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,919
delivers so I mean sure maybe the apps

00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,530
have some mechanisms to see okay they're

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,960
currently behind a proxy so probably

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,419
someone is analyzing it but runtime

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,370
analysis is safer because you see okay

00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,559
what is actually happening what data is

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,450
actually being sent out okay so with

00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,789
things like crashlytics where I couldn't

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:14,580
look into the data I don't know what's

00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:16,080
actually happening I mean that's the

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,870
thing we don't know maybe they're even

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,440
transferring the location data we can't

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:24,179
tell it because yeah it's it's really

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,650
difficult to tell what software you're

00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:28,620
running in the end that's there is

00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:31,100
always some kind of trust involved in

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,100
that whole process

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,790
okay looks like everybody's satisfied

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:51,110
but I guess you have a green pencil

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:52,730
we're buying those questions coming okay

00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,940
if nobody else must ask questions you

00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:59,870
know jump into the breach

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:02,140
just one remark that IVC noticed from

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:05,270
maps me is actually nonsense you can't

00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:08,840
for the same thing have consent and

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:12,110
legitimate interest as as the reason for

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,669
doing things it does it's not meaningful

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:17,870
what they are they're actually writing

00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:22,570
their the other thing is stepping back

00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:25,190
from from actual apps on mobile devices

00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:28,630
there are a couple of ways where we're

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:31,400
leaking privacy related the information

00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:34,549
without people really being aware of it

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,059
so assume you start up IT and you're

00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:41,780
looking at an immature layer from pain

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:43,549
you are actually transferring the air

00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,160
that you're looking at because they know

00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:48,559
which times you are lying at to them and

00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:51,530
that's one of the things which we don't

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:55,760
really point out to people at this point

00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:58,549
in time and so it's less nobody's really

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,809
interested in you know treatment when

00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:01,490
you're looking at openstreetmap tires

00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,000
but actually we're going out to third

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:08,000
parties with all the other layers and

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,270
that's a issue on mobile devices as well

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,270
naturally

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:23,860
if we have a moment in a more general

00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:27,610
level um I feel that the privacy editors

00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:30,429
is pretty burly protected inoue-san my

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,740
own history is kind of revealing if I

00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:34,809
look I know where I've been in every

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,450
vacation and everybody will know it

00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:47,230
he's our any plan to tackle this big

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:50,580
problem I think about privacy because I

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,720
mean okay with purpose privacy sure you

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,340
probably you leave a trail of data as

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,929
well but at least you can choose because

00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:00,909
you decide on that but I think maybe

00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:02,499
yeah because doesn't really have

00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:07,450
something directly to do with the talk

00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:12,610
but last year we did our privacy policy

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:15,070
for the OSM F and we had a long list of

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:19,840
stuff that we need to change the bttv

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:23,529
are compatible and some of that has been

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,720
done for example people that sign up now

00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:28,869
actually have to agree to Terms of Use

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,759
which have privacy respect

00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:32,649
causes in them so you know allowed to

00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:36,129
stalk people not allowed to extract the

00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:40,299
data for purposes that will violate

00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:43,629
somebody's privacy and our plan changes

00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:45,850
to the API so that people that are not

00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:48,249
logged in don't have an Open Street Map

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:51,490
account will not be able to access stuff

00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:53,049
like the username and similar of of

00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,610
changes so you actually have to be

00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:59,769
logged in how her OpenStreetMap account

00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:02,919
so that can access this data and similar

00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:05,529
changes will be coming with the planet

00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,929
and so with the raw data so that there

00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:09,700
will be as some of this has been

00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:12,730
implemented for example to your fabric

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,330
or it does this you you can get extract

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,460
which includes

00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,149
user names and xmax which don't include

00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,490
them that this is a big work-in-progress

00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:25,159
the the main hurdle right now is that

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:27,350
one's not founder developer a page

00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,960
developer I should point out to

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:34,549
implement these changes on the API but

00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,500
they're just working and if you want to

00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:42,620
I can point you to the documents and all

00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:47,059
the stuff that's going on no because the

00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:49,690
problem with those are are that we do

00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:52,779
actually want to know who edited for

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:59,179
reasons of vandalism protection and

00:25:52,779 --> 00:26:02,510
copyright issues so will we will try not

00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:06,740
to spy on people but we do want to have

00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:10,580
a direct link between the edits and a

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:13,309
certain person so that we can go back

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:17,330
them ask them from where did where where

00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:19,190
did you get this data from but the

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,080
information that we collect is limited

00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,029
but you are complete correct you know

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,510
there's lots of stuff that you can read

00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:28,760
out of the Edit history of someone and

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,549
there's there's a longest paper which is

00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,830
mainly from me which burns which goes

00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:37,330
into great detail probably including

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,330
some stuff that you didn't even know

00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:49,649
thanks for mas thanks everybody for

00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,179
attending and enjoy your lunch

00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:54,010
if you have further questions you can

00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:56,710
talk to the master

00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:59,859
[Applause]
