Title: 2019: Collaborative cartography of cycling infrastructure for route and thematic maps in Medellin, C
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	The project created from the cooperation between GeoLab (Universidad de Antioquia), and SiCLas (group of cyclists), both present in Aburrá Valley (Colombia), proposes a collaborative mapping by bicycle users as an urban transport mode. The data generation from existing cycling infrastructure will allow an improvement of OSM database, and an optimization in route calculation. In addition, the incorporation of surveys will allow the generation of thematic maps, such as the association of gender with mobility.

The cities of the Aburrá Valley, with Medellín as a core city, present a network of bike paths, and the theme of sustainable and non-motorized mobility is gaining increasing importance in public policies in the region. Meanwhile, everyday cyclists, who use the bicycle on a daily basis as a mode of transport, know that this cycling infrastructure has lacks in several aspects, such as a fragmented presence in the territory, non-direct routes, among others.
In addition, the cycling infrastructure in OpenStreetMap is not completely mapped or has erroneous information, this represents a problem for cyclists who wish to transport themselves through the city and identify the most appropriate route to their destination. It does not have accurate and relevant information for users such as the location of bicycle parking, bike-share stations and multimodal stations, among others. These reasons represent a disincentive for more people to choose the bicycle as a mode of transport.
For these reasons, this project aims to map the existing formal cycling infrastructure, urban transport routes used by cyclists, to optimize route calculation, and aims to create a platform that allows the visualization of safety data, infrastructure, environmental problems (air quality) and gender mobility, among others, in which the information of shared eventualities can be collected and uploaded by the users. 
From the cooperation created between the GeoLab research group of the University of Antioquia – YouthMappers chapter, and the SiClas group of cyclists, both entities present in the Aburrá Valley, a considerable number of cycling activists will be mapping the cities of the valley with the OSM platform and tools open. The discussion of the existing tags in OSM for the mapping of cycling infrastructures is a topic of interest in the project, and can contribute to a discussion of the creation of new tags in OSM. The status of current information will be verified and corrected and the missing routes mapped. The tools to generate the thematic maps will be KoBo Collect, Mappillary, among others.

welcome every body to the last talk in

00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:17,170
this session so I welcome Karolina

00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,840
Ortega Espinoza for the last talk she's

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,520
from MIDI in Colombia and we will hear

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,489
about how cycling maps are created and

00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,340
yeah okay thank you good afternoon

00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:34,110
everyone my name is Karolina

00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:36,160
so I from Colombia I am sorry

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,019
environmental engineer at the University

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:47,559
of Antioquia I am a part of humour perch

00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:51,429
after a that college a la jolla so this

00:00:47,559 --> 00:01:02,199
project is called is execution in a is

00:00:51,429 --> 00:01:06,090
expected to finish in 10 months magazine

00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:09,730
is located in Seoul America Colombia

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:17,920
typically has a serious problem with PM

00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:27,930
wheeshes particulate matter a 22.5 a

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:27,930
small one with the PMT PM PM 2.5 is a

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,690
it's a comes from

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,530
convolution from by calls because cars

00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:44,320
and buses motorcycles and trucks from

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:48,220
files and emission from power plants and

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,880
industrial facilities the the reason is

00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,620
the managing location is between in are

00:01:50,880 --> 00:02:02,480
can you not with mountain

00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:10,580
in the city other problem is they lacked

00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:12,680
a day they wrote a day by commence the

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,630
project is a cooperation between Jo

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,690
Larson live from Universidad de

00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:20,690
antioquia and c-class is a group of

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,780
cyclists but present in managing

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:28,570
proposed collaborative mapping by

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:37,340
bicycles user and human transfer mode

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:40,490
okay a story idea site wrote a in

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:44,780
managing the cycle route is not

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:47,300
completely map adore husband information

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,800
nature is securing or no relevant for

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:55,520
information available for users so such

00:02:51,800 --> 00:03:01,000
the location of the cycle routes cycle

00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:07,750
parking lot or Naumann others this is a

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:15,800
existing information so as you can see

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:22,100
in the in the gray this is uses to it in

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:24,680
blood is a juice existing by roads in

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:30,320
green is huge map with a puppet and

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:35,920
openness to map and the in general is

00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:43,850
the projective or metropolitan area in

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:46,070
imaging so all goes is mopping existing

00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,830
cycle infrastructure and alternative

00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:52,519
cycling roads using their bicycle as a

00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,270
mode transfer of you urban transferring

00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,400
manager

00:03:53,270 --> 00:04:00,460
documentation the rules and cymatics

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:03,850
maps and geospatial tools and open j a

00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:07,220
approach and the first one is

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,800
information collection your data

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,880
database information collection and

00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,010
remote mapping in OpenStreetMap a

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:21,530
formulation in the social special he

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:24,950
analysis surveys the second is gathering

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:29,540
of during the flight of a road and the

00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:32,660
forum three is the analysis of data

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,720
collected in the definition of geo

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:45,140
process to for the visualization of the

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:49,060
somatic maps as in this in this picture

00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:55,570
as you can see the existing information

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:59,770
is no completely in openness room up on

00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,770
our spectrum result

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,830
the desire of the spectral response from

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,860
this project

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:15,810
the first one is analysis of information

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,580
collected to characterize human cyclists

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:25,479
unidentified prefer routes in secure

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:28,120
areas among others and the second is the

00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,910
platform that I love the spatial

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,639
visualization and the possible routes of

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:39,610
mobile mobile refurb I keep my use

00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:43,560
unusal will be able to report security

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:46,870
attributes AF intimidation or

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,110
infrastructure like damage or basic

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:54,300
roots on environmental problems to a

00:05:50,110 --> 00:06:03,610
mobile even more frequented by Ria's on

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:05,650
cycle at the generation from existence

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,289
of infrastructure will allow an

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:11,800
improvement of open stream of data base

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:14,919
and of an optimization of rows

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,490
calculation for example distance or

00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:23,169
spirit in addiction incorporation of

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:26,139
service wheeler will allow to make smart

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:32,050
generations who saw the association of

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:38,169
of gender in the mobile and this is all

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:42,760
for the moment for more information you

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:45,490
can see there you can contact us in this

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:51,220
emails image as your lover well they are

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:56,590
dead calm calm she is you can

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:58,280
participate or or support or no thank

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,470
you

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,470
[Applause]

00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:11,379
so thanks a lot Karolina for your talk

00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:15,479
and now it's time for questions

00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:15,479
so anyone has question

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:41,440
hello my name is your him on one page I

00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:45,770
saw like a feedback - how how how can

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,560
the use of the cyclists the feedback do

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,620
you program Annette or like this I saw

00:07:48,560 --> 00:08:03,260
something like capo or something on one

00:07:51,620 --> 00:08:05,390
of your slides how do you get the

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:11,420
feedback how can the users get the

00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:15,500
feedback the capo collect the next yeah

00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:21,770
I I saw that the cable put called Bo

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:23,710
collect okay so but I I'm in tweet what

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:31,610
what is it over there

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:35,390
the on the last no no no one there

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:38,750
you'll see it's like sibling forum at it

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:45,500
says form this one this is the feedback

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:53,230
tool from the cyclists who vocollect

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:58,100
yeah yes in our group we

00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:04,000
we have been used coca-cola for other

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:08,740
projects so a we consider is a sound

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:15,589
good option for carry out this project

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:18,110
so collect information from communities

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:22,060
as cycling's community

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:24,250
yeah so it's a platform for feedback

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:29,350
collecting when collecting information

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:40,970
it's not for only for your project but

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:43,280
for other projects as well other more

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:46,089
question that's a question in the back

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,490
[Music]

00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:54,589
hi I'm Daniel I have a question

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:56,899
regarding the project in Bogota I think

00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:59,770
there's a every Sunday they close down a

00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:02,950
big part of the roads called signal via

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:05,950
do you have something similar in

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,950
Medellin

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:31,740
and in Bogota soon Prieto as it is see

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:33,210
Gloria en Don Domingo total loss vias of

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:40,260
you son

00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:46,040
no abierto para los coches yeah there

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:52,640
are some cyclopean cycle routes is no

00:10:46,040 --> 00:11:02,400
this is no good for its incomplete

00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:04,680
trains okay gracias thank you so thanks

00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,230
a lot Karolina for your talking in and

00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,609
