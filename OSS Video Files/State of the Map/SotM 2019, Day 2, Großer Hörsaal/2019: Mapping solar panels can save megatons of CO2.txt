Title: 2019: Mapping solar panels can save megatons of CO2
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	We are working to map all the solar panels (photovoltaic, "PV") in the world. Why? The data can be used directly to reduce carbon emissions from power generation. We will share our experiences of surveying, aerial mapping and machine vision to find all the hundreds of thousands of solar panels in our countries.

Together with a small group called OpenClimateFix, we are working to map all the solar panels (photovoltaic, "PV") in the world. Why? Because if we combine this with short-term forecasting of cloud and sunshine, we can directly predict the solar power electricity generation ahead of time. This means we don't need to burn as much coal or gas as backup. So, it can be valuable to know the exact location and characteristics of each solar PV installation - large solar farms, and small domestic installations.

In this talk we'll discuss how this all fits together. We'll talk about solar power tagging/mapping in OSM, for both large and small, to make it easy for people to map but also useful for the power network analysis. We'll also share our explorations of crowdsourcing and automation machine vision, and the use of other data sources such as government open data to guide the mapping process.

We have already mapped a significant portion of the UK's solar capacity, and trialled some crowdsourcing and machine vision tools. We will show visualisations and analyses of the work that's been done so far, and consider how to scale this worldwide.

good so welcome everybody now we have

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,360
torque from 10 Stovall and Jerry Clough

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,420
is involved as well but then will talk

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,150
to us about solar panels mapping solar

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:29,130
panels and how they can save megatons of

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:32,309
CO W let's see why thank you

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:38,519
okay so can you hear me okay seems like

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:42,380
it's okay good but good thank you yes so

00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:45,410
I am here talking about solar panels and

00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:50,010
I've been involved in OpenStreetMap for

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:52,050
almost ten years now in fact the last

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,140
time I was at the OpenStreetMap was

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,809
sorry state of the map event was in 2013

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,379
at the height of my addiction I'm

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,910
recovering now but the reason I'm back

00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:06,119
is specifically because of this thing

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,910
which was really new to me this year

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,670
essentially we would all like to do

00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,990
something about climate change and we

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,810
there are various things that

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,490
OpenStreetMap is good for but it's quite

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,900
novel to me that we can do something

00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:25,220
something something concrete about

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,340
climate change by editing OpenStreetMap

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:33,540
so let me explain this was something

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:36,420
that K that was proposed actually by a

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,840
collaborator of mine who's Jack Kelly

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,900
who started a foundation called open

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,900
climate fix and they one of the tasks

00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:49,890
that they want to work on is predicting

00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,960
the output from solar panels what may be

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,430
surprising to a lot of people is that

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,820
even in very advanced technological

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,549
countries we don't know how much energy

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,610
is coming in to the national electricity

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,500
grid from solar panels there are

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,619
specific reasons behind that that

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,530
actually don't know so if we can predict

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:16,440
how much energy is coming from solar

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,650
panels then we can burn less fossil

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,720
fuels at a national level certainly in

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,870
the UK and in most of the European

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,550
countries as well for example so what we

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,320
want to do is put two things in here to

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,680
predict what is coming from solar panels

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,959
we need to predict firstly the very

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,610
short term essentially whether

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,190
predictions but they're actually quite

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,860
detailed cloud cover predictions that

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,530
tell us about the solar irradiation and

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,989
if we put those together with the exact

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,080
locations and other information about

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,030
solar panels then the problem is solved

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,890
we can predict the amount of electricity

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,980
coming from solar panels and we can

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,950
actually save on the global scale

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,800
megatons of cut of co2 equivalents so

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,170
this is this is concrete if you want to

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,570
see the calculations behind that they

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,160
are available I'm not going to talk more

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,660
about the calculations but this is this

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,299
is one of the main points that I want to

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:20,940
make that actually mapping solar panels

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:24,000
does have can have a direct impact in

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,980
OpenStreetMap already there are there is

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,230
plenty of great information about

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,630
electricity and power networks this

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,720
sorry wrong button this this

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,760
visualization is something created by

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,579
not by me but it's been going for a

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,250
while open infra map and it's it shows a

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,660
really gorgeous rendering of various

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:51,690
different aspects of the power network

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,760
that is captured in OpenStreetMap there

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,860
are some countries that already have

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,040
really good mapping of solar panels and

00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,070
solar farms we're talking I'm talking

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,610
here from a UK context where we're going

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:08,400
to use we want to pilot what we want to

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:14,489
do in the UK before taking it out to a

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,289
global scale so in OpenStreetMap

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,120
certainly at the start of the year there

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,880
was a very little data about

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,000
solar panels and solar farms in the UK

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,060
but that if there are other sources of

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,680
data there are official data this what

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,050
you see on the right is a rendering of

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,390
some of the the open data that comes

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,370
from the UK government so it's great

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:39,360
that the UK government provides this

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:42,420
data in nicely licensed open data

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,160
formats and we can use that it doesn't

00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,400
give us the whole answer because for

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,260
example the locations of solar

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,010
installations in those data often

00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,990
approximate or maybe address based

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:58,910
rather than latitude longitude base

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:01,410
which has some complications and

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,740
generally there is good coverage of

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:07,500
large-scale installations but actually

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,620
the the missing part of the puzzle is

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,530
often the small-scale domestic and

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,919
commercial solar panels and that's

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,570
important

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,070
I'm going to be talking about the UK but

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,200
a lot of these lessons carry over to

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:27,720
other countries as well certainly in the

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:31,320
global North in the UK we have about a

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,530
thousand solar farms and about a million

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:38,970
solar panels okay and our goal is to map

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:41,700
them all we're not just interested in

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:45,030
the solar farms important as they are

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,830
we're also were definitely interested in

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,650
the smaller scale solar panels because

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,720
they actually contribute together a

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:55,200
significant amount of the solar capacity

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:59,160
that's available in the country the

00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,200
other thing to note is that in aerial

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,180
imagery it's actually pretty easy to

00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,180
spot solar farms usually the larger

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:10,860
installations whereas these things as

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,940
we'll see can be trickier so we want

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,520
both of these things they're quite

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,950
different a solar farm quite a large

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,460
object often with metadata available and

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:23,840
smaller domestic solar panels are

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:26,060
quite a different thing to map so one of

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,610
the things that other people always ask

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,440
when they hear about this project is why

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,419
not use machine vision why not apply

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,360
some machine learning to this and it is

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:38,030
possible there are projects specifically

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,479
dedicated to detecting these kind of

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:44,690
installations they can detect large

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:47,000
farms very well their strange objects

00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:50,509
when you look in aerial imagery I don't

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,979
know if you've seen them yourself but as

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:55,930
you might be able to see on here they're

00:06:51,979 --> 00:07:00,500
very often oriented due south and though

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:02,810
they look different too to most other

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,590
things you might encounter small-scale

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,270
is very difficult this this is an

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,849
example that I've found myself this is

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,460
in London and there are in this image

00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:16,340
three different types of the solar panel

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,110
actually next door to each other in the

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,780
same street and they're all very

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,490
different the actual visual qualities of

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,409
them they're different shapes they're

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:28,070
different layouts some of them are flat

00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:29,060
some of them are standing up and one

00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,330
thing with founder's we've gone through

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,550
this is that for aerial imagery it's not

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,860
just the quality that is crucial for

00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:40,039
this we would love to have you know as

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,590
fine resolution imagery as we can it's

00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,539
also important to have the age so

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,349
knowing the age of the imagery would be

00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:51,229
great but actually a lot of the solar

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:53,090
capacity in the in many countries has

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,159
actually been installed very recently in

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:59,060
certainly the past five years and maybe

00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:02,330
the past 2 or 1 year so fresh imagery is

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,440
going to be vital for this if you want

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,370
to do it purely through aerial imagery

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:15,710
also for machine vision you need

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:17,750
training data and so I'm putting the

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,389
machine vision aside for the moment but

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,130
that also comes into play here there are

00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:25,000
a lot of false friends that you find

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,980
when you encounter this it's really

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,590
there are a lot of things that are very

00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,900
very difficult to disambiguate in aerial

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,039
imagery if you go to visit a place you

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,330
might be able to tell the difference

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,240
between a window in a roof and a solar

00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:43,030
panel on a roof and especially with good

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,250
imagery can be resolvable but it's very

00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,350
very difficult sometimes this is a

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,110
lovely example that I found which has

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:53,380
you see there is a sort of commercial

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:56,200
scale set of solar panels on the right

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,210
there but if you if you think about the

00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,950
visual image there and compare that to

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,450
these windows in the side of a block of

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,560
flats you know you can see there are a

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,210
lot of false friends there a lot of

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,730
things that have relatively similar

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,110
appearance certainly going to be

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,850
confusing for machine learning

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,020
algorithms and it really doesn't make a

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,370
bit of a headache when you're doing

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:18,670
aerial manual aerial scanning as well

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:20,860
also I live near a canal and so I know

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,470
for sure that I see a lot of canal solar

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,610
panels on when I walk up the canal but I

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:29,560
don't want to map them because they're

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:32,440
not going to be very useful long term so

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,150
what we did as a UK community was a

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,950
quarterly project so this is something

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:42,640
that regularly happens organised by the

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:46,660
uk-based our seven community and I'm

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,400
very happy that the community was

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:55,510
interested in the idea of mapping solar

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:58,060
panels so we have we we organized it

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:01,530
through the wiki and there's also this

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:05,860
very nice tool which Gregory Williams

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:08,680
created which uses the official data

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:11,170
that I mentioned earlier it uses the

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,860
official data to help us search for

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:17,200
locations that are going to be good

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:22,960
places to go through and map from aerial

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:24,170
imagery the the process run the is a

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,060
three month project

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,950
and it's just about coming to its

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:33,500
conclusion so it's July August September

00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:37,430
this year a couple of things about

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:41,630
tagging so the basics are easy we have

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:44,060
the standard power tagging scheme is

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,940
great we have we have tagging for solar

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:51,500
farms we have tagging for solar panels

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:55,220
fantastic there are a couple of a couple

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:59,540
of extra metadata which are particularly

00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,610
useful so we would love to know the

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,050
capacity the power output that we're

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,690
going to expect from any given

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,430
installation for solar farms that's

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,490
that's often public because of the

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:14,020
planning data so if something is a 100

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:18,170
megawatt farm or a 50 or a 10 megawatt

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,130
often we know that and clearly if we

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,680
want to predict the amount of

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,150
electricity coming from a from a power

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,190
plant then this is one of the most

00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,440
important things but for domestic

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:31,490
installations we very rarely notice we

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,980
very rarely have access to this so we

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,360
use proxies so as you see we've got for

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,940
example counting the number of modules

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,330
the number of squares that you see on a

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,730
on a rooftop or the area that you get

00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,830
from the polygon both of these are

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,300
things that we use as heuristics which

00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,330
are going to help us to estimate the

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,090
power output um the other thing that's

00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:55,550
really useful in terms of the small

00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,830
scale is the orientation so is it

00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:01,640
pointing due south is it pointing west

00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:04,490
east when we come to the prediction part

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,490
of this the orientation with respect to

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,870
the Sun is going to be really useful in

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,760
predicting over a scale of minutes and

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,530
hours the profile of energy is coming

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,430
out of this so one thing I will advocate

00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:19,250
is to try to capture the orientation of

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,780
these things which we can do from aerial

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,090
mapping it gets a little bit more

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,800
confusing when you're doing in person

00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:27,590
nothing in the street because you know

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,230
thinking about where compass directions

00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:34,490
is a little bit of an extra thought

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:36,710
process um also the start date so the

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:40,340
installation dates if you know it is

00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:42,320
useful it's useful for two special

00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,940
reasons one is that when we come to try

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,820
and detect these things in aerial

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,130
imagery we will know if it's supposed to

00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,400
be in a particular set of aerial imagery

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:54,920
or not and secondly the start the

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,840
installation date again helps us to

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,360
brick predict the power output because

00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:02,360
that helps us to to to know what type of

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,070
technology might be installed and so and

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,520
so it gives us a little another clue

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,720
about the possible power output the

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,530
other thing that I've mentioned up here

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,170
is about nodes versus areas a lot of the

00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,600
mapping that we've had is has been

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:23,000
dropping nodes into place which can be

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:26,330
very fast but counter arguments against

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,610
that are if we draw areas so putting a

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:34,460
nice polygon around the solar

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,070
installation then that helps us to

00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,260
estimate orientation it helps us in

00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:43,340
validation it helps us to be sure that

00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,960
this this module on one house is

00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,220
actually the one that was intended and

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,580
not the one on the next house for

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:52,310
example so it can be helpful nodes

00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:56,810
versus areas for this task is not a

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:58,640
resolved question I'm gonna say we are

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,620
going to use both of these things for

00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,770
our project and we are going to use them

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,300
in future machine learning work but we

00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:10,190
will see which which is the best

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:12,350
approach so I talked about the OSM

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,760
course of the project the progress was

00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,350
pretty good so what you see on the

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,270
screen at the moment is the progress

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,570
before we started the solar they're the

00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:22,580
quarterly project so in about March we

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,290
started talking about it and so a few of

00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:28,520
us started mapping things just to try

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:31,730
things out and so we have we started the

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,720
year with I think five thousand in the

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,629
UK

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,240
pretty good okay so we start the costly

00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:42,709
project and it goes like this this is

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,149
pretty good and I had you know I'm not

00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:46,250
gonna tell you what my target was but I

00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,540
had a target in mind and we were sort of

00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,050
heading for it it was looking pretty

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,379
good

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:55,149
and then this happened this is amazing

00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:56,990
right this is this is the power of

00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,610
OpenStreetMap and you know how it is

00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,740
with some you knows when people get

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,709
enthusiastic and we have some really

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,360
dedicated people which is great and

00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:07,699
people put their minds to it and think

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,110
about how to do this efficiently we can

00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,910
guess in great progress so this comes

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,769
from dedicated mappers it comes from

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:17,029
having some official data to guide us

00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:17,509
and from hoeing I guess motivation so

00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:20,089
yeah

00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:23,449
we have we have we have now got more

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:25,629
than 100,000 solar panels mapped in the

00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:28,250
UK that's it that's one tenth of the

00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:30,170
estimated total capacity so that's

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,639
fantastic if anyone here was involved in

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,740
that then I want to thank you very much

00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,579
I know Jerry who's a co-author on this

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:40,310
presentation did a lot of work on this

00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:42,079
we have another few days left another

00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,850
few days before the end of September and

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,319
if anyone wants to join in then we'd be

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:50,870
very very grateful and just for a little

00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:53,029
bit of obsessing on it here's the data

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,009
that we've mapped on the left you see

00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:57,560
solar farms on the right you see solar

00:15:55,009 --> 00:16:00,110
panels you'll see the differences in in

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,389
distribution and location the vast food

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,339
we've got let's remember the numbers now

00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:05,870
but we've got lots of solar farms

00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:09,889
although this at the top we've got about

00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:12,410
600 or 700 solar farms and then as I

00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:19,519
said about hundred thousand separate

00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:21,110
small scale solar installations yes as

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,009
I've said I want to thank the people we

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:26,630
have about 130 UK mappers I think

00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:28,430
explicitly taking part in this process

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:32,209
this is just from analyzing the user IDs

00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,589
that took part and also the people who

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:35,600
were involved in shaping this whole

00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:37,459
thing there are lots of people involved

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,330
I've put some names up on those people

00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:43,160
who were in special

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:45,950
involved in discussing and planning and

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,100
now some observations so as I've said

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:53,090
the larger solar farms are pretty much

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,830
fine from an OpenStreetMap point of view

00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,200
I don't think we need to worry too much

00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,060
about it they're often available in

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,880
official data such as planning data

00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,670
they're very very easy for machine

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,190
learning to to learn to detect and

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,610
they're very easy from aerial imagery as

00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:14,000
well so really for others of community

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:19,970
and especially in where we have a grid

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,590
connected small scale solar the mapping

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,930
of the small-scale solar is where is

00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:26,840
where we are you know important

00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:29,930
value-added um something that's really

00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:33,320
really came out again and again is that

00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:36,650
the data are highly clustered solar

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,930
farms as well as solar panels we find

00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,310
very often that they're clustered there

00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,770
are many reasons for this there are

00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:45,320
geographical reasons why places would be

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,720
good and bad for this there are social

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,130
reasons why you might get a solar panel

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,200
because your neighbors getting a solar

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,740
panel lots of different things going on

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,810
there is also of course clustering in a

00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,480
particular mappers effort if I'm going

00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,910
to map my local region then maybe there

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,520
is clustering due to the efforts of the

00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,650
mother this has consequences for

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,470
analysis because we can't assume that

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,300
what we've got is a representative

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,180
distribution even though where we've got

00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:17,120
a large portion of the data so this this

00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,760
clustering is something to be aware of

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,300
in analysis it's also something to be

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,210
aware of in mapping because searching

00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,920
randomly can be a little bit fruitless

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,260
sometimes this that you'll be hit these

00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,150
clusters and you find loads of solar

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,520
panels all in one region and that's

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,560
fantastic

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,260
the imagery quality gives us a massive

00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,290
variation in usefulness it really does

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,830
and so what we'd love in order to sort

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,530
of take this forward is

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,090
if machs our or any other nice people

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,010
are in the audience and want to help us

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,200
find all the solar panels in the country

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:57,120
and in the world you know we'd love some

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:59,300
good imagery to help with us oh yeah

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:04,290
this is nice so when you're mapping

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:06,420
small scale solar sometimes you can see

00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,590
when you walk in the street you can see

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,200
some things that aren't going to be

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,270
visible and the aerial imagery but

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,550
conversely there's plenty that you can't

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,980
see from ground level and you're only

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:19,380
going to see from aerial so in practice

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,830
we have to have both of these types of

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,840
mapping and yes we have this ongoing

00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:28,380
thing about fast mapping versus craft

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:32,340
mapping in the in the plot here the blue

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:35,070
block is is nodes everything else is the

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,320
is the areas and so we've got a vast

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,060
majority of the additions come as single

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,820
nodes and then we've got the slightly

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,700
more detailed stuff coming as about a

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,320
tenth of the data there it's great for

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,490
us to have both of these things and

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,050
we're going to analyze both of these

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,820
things I think it's still an open

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,800
question about exactly which is the

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,360
right strategy I know this has a lot of

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,650
parallels with for example the

00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:01,010
humanitarian data mapping where you know

00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:04,140
substitute buildings for solar panels

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,750
the current work that we're going to do

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,150
we've got a new project and what I say

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,490
we I'm talking it now about me and open

00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:14,670
climate fix we have some work which is

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:17,700
funded by the Alan Turing Institute in

00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:20,490
London and we're going to take the data

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,530
from OpenStreetMap but also from other

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,400
sources we're going to do some data

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:28,260
wrangling so that we can get sort of a

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,120
combined rich source of data which we

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,390
then put together to create these these

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,190
predictions that I talked about and as

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,450
part of this data wrangling we're going

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,970
to do a little bit of work which will

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,560
hopefully provide more suggestions for

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,670
things that can go into OpenStreetMap

00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,260
but you know this is just sort of

00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:49,360
general ongoing work the conclusion is

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:52,249
map solar photovoltaics please

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,919
we've done really good work in the UK I

00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:57,139
am aware that other countries do some

00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,850
other countries have good mapping of

00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:01,340
solar panels I think Germany and Italy

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:06,230
are the main ones that come up in when I

00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:10,580
search for the data we want to take this

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:14,179
global we're going to be able to reduce

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:19,039
the use the amount of co2 emissions in

00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:20,690
the national grid power systems the UK

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,309
is a relatively small country but where

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,980
we're doing this and we want to do we

00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:29,840
want to make the same process available

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:32,210
worldwide so mapping solar and solar

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,340
installations in your own country is

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:39,470
going to be valuable we are using this

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:42,860
data and broadening out from the project

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,690
that I have in mind this you know we I

00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:48,289
probably don't need to argue this too

00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:50,480
much to you but open data is a

00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:52,159
foundation a seed for other people to

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,679
have other ideas and do different things

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,470
with this data maybe people we can use

00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,389
it to create training dates new training

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,369
data for machine learning for example we

00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:03,919
can certainly use it there may be ideas

00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:08,299
about planning solar installations that

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,649
can be done with this yeah so if anyone

00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,029
wants to come over something great to do

00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:14,059
with this new data then we'll be very

00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:15,409
pleased and I'm gonna say again thank

00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:18,200
you to all the mappers because they're

00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:20,559
the lifeblood of this so that's it thank

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,559
you very much

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,410
infolet are very good and very inspiring

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:37,620
are there any questions

00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:39,390
I mentioned sort of aerial photography

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,520
have you looked at and sentence

00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,890
satellite data because the latency is a

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,520
lot shorter than no photography for

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,870
identifying the big ones at least yes so

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,700
the question was about sentinel

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,260
satellite data I think Gerry actually

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,820
has done more with this than I have so

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,210
would you mind taking the microphone up

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,280
there he can answer so just a general

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,410
thing the sentinel data is obviously not

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,960
particularly high resolution so it's not

00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:05,940
great for the small scale spotting of

00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,549
things but it does have for example

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,160
other wavelengths than visible and can

00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:13,200
be useful Gerry yes yes I've used

00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,700
Sentinel explicitly for mapping soul

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,790
earth ore but it's not got the

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:23,400
resolution for mapping the rooftop solar

00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:25,770
I mean in particular there are two or

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,059
three solar installations on top of

00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,830
reservoirs so they're floating

00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:32,309
installations which I was particularly

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:34,049
interested in fund and one was very

00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:37,500
recently I was manage to find it on

00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:39,570
Sentinel and also one I saw coming back

00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,059
on the train from open data camp in

00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:44,880
Aberdeen which are located with Sentinel

00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:52,440
and the moisture index is very useful

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:56,520
for finding them when they're in the

00:23:52,440 --> 00:24:01,530
back if you go right to the back oh yeah

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:04,350
who's going this my opinion yeah so as I

00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:07,200
see it you found about 15% of all the

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,940
small scale solar cells in your data do

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,549
you have any indication where to look

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:14,490
for to find the restaurant like from the

00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:20,220
public data that are per county or

00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:23,190
whatever yes yes the the process is not

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,590
complete in that sense in the the

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,100
official data that we have do tell us

00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,320
where to look for the

00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,210
things that we haven't yet mapped so yes

00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,090
it's simply a question of pushing on

00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:36,730
through and we'll see if enthusiasm how

00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,260
far it takes us yeah there was a

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,890
question right at the back of there yeah

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:44,549
yeah I hope to see somebody to run up

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:48,370
here to have some exercise and afternoon

00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:50,530
anyway I wanted to warn that nowadays we

00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,450
have the greatest solar panels which are

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,010
not visible even if you are sitting on

00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,980
that or touching with your hand you

00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:59,470
cannot recognize it so in the future it

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:02,860
will be harder and harder to see the new

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:05,110
small-scale installations but to thank

00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,770
you for working on that this renewable

00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:11,380
energies are extremely important things

00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:13,299
to attack you with hmm yeah thanks yeah

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,740
there's a lot of complications another

00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:16,990
complication which you haven't mentioned

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,570
is that you don't really know from

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,789
looking at a solar installation whether

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,950
it's active whether it's connected to

00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:26,370
the grid there there are other

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,409
complications in here but yeah we can

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:31,000
yes of solar tiles are gonna be very

00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:33,820
hard to integrate we just hope people

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,120
will add them yeah can't I add a couple

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,799
of riders to that one of my focuses in

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,280
this quarterly project is to ensure that

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,890
we had the official data is by local

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,390
authority area local government area so

00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,990
one of my targets was that we had at

00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:53,640
least five local government areas where

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:57,309
we had over 80% of the available

00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:00,549
predicted solar panels we have one place

00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:04,539
which is about 96% and a few in the 80%

00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:09,880
range and then about 20 which have more

00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:11,559
than half identified so they provide

00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,570
there that there's a sort of baseline

00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:21,730
for how likely we are to get and

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:24,250
completeness of coverage and solar tiles

00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,080
and solar slate I haven't seen any solar

00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,840
slate but solar tiles are still

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,259
recognized

00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,909
reasonable quality aerial imagery if you

00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:35,600
look at one of my recent math Hillary

00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:40,190
traces I made a special voyage to visit

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:44,059
20 houses which has sold the tiles so if

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:55,639
you up for some SK 53 Quint math Hillary

00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:58,850
traces in Nottingham you might find you

00:26:55,639 --> 00:27:00,980
touched a bit on some people the mapping

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:04,730
node some people a touch of mapping

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:06,950
areas but there's also different matters

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:10,850
are you worried about different

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:13,580
qualities or strikes me that couple of

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,799
things that we had issues we have the

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:19,070
folks in shape up in the past things

00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:21,019
like to map a might stop mapping far

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,940
away but as they think someone else you

00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:25,669
know they might not go too far but I

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,220
think I'll Dan's mapping from that

00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:32,029
direction and and it gets hard to know

00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:34,220
whether gaps are and dealing with it not

00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:40,490
being people that have been trained in

00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:43,249
all the same ways we haven't really seen

00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:46,100
problems with that and I don't see it as

00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:50,210
a major problem because we have all all

00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:52,369
sorts of different sources of missing

00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,740
data there are lots of different reasons

00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:56,869
for missing data and it certainly in

00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,610
terms of analysis that's not going to be

00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:02,149
a particularly big problem because the

00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:06,129
problem is they're in intrinsically in

00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:06,129
terms of mapping and completing the map

00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:11,690
yeah yeah maybe one thing I would like

00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:14,509
to do is is is it in order to scale it

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,909
up is to take it to a much more

00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:18,289
crowdsource approach in the sense of

00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:20,929
people who aren't involved notes

00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:23,480
OpenStreetMap at all and now and there

00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:24,799
there's a very tricky question of how to

00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,840
get people who don't do any

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,149
OpenStreetMap to walk down the street

00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,769
and say these three are in stro

00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:33,019
OpenStreetMap already but i've spotted

00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:34,580
this one and i'm not actually sure the

00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:37,480
best way to do that but we'd really like

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,480
to do something along

00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:45,200
