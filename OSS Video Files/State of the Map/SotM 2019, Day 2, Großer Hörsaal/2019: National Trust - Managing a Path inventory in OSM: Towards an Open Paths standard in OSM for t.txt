Title: 2019: National Trust - Managing a Path inventory in OSM: Towards an Open Paths standard in OSM for t
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	The talk describes the use of OSM as part of an asset management process using a crowd of National Trust staff, volunteers and the public to maintain an network inventory of an estimated 20,000 km of paths (both Public Rights of Way and permissive paths). The process pro-actively notifies local staff of changes to enable on-ground validation.  The process required the definition, and consistent application of, a UK standard for path tagging.

The National Trust (NT) is a charity set up to look after special places in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Now the largest land owner in the UK, NT cares for more than 250,000 hectares of land including 775 miles of coastline, 100,000 hectares of statutory wildlife sites, 28,000 buildings and structures, 300 historic mansions and gardens. 
The NT operates a membership business model which provides members with complimentary access to our pay-for-entry visitor attractions, but also seeks to provide extensive free access to the countryside. The pay-for-entry visitor attractions welcomed 2.5 million visitors in 2018, and an estimated 300 million visits to countryside sites.  
Recent internal analysis estimates that NT look after a network of 20,000km of footpaths which comprises both legally designated ‘Public Rights of Way’ (25%) and permissive paths (75%). Permissive paths are those where access to members and/or the public is provided, and the condition of the path is monitored. Currently there is no single digital inventory of Public Rights of Way or permissive paths in the UK. 
The Paths Project is capturing a digital inventory of paths on National Trust in order to:
    • Demonstrate how NT are fulfilling our core purpose of providing access to special places.
    • Improve asset management including maintenance and enhancement of the path network, 
    • Provide a digital base for trail curation and enhanced visitor experiences.
A review of options concluded that the OpenStreetMap would be the best system for management of the National Trust Paths Inventory. This enables the capture of a digital path data to a defined standard to be carried out by the Trust’s extensive local
staff, volunteer network and also any citizens with an interest in paths.  The data is then available royalty-free to anybody for the development of products to encourage appropriate access to our special places.
This approach is not without challenges. The constancy of path tagging in OSM is not currently suitable for describing the access to the path network. In order to ensure the paths data met the NT needs we worked with OSM UK, and other partners to apply consistent data standards for tagging paths in OSM. This standard is specific to the UK context and enables to differentiation between legal rights of way and permissive paths. 
In working with local staff to review the current representation a number of challenges were identified relating to the official register of paths and the reality on the ground. This is an evolving area and as the project progresses it is expected that other challenges will emerge.
The project set-up an automated process for notifying local staff to changes in their area of knowledge so that changes could can be validated against the reality on the ground.  This work provided an interesting technical and organisational challenge and is a somewhat novel approach for large asset owning organisations seeking to utilise OSM and the power of the crowd to manage asset data.
The initial focus of the project is on the existence of paths and the legal basis for access. Once this is captured additional attributes relating to accessibility, condition will be considered.
Whilst this project is still to be completed, other potential asset types that could be managed in OSM in this way have been identified.
The true value of a UK wide paths inventory will only be realised by having a comprehensive, authoritative and trusted dataset. This cannot be achieved by NT alone. When the project is suitable mature NT will make available any parts of the process to other organisations to encourage adopt a similar approach.

	00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:13,670
with few Ian and Andy will talk to us

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,760
they are from natural trust and they

00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,530
will talk about managing a past

00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,460
inventory in OpenStreetMap

00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:25,550
and we excited it please it's your thank

00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,220
you thank you very much it's great to be

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,350
here stay to the map again I did a talk

00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,820
back in 2013 and we were sort of

00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,890
thinking about what we might want to do

00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,690
with OpenStreetMap as an organization

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,190
and it's great to come back here and

00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,079
talk to you a bit about something that

00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,329
we are doing and how we're starting to

00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,980
contribute back so yet to introduce

00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:44,630
ourselves I think it's got my name on

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,460
the program but I've brought my

00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,870
colleagues who are much more adept at

00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,940
the technical side of things so I'm Hugh

00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,560
Davis from the National Trust and Ian

00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,950
doors and Andy woods who are working on

00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,750
the project so first of all a little bit

00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,260
of a National Trust for those guys who

00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,820
aren't from the UK or you don't know us

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,269
National Trust is Europe's largest

00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:07,189
conservation charity we were founded at

00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,579
the end of the 19th century by a group

00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:13,399
of Victorians who they wanted to protect

00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:14,719
beautiful places in in perpetuity and

00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:18,649
particularly to give people access to

00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:21,829
those places we have 5.5 million members

00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:23,929
in the UK and our membership model is

00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:26,420
the primary source of funding for all of

00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:29,389
their of the conservation work we do in

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,840
the UK we cover we're quite unique as a

00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:34,909
as a charity because we cover the

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,450
heritage and the the nature conservation

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:41,840
side of things we have a large portfolio

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,029
of property we look after around 250,000

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,840
hectares of man's we have around 350

00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:51,829
historic houses 780 miles of coastline

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,409
and so on so for us it's it's a real

00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:57,679
challenge trying to manage all of those

00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:59,389
assets which is why a tool like

00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:02,029
OpenStreetMap is really interesting to

00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:03,529
us we also have a tremendous pool of

00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:06,200
volunteers for the national trust around

00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:07,340
70,000 volunteers so we're kind of

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,369
interested in how each

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,220
how we can use open source products and

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:20,569
crowd sourcing more to to support the

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:23,930
work we're doing so a bit about access

00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:25,760
so we're an access organization and we

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,580
provide broad public access to our

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,880
properties through around 20,000

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,370
kilometres of of PARs we think we have

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,720
around 20,000 kilometres one of the

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,340
reasons that we're doing this project is

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,180
we don't have any central records or a

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,190
central database of of our cars but we

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,870
do know that walking is the most popular

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,470
activity at National Trust you think we

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:53,660
have around 300 million visits for for

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:55,430
people walking on our properties and so

00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,750
so clearly it's really important that we

00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,190
that we understand the scale of this

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,170
asset and we and we're managing it

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,580
effectively so the problem that we're

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,640
really trying to solve with this project

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,980
is first of all quantity so knowing how

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,690
many how many miles or how many

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,170
kilometers of path we look after is

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,630
important to us you know it helps us

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,340
engage with visitors who who maybe don't

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,230
think of the organ a tional clusters as

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,260
a walking organizational providing

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,150
access in that way as I say we don't

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,250
really know how many miles a footpath we

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,750
look after and therefore it's difficult

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,299
to manage

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,980
we were also keen to make sure that

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:34,340
we're providing access in the right

00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,500
places so you know we we know we have

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,760
piles all over Arnon but actually it's

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,350
important to make sure that we have

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,790
really good access provision around the

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,319
places where people live so that we can

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:47,000
provide more public access in those

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,040
areas quality we want to provide people

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,810
with really great experiences when they

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,100
come to our places and for many people

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,319
footpaths and part of the way people

00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,510
will experience our places so we want to

00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,569
make sure that they they remain safe

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:05,329
that the paths are well maintained and

00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:07,220
then actually we can be inclusive in the

00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,920
experiences we offer by providing access

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,290
to people with different needs in terms

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,900
of access

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,690
so understanding that dimension and

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,630
putting sensible maintenance schedules

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,459
around path maintenance as well and also

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,669
connectivity so obviously the national

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:28,720
interest on operating in a vacuum there

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:32,650
are we have a good statutory network of

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,009
public paths which are are looked after

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,419
by our local authorities so we're

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:41,860
connecting into other areas there's also

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:46,810
quite a lot of national trails both just

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:48,310
like recycling and walking so just

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,370
moving on to talk a little bit about the

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,310
project itself we've kind of built the

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,650
project like like a pyramid so at the

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,840
bottom of the pyramid is the is the path

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,759
inventory so this is a sort of we're

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,500
hoping to create a central register of

00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:07,990
all paths on our land that would include

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,900
both paths that are stats to trade so we

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,130
have to provide access but also the ones

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,440
that are permissive that we provide

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,680
additional on top of that legal up legal

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,449
rights away on top of there we have

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,370
something called empty primary path so

00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,220
these are the main paths that are places

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,750
the way that people get around

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,090
properties and we know that we need to

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,860
maintain these paths to a high standards

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,110
they have to be well surfaced and in

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,150
good condition to keep up with the

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,710
volume of people that are using them and

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,190
then on top of there we have empty

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,720
trails so this is about the kind of

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,760
activities that people will come and do

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,310
on those on those paths so you know a

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,960
trail to go in and see some important

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,669
archaeology or interesting archaeology

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,250
or a nature trail to look at different

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:54,550
aspects of habitats and species that

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,880
might be located in our properties so we

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,539
think that a really good trail

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,490
functionality digital trail

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:02,530
functionality is built on a solid

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:08,080
foundation of a good quality piles

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:11,199
inventory and yeah so we we have a

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,669
obviously our internal staff who can

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,289
help maintain that inventory but we're

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,300
also looking to the accidental community

00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,669
and OpenStreetMap and one of the reasons

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,999
that we want to use OpenStreetMap is to

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:24,149
is to help us with that vast task

00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:25,319
of 20,000 kilometers of path so I can

00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:27,539
hand over to ian who's gonna take you

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,579
through the project in more detail okay

00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,860
thank you

00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:34,139
okay so when we started the project we

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,749
had to think about what components are

00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,459
going to make it successful so first of

00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:40,919
all as he was said we've got to look at

00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:44,369
all paths in the UK you have very

00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,899
specific land access rights since

00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:47,549
Thatcher tree paths you have to get in

00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,289
there but also the permissive ones the

00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:52,559
ones over and above that statutory duty

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:54,569
to provide those paths we wanted the

00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,459
data to be open one of the issues and UK

00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:57,989
is using the Ordnance Survey data every

00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,849
time you use it you have to pay royalty

00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:02,449
as it gets very complicated we wanted a

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:04,619
nice open dataset to put our paths into

00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:06,629
so we thought OpenStreetMap straight

00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:09,629
away so we actually went on to

00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:11,279
OpenStreetMap and downloaded the paths

00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,439
to try and answer the question what

00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,169
length of path have we got and then it

00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,519
got very complicated the tagging to run

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,610
so which is that tree which is

00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,110
permissive it didn't give the answer we

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,029
need it it didn't we didn't have the

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,999
confidence that was what was in there it

00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:29,099
was correct so quickly realised would

00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:30,959
need a standard so establishing a

00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:34,589
standard tagging scheme for recording

00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,899
paths in the UK situation so we've been

00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:39,029
talking to our 7 UK we've been putting

00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,800
out on the forums blogs for people to

00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:44,759
put into what that might look like in

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:48,119
the UK then we've got to use the crowd

00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,739
we can't digitize 20000 comments of path

00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:51,899
and keep it up-to-date very effectively

00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:54,539
ourselves with the technical skills

00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:57,059
required in OpenStreetMap we want a

00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:59,249
crowd so that crowd is gnashing to have

00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,989
central staff regional staff property

00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:02,969
our Rangers they're out every day on

00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:05,129
these properties we want those involved

00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:06,539
but they not gonna have the time to do a

00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:08,639
lot of the mapping so we want to have

00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:11,279
volunteers we've got 70,000 volunteers

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,199
out there not all of those are obviously

00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,149
outdoor volunteers but we want to use

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,949
them and then we want to use

00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:19,139
OpenStreetMap so we all got to combine

00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:23,339
all those different user groups to have

00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,749
an effective community one of the big

00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:28,349
things we think we need is a rules-based

00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:31,619
app online offline field editing tool

00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:34,750
and the spooch is too complicated to

00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:37,750
give to anyone but dedicated

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,750
detailed technical users in our opinion

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,060
so we want a simple rule based app that

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:47,470
we can do edits in the field so we're

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:49,420
looking at those the one thing one is a

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,950
monitor we want to check changes once

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,720
we've got a good data set that we think

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,330
is correct with the land access rights

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,000
and the existence of paths we want some

00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:01,180
any changes to that to be monitored so

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,240
we have written software to allow a

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:08,370
weekly emails to our angels to say paths

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,370
of change in your area go take a look

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,270
another overhead is publishing actually

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:18,430
to download a set of open paths from

00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,750
OpenStreetMap for the average user to

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,550
try and get to a mass audience it's

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,170
actually quite a tricky thing to do so

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,580
what we're Pro to do is once we've got

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,740
the data is actually making it very

00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,470
easily just pass it on basically the

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,630
same licensing rules but just say here's

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:35,380
the data set it's updated weekly grab it

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,700
from here and then we've got an ID to

00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,050
the trails in the future we're not

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,310
actually doing that at the moment but

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,960
we've got to understand what we think

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,280
we're going to do with the trails so we

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,620
can start to think about the issues

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,290
we're going to come across so those are

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:51,940
the components and we're in the way

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:53,820
we've done all stuff mention there so

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,670
we've agreed the path tagging standard

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,170
and we're going out and he's been going

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,910
around also met a lot of different

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,220
properties talking to the Rangers and

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,470
trying to capture for a small number

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,750
about 20 of our properties the actual

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,180
paths on the ground to learn how long

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,060
that takes what the interactions are to

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,220
achieve that we then have the monitor

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,790
code written and I'll show that in a

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,220
second

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,030
but we are planning to make this

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,910
open-source I would probably put it

00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:24,330
through github so you can go and get it

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,330
from there

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,870
so that isn't that tugging steamer so

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:42,520
that is on a a wiki link osm wiki the

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,140
URL is at the end of the presentation so

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,240
if you want to go on look at the scheme

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:50,070
we're proposing comment on it anything

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,070
like that the please feel free

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:03,640
okay so was as I said we have written

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:07,120
monitoring app that's readable from up

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,540
there so basically this is what it looks

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,980
like

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,840
the green which doesn't show up that

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,010
well our our property boundaries here

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,840
we're looking at hole in the cut in

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:25,090
North Somerset and what we have keep

00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:27,340
losing them oh I'm sorry is a bounding

00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,020
box for each property which is the area

00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:36,400
we're monitoring so each of our

00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:39,310
properties have a bounding box we have

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,780
the current full OpenStreetMap highways

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,070
network we include the highways because

00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:52,240
obvious there's a connectivity between

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:54,280
those and the paths and then we have a

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,680
weekly monitor so on a weekly basis on a

00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,840
Saturday night I think it is it runs and

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,280
looks at all changes that have occurred

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,920
on National Trust land within those

00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,750
bounding boxes and if there is changes

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,310
it picks up the email address from the

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:13,600
bounding box and it sends an email to

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:15,520
our Rangers to say go take a look so

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,750
what that looks like is that one of the

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,130
areas I just focusing on there so it's

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,740
stylized so you can see what's been

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,450
created what's been deleted where the

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,950
tags have changed where the geometries

00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,430
have changed or whether both have

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:35,350
changed and what you can do here is it

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:37,900
highlights the object there you can look

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,180
across and you can see that this way

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:44,250
highlighted was changed by Sailor Steve

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,780
from what a JW 92 said which is Andy and

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,880
all that it changed it was a bit of

00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,160
geometry and actually changed tagged

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,020
foot from yes the permissive so we just

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,090
have that sort of level information that

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,170
that's quite pedantic with one but there

00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:01,210
are quite often quite large changes so

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,330
that we are planning to make that open

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:06,160
source so it's Python code it goes out

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,339
and users they overpass API to get the

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,339
information

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,440
sorry actually closed the PowerPoint not

00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,440
moved it

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,710
okay so the next thing we're doing which

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,360
is next summer is we basically want to

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,300
start looking more at the trails so

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,940
using ODI open data Institute standard

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,560
to try and look at that we want to

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,170
extend the attributes so we're very much

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,150
focusing on the existence and the legal

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,700
access to those paths but then we want

00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,590
to start looking at condition

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,780
accessibility those kinds of attributes

00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,160
and we want to encourage wider adoption

00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,290
with other landowners

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,520
and interest groups it's great doing it

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,270
on National Trust land but we want a

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,310
national map and then phase three is we

00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:21,890
want to get all of our trails into open

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,350
active formats and then put that open

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,850
data out in out there and we want app

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,680
developers and everything to actually

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,090
take that data and create interesting

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,400
products for it interesting ways of

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,260
navigating going around we don't want to

00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,790
do that innovation and development will

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,590
provide the data and that other people

00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:40,850
do so so the tagging schema again is

00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,460
there I'm not going to go into that in

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,260
detail but basically you're we're

00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,510
focusing on the designation and the

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,370
physical side of things and then

00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,790
optionally we're looking at some of the

00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:54,320
extended attribution I'm now going to

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,630
hand to Andy to go through some of the

00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:02,270
case studies we found of her interesting

00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:04,220
examples of problems thanks and so I'm

00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,900
going to talk through some case studies

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,450
as a result of working with our

00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,090
properties so over this summer we've

00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,940
worked with a handful of properties just

00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,890
to look at trialing the method that

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,410
we've sort of presented here today but

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,220
also identify any issues before taking

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,980
them further

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:25,520
so one which is quite common is where

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,190
the root which is Matt in OpenStreetMap

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,110
so the green dotted line here doesn't

00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,120
necessarily match the definitive

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:37,910
information provided by local

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:39,950
authorities so in this instance the the

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,080
root here was verified on the ground so

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,080
the Ranger team we spoke to said that

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,820
this is correct who in fact we went to

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:50,330
visit this example as it's quite quite

00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,730
near to us and you can the reason that

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,010
it's so it's correct is as a very sort

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,279
of well established track which is there

00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,040
on the ground and

00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,629
is also a bridleway sign just so the to

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,980
the west of where the roof meets the

00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:07,230
road so in this instance we expect that

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,600
the definitive line is in fact incorrect

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,519
and the main reason we think this is

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,410
it's quite unlikely there's a water

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,790
crossing where that bridges and that the

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,189
road which sort of connects the two

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,600
there is quite well establishes it's

00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:23,790
obviously been there quite a long time

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,100
so we followed this one a bit further

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,980
and we went and spoke to the local

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,129
authority about this and they realigned

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:35,459
the definitive brighter way to meet the

00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:37,680
top section so it's bit on this of left

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:39,509
hand side it now meets the top bit and

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,370
where the road sort of starts they

00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:43,800
didn't have enough justification to move

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,449
the entire bride away onto National

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,240
Trust land there just wasn't enough

00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:50,009
evidence so it's an interesting case in

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,410
terms of our in terms of our case study

00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,540
I suppose if the whole bride away moved

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,240
on to National Trust land there's reason

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,910
that we can tag that as a public bride

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,829
away but for now we have a sort of

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,079
situation where the beginning section

00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:07,350
matches the definitive line and the rest

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,539
doesn't necessarily match it and if it

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,149
was a public boat away there's a

00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:14,250
different duty of care so the local

00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:16,770
authority would be responsible for the

00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:19,079
surface vegetation but as it stands as a

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:22,399
bit of ambiguity between sort of the

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:25,289
permissive access and the legal access

00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:28,820
the next example I talk you through is a

00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:31,559
piece of access land so in this instance

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,510
the member any member of the public has

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,940
a legal right what's called a right to

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:39,120
roam to walk anywhere in the yellow

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,419
shaded area so they don't need a path to

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,370
access any section on that land but in

00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,429
addition to that there's again a

00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:51,059
brighter way so they have a legal right

00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:53,490
to horse right and cycle along that line

00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:56,789
as well as walk anywhere in the yellow

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,409
shaded area when we went to speak to the

00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:00,929
local team about this

00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:02,429
they flag to us that this public

00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:04,640
right-of-way in fact goes over some

00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:08,010
quite sensitive habitats which

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,309
potentially could be cause additional

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,740
erosion damage from

00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:14,320
horse riders and cyclists and in fact

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,870
there's a track which has been mapped

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,120
further to the south which is far more

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,940
suitable for bridleway traffic in this

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,710
instance and in fact what they they said

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,470
to us is it's the route which is most

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:29,350
commonly used so in terms of our tagging

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:32,080
schema it's an interesting example so we

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,580
wouldn't not want to say that um not

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,379
want to tag the route going to North

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,360
that it's a public right-of-way but I

00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:39,600
suppose in an ideal situation in terms

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,529
of routing we'd want people to use the

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,210
more suitable track to the south the

00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:48,490
last example I'll talk you through and

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,990
it's not it's actually not on a piece of

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,139
National Trust managed land

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,869
it's a example which is a local to us

00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:59,080
and this is mapped in OpenStreetMap as a

00:18:55,869 --> 00:19:02,499
track and we noticed on the Ordnance

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,529
Survey 1 to 50,000 scale map so the UK's

00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:07,869
national mapping Authority's record of

00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:11,350
this track it's down there it's a minor

00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:13,330
road so the tags in OpenStreetMap that

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,960
are quite consistent to this so it's

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:21,100
designated access for horse foot bicycle

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,619
and motor vehicle but if we look at this

00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,049
track in reality it is it matches the

00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:28,419
OpenStreetMap physical tag quite well

00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:30,519
it's a nothing more than a farmer's

00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:33,850
track so perhaps only suitable for

00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:36,340
agricultural vehicles may maybe fall by

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,799
force and we had a look at the one of

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,899
the Reuters it's just on OpenStreetMap

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,769
and in this instance it would route a

00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:46,179
car down this bound this track so as I

00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:48,429
mentioned it's not on National Trust

00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:51,749
land but it's an interesting example of

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:54,820
how we perhaps would tag this against

00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:57,340
the definitive definitive information if

00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,889
it's not necessarily intended for for

00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,210
that use case so I'll pass you back over

00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:02,950
to Ian just to talk through the

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:07,539
remaining implications and challenges

00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:08,710
we've had very quickly and the reason

00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,549
we're here there's three of us at the

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:14,259
conference today is we want to

00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:17,259
understand a bit better the these four

00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:20,799
areas so one is crowd editing we want to

00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:23,650
learn how to effectively utilize a crowd

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:27,400
using a variety of us and

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:29,950
and the Rangers and our staff to work

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,710
out how to do that effectively we also

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,450
want to understand the impact of tagging

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,960
on routing algorithms so that we

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,940
understand changing it from a paper map

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,970
to infield navigation what's that

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:46,960
tagging mean how do those tags influence

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:49,000
what people are told then saying our

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,910
objective is to do it once get it out

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,670
there anyone can use it but the two most

00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,770
used in the UK for routing are probably

00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,050
the Ordnance Survey and Google and

00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,490
neither of those can use the data we're

00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,800
going to put out there because of the

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,800
share alike part of the OpenStreetMap

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,240
that's their issue and partly it's a

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,510
blocker to us so we want to understand a

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,730
bit more around that and then monitoring

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:16,210
we've we're setting ourselves up as an

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:18,880
authority editor with adhering to a

00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:22,809
standard we're policing these aren't

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,940
really osm type terms so we'd like some

00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:26,860
feedback on what how people see we are

00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,750
the landowners we do know what those

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,059
paths are what the legal definition is

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,070
well we are allowing additional access

00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:35,650
and we'd like to get that right we'd

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,630
like to tell people they do we have that

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,890
authority to go around and undo people's

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,620
edits we don't want to get in a ding

00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,990
dong going yes no yes no yes no how'd

00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,070
you manage that where our interests

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,900
we've always said that would never

00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,480
remove paths that exist on the ground

00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:53,860
we'd just tag them we'd say what's the

00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:56,110
term again discourage that was the tag

00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,610
that's used this courage where we don't

00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,929
want people to use it it's there it's on

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:02,620
the ground but we'd prefer that people

00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:05,559
didn't use it so we'll leave you with

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,780
that so any of those it's on the on our

00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,160
wiki page we've got a discussion on

00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,630
there please go on

00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:15,090
give us feedback let us know what you

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,090
think and thank you for your time

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:36,109
so thanks a lot to you for your talk and

00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:38,600
are there questions hi there yeah thank

00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:42,019
you for your talk I was just interested

00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:45,019
in whether you are including information

00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:46,850
on accessibility so people with mobility

00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:48,399
impairments I've missed the start of

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:52,159
your talk so you might have covered this

00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:54,109
and how you how you are tagging that and

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,850
collecting that I appreciate might be a

00:22:54,109 --> 00:23:00,409
big answer so I'm happy to talk about it

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:02,090
afterwards so at the moment what we're

00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:05,779
focusing on is getting the geometry and

00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,609
their legal rights mat once that's done

00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:09,409
it's on to tagging schemas which are a

00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:11,389
lot easier and you don't need the same

00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:13,730
technical overhead in the field to edit

00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:15,739
though so that's what we want to do in

00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,950
the next year is recommend what where

00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:21,529
we're going and we're using ODI active

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,779
open active initiative and we want to

00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:31,909
partner with those for difficulty and

00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:38,629
access type attribution questions if

00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:41,200
there's a question you Claire slight

00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:44,989
interest here I'm also a Ramblers

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,940
right-of-way officer however one of the

00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:51,109
things that I'm very keen on with

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:54,649
mapping and we're oh s M can beat

00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:57,889
Ordnance Survey is barriers they were

00:23:54,649 --> 00:24:00,919
big hindrance to people do you are

00:23:57,889 --> 00:24:04,129
youing tending to include the presence

00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:09,080
of styles kissing gates so routing

00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:12,559
algorithms can avoid those those are

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,029
exactly sort of barriers that we are

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,859
looking to capture we're not doing it in

00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:18,169
the first phase yeah but those are the

00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:19,730
things we are all trying to get Rangers

00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:21,379
more engaged with capturing that kind of

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,350
information at the moment so we can go

00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:25,630
with a data set to start with

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:29,760
yes I have a shorthand with my GPS when

00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:32,320
I'm walking to capture as much as a cam

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,780
no it would it would be a good idea when

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,760
we're engaging with the OSM community to

00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,470
have guidance on that from the style

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,850
that would make sense but we are

00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,000
concentrating on what we've got there

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:46,419
yes it's one anecdote from one of my

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,950
Rambler colleagues who works for Parrish

00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:52,600
path partnership and he went back a few

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,809
days after they installed the kissing

00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,340
gate and just to make sure it's all

00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:59,770
okayed had settled into the ground

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,480
correctly and he met an old man that is

00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:04,179
standing in the field just looking in

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,049
wonder and he said I haven't been able

00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:10,419
to get into this field for 15 years and

00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:19,450
that sort of is why this stuff's

00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:27,190
important anyway thank you one last

00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:29,049
question maybe two short ones and I

00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,960
think he touched a bit on your Ganga

00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:35,620
ranges involved or your wanting to and

00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,840
I'm just interested in how they've been

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,490
responding it takes us I know you're you

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,320
sing quite passion about - shakemap

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,740
which it's great but when you're telling

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,539
your Rangers oh we want you to do this

00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,309
there are any challenges that you've had

00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:52,900
many wouldn't Melbourne the actions that

00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:54,370
maybe could help us learn from yeah I

00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,080
think the biggest challenge for our

00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,789
Ranger community is just their time and

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,429
the and the scope of work that they're

00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:02,200
expected to cover so we've had a program

00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:04,570
running for the last four years around

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,400
their GIS development so we've been

00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:09,850
providing a lot of training on our

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,679
internal GIS tools that we have that

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,210
they use for work so what we're kind of

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,159
hoping that now that we're engaging them

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,940
in the OpenStreetMap side of things that

00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:17,890
they've released got a basic

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,510
understanding of points lines and

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,460
polygons and how things are represented

00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,659
in geographical space and that we can

00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,730
sort of bring them into this little

00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:26,289
street map journey as we go but actually

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:30,150
I think we found that there they're

00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:32,610
really interested as much about the

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,120
participation and engagement side of

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:41,990
OpenStreetMap as as much as they're the

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:43,640
sort of did the mapping yourself yes so

00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,540
