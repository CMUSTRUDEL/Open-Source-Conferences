Description: 
	Lightning Talks

## Human in the Loop: Verifying Machine-Generated Data for Better Maps
Said Turksever
Machine-generated map data has the potential to considerably accelerate mapping at scale. Combining it with human review helps ensure high data quality. We’ll show how a simple game-based tool helps verify the map data generated by Mapillary’s AI, and how that data helps enhance OpenStreetMap.

## Share the word
Ilya Zverev
WeeklyOSM is great, but is it the only channel for following news in OpenStreetMap? For most countries, yes. And that is sad. You can change it for the better: start a blog, record a podcast, tweet something. Here I will share my experience at keeping OSM community informed.

## Enhancing OSM with missing roads
Beata Tautan-Jancso
ImproveOSM is a powerful tool that detects and highlights areas in OSM where roads, one-way attributes, and turn restrictions are missing from the map. The first version of the JOSM plugin was released in 2015. Since then, the community has improved almost 200.000 areas with missing roads.

## Community led mapping helping in policy changes
Sibabrata Choudhury
Beginning of 2015 a process of community consultation and community led advocacy in the eastern state of India has resulted in several communities developing maps of their plots which has been a breakthrough experience.

## How to create a data annotation process used for navigation
Alina Negreanu
In this talk, the Telenav OpenTerra team will present how they built their data annotation team and the processes they developed in order to assure high-quality annotations, on which their AI algorithms heavily rely on. They will talk about good practices to use when building manual datasets and the hurdles they had to overcome in order to reach their quality requirements, having so far reached more than 600 000 annotations.

so you have joined OpenStreetMap and you

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,949
think how can you help the project like

00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:24,490
you can map and you can write software

00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:26,560
or teach opposite map but there is one

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,260
thing that's not very obvious but also

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,710
very important and that's writing and by

00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:35,469
the time don't in writing documentation

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,440
I'm in rs.12 and for nine years I have

00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:41,609
been writing the Russian OpenStreetMap

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,699
news blog which doesn't looks like this

00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:48,789
it's in Russian it's Google translated

00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:50,979
so when I started it was very fun

00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:56,589
knowing about opposite my boy in debt

00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:59,679
and it was very active like 50 entries a

00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:03,579
month I was writing about everything

00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,950
from I don't know new features and

00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:10,090
editors the website to translation of

00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:12,820
blog entries by other people and writing

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:16,840
the blog is interesting in that it is

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:20,140
different from sorry in that it is

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,980
different from a simple newsfeed like we

00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:27,940
got on Twitter or weekly resem here gets

00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:31,510
just description and a link and with the

00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:35,320
blog blog you really have a chance to go

00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:39,340
in-depth to research stuff to know about

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:43,540
each piece of the news as much as you

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:48,160
could to get on and give context context

00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:51,010
is very important because context gives

00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:56,500
you the deeper understanding of the

00:01:51,010 --> 00:02:01,270
project it makes each entry feel not

00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,950
just some random stuff but it makes a

00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,950
piece of a puzzle that fits into a

00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:09,599
global picture of OpenStreetMap so if

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,159
you understand indepence and it also

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,840
helps other like new people to

00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,790
OpenStreetMap understand the project

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,819
better because they don't know the

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,500
context and you give them give

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:25,079
and since our memory is associative and

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,689
it helps you remember stuff like I have

00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:30,090
written more than thousand entries to

00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:32,340
stress um and I remember a lot like

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,430
sometimes think that I forgot about

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:41,819
opacity of more than most people here

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:44,519
ever ever knew and finally context helps

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,599
us choose what news are most important

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:51,239
without it we think that bigger names

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:54,720
equal bigger news and that is almost

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,730
never the case like we write down weekly

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,730
we spot news that related to s3

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:02,370
microsoft jasmine AG in four three wars

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,919
even while we should look in smaller

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:09,019
news like projects made this overpass

00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,019
like some new developments and research

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:15,480
writing blog can be so yeah just try or

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,560
writing something and research is

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,900
something it becomes fun very quick

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,709
writing becomes tiring especially after

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,109
time for the other options like four to

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:32,040
five years we have made a Russian

00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:35,489
opposite my podcast we connected on

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:40,260
mumble with some other members from

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:43,199
Russian roots and community and just

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,109
discussed recent news invited guests to

00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,780
interview from J's field it was very fun

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:51,659
and not tiring because you just talk for

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,180
an hour and then splendid now we're on

00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:57,000
cleanup in publishing the record it's

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,189
really simple but there are drawbacks to

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,599
that obviously because not everyone has

00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:06,689
the time to listen to all of that and

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,040
podcasts are not released relatable if

00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:12,090
you don't know Rush and you cannot

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,970
listen to these pop empties recently

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,729
I've been doing telegram channel it's a

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,209
social network text oriented so unlike

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:26,610
Facebook Instagram snapchat or others

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:28,830
everyone who is what I write so in

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,809
telegram channel it provokes you to

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,979
write on a train on

00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:37,169
every time you read something or you

00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,479
thought of something and with that I

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:43,259
write about stuff tangent opposite map

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,659
like diversity like cell drain cars but

00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,150
in relation to opposite now so it gives

00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:54,960
our project a context hartsfield's in

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:56,879
the outside world okay so as a result I

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,059
think Russian community is most informed

00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,469
thanks to the blog and going in-depth

00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:03,779
into open State Park has allowed me to

00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:07,139
leave my development job to pursue

00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:10,650
career in opposite map so Triton's you

00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:13,620
may benefit the same thank you thanks

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,240
Julia all right I'm just trying to make

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,710
sure that we get to coffee break on time

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,589
so Piazza you're next

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,310
all right so if you have questions for

00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:26,189
Ilya where can they find you today

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,149
around around he's tall he's easy to

00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:29,580
find an audience

00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:40,979
all right thanks Ilya thanks for letting

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:43,169
me interview you - hi doing okay so my

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,719
name is Berra and I'm from Tirana Europe

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,870
and today I will talk you about how to

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:52,589
ends how to enhance or SM beat missing

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:55,620
roads so osm is an awesome app and has

00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:57,959
the majority of the roads mad more than

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,149
64 million kilometer roads are already

00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,490
present in osm but there are still

00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:04,919
places around the globe their routes are

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,490
missing from the map you can see there

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:12,240
or map where possible roads are missing

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:15,270
from the map starting with this idea and

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,149
how to improve OS m with missing roads

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,849
and using huge amount of probe data we

00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:23,219
have automatically detected areas where

00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:26,759
OS m needs to be updated with draughts

00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:29,459
pads and parking places info sm is a

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,099
powerful suite of tools that identifies

00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:33,240
and highlights location in OS m railroad

00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,280
small ways

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,289
and turn striction are probably missing

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,569
from them have the detections are

00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:41,639
available in Johnson via to improvise

00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:44,550
them too and also in the main idea

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,410
detour if you are interested of using

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,500
overall detection data you can tolerate

00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:52,139
it in CSV format from missing roads

00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,569
that's cobbler dot NAB slash dumps so

00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:58,500
the missing road project identified more

00:06:54,569 --> 00:07:01,080
than 2.6 million locations where roads

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,259
paths parking places and the whole

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,590
neighbourhoods are missing from OSN here

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:11,460
you can see an integration video some at

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:14,699
all and also with the ID tool and now I

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:18,180
will show you a short demo recording the

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,190
improv SM was awesome tool

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,400
so the improvisation plug-in can be done

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,860
with it from Joe's own story in order to

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,139
see missing roads you need to enable the

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,620
missing roads layer data can be filtered

00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:34,409
based on status and also type at high

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,780
some level you see clusters and as you

00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:39,479
zoom in starting with some level of 14

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,860
you can see actual tiles that contains

00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,380
GPS probes

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,680
indicating the roads that are missing

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:49,139
from our awesome in order to map the

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,539
roads you need Toto not the map raw data

00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,990
and then by using one of the available

00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:58,349
imagery layers to draw the shape of the

00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,210
robot after you finished drawing the

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:04,139
shape of the road you need to add

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:06,360
appropriate Highway tag with an

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,909
appropriate value if you are not sure

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,300
what value to choose for the highway tag

00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:15,860
we suggest to check out the night bar

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:20,570
who the roads and use a one-off on a

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:25,940
similar Road classification for the road

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:30,870
after you finish adding the road you

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:33,390
should also close the tiles based on

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,669
which you edited the roads and this can

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:40,169
be done from the improviser missing

00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,320
roads or panel I think this is all for

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,440
the

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,690
demo and we will have also tomorrow

00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,769
missing rods workshop if you're

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:53,709
interested in helping or adding those of

00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:57,970
missing locations to demand Dvorak will

00:08:53,709 --> 00:09:02,620
be in Mathematica you see room starting

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:07,029
on 2:00 p.m. and I think this is all for

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:10,690
my side Wow type a presentation all

00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:12,930
right so who's staying for tomorrow for

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,949
routing day who's staying for tomorrow

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,810
people all right you're gonna drill her

00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:19,000
with questions okay and if you have a

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:31,540
question you can find me at the Talon of

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:35,290

are you all set Jeremy geed worked when

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,230
I moved to Switzerland it was the Swiss

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:10,449
keyboard so much fun does anybody do

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:13,649
German keyboard huh you want to come

00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,620
sorry

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,779
not a QWERTY keyboard let me try that so

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,420
not the nationality just the style got

00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:24,990

friends make friends

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:47,380
nice the setting did not match the

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,380
labeling that never happened

00:10:50,110 --> 00:11:02,140
should we make him the same for tech

00:10:52,250 --> 00:11:04,340
support and it caused trouble all right

00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,050
fortunately somebody didn't show up for

00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:10,720
his lightning talk so I'm gonna be kind

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:13,990
to Lena and de-seed in terms of timings

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,990
sorry Ilya

00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,700
[Music]

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:32,940
hello everyone I'm site from memory

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:35,370
today I will talk about how verifying

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:39,720
machine generate data for better Maps

00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:43,260
works for map 3 so we are using human to

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:47,610
verify and help map 3 algorithm to

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:49,710
improve data accuracy and this is how my

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,100
plate works probably you are familiar

00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:55,920
with the memory so contributor networks

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,100
collect imageries then collected

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,680
imageries are used to build 3d model of

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,030
the cities and after traffic signs

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,910
recognition and operably

00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:09,090
object recognition produce map feature

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,160
and we are extracting map data from city

00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:13,140
level imagery so mapper is a

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,100
collaborative state level imagery

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:20,070
platform where you can extract map data

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:26,070
powered by machine learning and computer

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:28,920
vision and this is how human in the loop

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:31,680
for works for map 3 so we are collecting

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,680
street-level imageries and those state

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,950
level images are attacked by community

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:41,190
and annotate the object and this train

00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:44,640
our algorithm and help us to detect

00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:48,600
objects and after we detect objects we

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:53,730
are asking to human to verify if those

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:56,550
objects are detected we verify detected

00:12:53,730 --> 00:13:00,360
perfectly and then we are getting this

00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:01,500
feedback from community and then train

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,380
our AI

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:09,510
again and then this improves our data

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:13,560
accuracy and this is our verification

00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:16,320
tool which helps us to remove false

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,960
positives and false negatives as you can

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,950
see it's very user friendly tool and you

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:25,440
can just see the detected object and if

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,780
it is detected correctly you can just

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,600
thumbs up

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:32,890
if it is not the detective correctly you

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,800
just thumbs down so this helps us to

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:40,880
train our algorithm better and as you

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,920
can see did we detect it correctly so

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,650
this is verification example for manhole

00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,330
and as you see like there is a circle on

00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:50,600
the dashboard of the car which is

00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:54,350
detected as a manhole so we can ask the

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:58,370
human to verify if the objects are very

00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:00,680
detected correctly and it's gamification

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,050
too we have a leaderboard and you can

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,520
see all the your verification on the

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:10,820
leaderboard okay so this is one example

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:15,380
for verification project which we have

00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:17,510
done for Istanbul and those yellow

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:21,820
points represent manholes

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:25,130
which are yeah which are reactive

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:28,250
yeah those yellow points represent

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,460
detected manholes in the each imageries

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:34,580
and then so these are the positions of

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:39,290
the images for each images then if we

00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:42,440
move to map feature so those objects

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:49,180
which represent manholes it means that

00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:52,250
those map features are easy to sorry

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,430
yeah these are representing manholes and

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,740
it means that those map feature can be

00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,589
extracted as a map position because they

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:04,339
are detected in three different imagery

00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:09,770
so we can 3d reconstruct and extract

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:12,380
their positions and yeah and how the

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:16,910
data helps enhance OpenStreetMap so you

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:19,910
can import our map features to OS m also

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:23,150
there is traffic sign overlay on OS m ID

00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:26,720
editor and George M so you can easily go

00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:31,640
and contribute map 3 so this is a this

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:34,760
is a way how you can import OS m yeah

00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:38,240
I'm out of time one minute ok so these

00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,230
are the project examples so those purple

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,070
circles rupees

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:46,070
menthols and i just import usm and after

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:49,640
i can verify as a human

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:51,830
if the manholes are positions correctly

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:56,510
and then after i can add them to awesome

00:15:51,830 --> 00:16:00,290
with using man-made manhole tag and this

00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:02,900
is how the objects are represented on

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:06,590
the memory overlay so we can extract

00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:11,780
more than 42 map feature and share with

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:13,370
the OSM community and yeah recently we

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:17,450
are running a global verification

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:19,310
project so there is a tiny link if you

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,530
want to join our global verification

00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:24,320
project you can just give a try our

00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:27,770
verification tool and then help us to

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,580
train our a to provide better quality

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:34,220
map data for community so if you want to

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,050
reach me you can just approach or sell

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:42,560
me that meal mail thank you very much

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:44,240
for listening so do you have a prize

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,610
today you know something away what's

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,690
that about I'm sorry like we have a

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:54,020
camera rustle today 3:30 so if you want

00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:56,510
to join you can just fill up the Google

Documents form on our Twitter accounts

00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,810
so see you at the raffle we have a lot

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,760
of swags to share with you all right

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,530
free stuff free stuff all right

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,410
so we are still missing subrata is

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:13,880
anybody seen him last call

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:17,060
okay so Elina here's your microphone we

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,110
might have time for speakers maybe one

00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:25,010
question at the end go ahead hello so

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:27,680
hello guys so my name is Alena I'm going

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:33,140
to present today how to create notation

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:35,690
for navigation okay Who am I well I work

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,020
at enough well I'm coordinating the

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:44,600
labeling efforts to create data sets for

00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:46,940
our machine learning algorithm the first

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,950
question that pops up is wise data

00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,260
notation important for machine learning

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,330
models

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:56,020
well machine learning models rely on

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,240
date annotations so we are TeleNav what

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,360
we want is to detect references in

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,360
images to do this we will need the

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,530
manual add annotation to be done for our

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,450
object detection algorithm so what we

00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:13,809
have done is that we used our open

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:17,200
street cam imagery and we developed our

00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:20,230
own annotation tool to manually label

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,470
the signs this tool allows us to draw

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:26,559
bounding boxes and to classify each sign

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:29,350
with its correct category also this

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:33,190
annotation tool is available for anyone

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:40,000
and everyone can contribute and the

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:42,490
label signs ok so this is how an image

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,520
should look like it should be it should

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,140
have all the traffic signs labeled so

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,020
that the machine learning algorithm

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:55,270
these signs and make prediction in

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:57,520
millions of images ok so what was the

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,919
biggest challenge to do this well the

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,000
biggest challenge was to create a clean

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,610
dataset with a team of 20 people ok

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,900
so challenge accepted let's see how how

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:12,730
we've done it so we are TeleNav use this

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,520
year we followed these important steps

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:18,190
so first of all we decided which signs

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,250
are important for navigation and created

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:24,309
a library of sign we invested a lot of

00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:28,480
time in this by searching for official

00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:30,910
documents and making sure that each sign

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:35,200
that was important for navigation was in

00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:38,200
the library we also created a clear set

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,990
of rules that each team member should

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,120
follow this set of rules should include

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:46,240
how to label the data what should be

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,210
labeled what not should be labeled we

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,510
also started all this work with a small

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:55,840
sample for example when we approach a

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:58,570
new area we reviewed a few trips and we

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,240
made sure that those trips were reviewed

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:04,550
at least by these two people in this

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,490
this way we made sure that the rules

00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:10,400
were clear and that everyone knows what

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,950
to do also when we came across a certain

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,260
sign and we weren't sure if that sign

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,270
should be labeled or not we had the

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,300
possibility to add the nut short

00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:23,120
category so after a period of time we

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:26,870
will review those natural cases and

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,360
decide what to do with them we also

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,180
identified errors and patterns in data

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,300
sets because of course with human make

00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:38,660
errors and that's not a problem but we

00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:40,910
need to correct them so to do this or

00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,160
did pay all our detections are stored in

00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,380
the database so you suppose these

00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:49,370
queries to identify these patterns and

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:51,800
after that we correct them one more

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:54,080
important thing is that you must keep in

00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:57,050
mind what is the purpose of your work so

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,390
when we came across design in Australia

00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:02,480
we knew right from the beginning that we

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:06,400
need to label all its sub components so

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,290
that the sign was interpreted correctly

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,050
here is some of the work that we've done

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:14,390
in Auckland and Melbourne we use here a

00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:17,390
small trick what we saw is that the

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,550
science in Auckland and Melbourne were

00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,220
very similar to the science in the

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:24,590
United States we had the Train machine

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,420
learning model for the United States so

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,960
what we've done is that we run that

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:32,630
model on images in Australia and New

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,550
Zealand how'd this help us well we

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,370
didn't have to go blindly through search

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:41,180
for certain science we went right on

00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:43,730
spot and we validated and invalidated

00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:47,840
the protections to create a new data set

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:50,330
for this region and some states what we

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,640
managed to do we built for machine

00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:55,280
learning models in one and a half years

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,030
for the United States Australia New

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:02,600
Zealand in Europe we labeled about

00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:05,390
600,000 image sorry we labeled about six

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,350
and we had about 600,000 labels and

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,620
labeled

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,539
over 400,000 images and our machine

00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:15,679
learning model started was able to

00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:17,720

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,520
question awesome

I like people can help me with that

we're gonna end on time though I promise

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,549
okay great we have kind of panel here so

00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,380
I have a general question unfortunately

00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:02,510
we don't have mapillary guy that

00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:06,799
actually that would be for him mostly

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:10,760
and the question is or or idea is that

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,830
there is such things that too much data

00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,530
I think telling of is nice in this sense

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:19,309
that all the Stags micro tracks are not

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:23,450
uploaded to OpenStreetMap my pillar is

00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:25,850
even uploading this back and as old-time

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:28,820
importer I have imported most of the

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:32,030
data for my country like ten plus years

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:34,669
ago and this is in kind of sad state

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,900
because I see that nobody is updating it

00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:38,240
it is too detailed

00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:42,620
and this data becomes overtime

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:45,350
unmaintainable so the challenge with is

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,059
too much data is that okay it is nice

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,450
you can filter out your relevant things

00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:53,059
but if nobody will later on taking care

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,440
of that then this will become more and

00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:58,100
more garbage sorry

00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:02,240
so my question or idea or proposal will

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:05,690
be to think seriously about the data

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,120
retention policy how and when we will

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,400
delete the data once we see that it is

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,140
actually not maintained so it was

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,590
relevant some time ago but especially

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:18,789
this micro data

00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:23,230
we'll become quite problematic over a

00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:27,399
few years super thanks so I do not leave

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:33,370
you guys a mic do you have comments here

00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:37,539
a what I wanted to say is that if we

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:40,539
have in some regions more fresh data we

00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:43,149
always run all algorithm and if it's it

00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:47,320
as something just different we will take

00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:49,630
action so we make sure that map is up to

00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:56,590
date I don't know if that answers your

00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:59,529
question maybe you can answer it in the

00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:02,260
break is that alright any other

00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:06,429
questions I can take one more all right

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:12,190
I'm gonna make a run upstairs I can't do

00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:15,190
it I have hope but can you stand the

00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:17,380
talk like this thank you

00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:21,880
you mentioned there's a tool where you

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:24,130
can label the signs yes do you have an

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,940
URL or something you can share

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:31,840
sorry if I have a link somewhere yes yes

00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:34,149
I didn't write it but you can it's in
