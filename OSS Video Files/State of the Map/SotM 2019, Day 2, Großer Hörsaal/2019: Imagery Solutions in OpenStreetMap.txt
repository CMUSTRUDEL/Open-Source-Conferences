Title: 2019: Imagery Solutions in OpenStreetMap
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	Satellite imagery has materially enhanced OpenStreetMap and improved editing and validation. In this talk we will talk about recent enhancements we've made to get even more information from satellite imagery.

DigitalGlobe, now known as Maxar Technologies, has been providing two sources of imagery directly for OpenStreetMap (OSM) users for tracing and validating. Over the past couple years, we’ve received a lot of excellent feedback from OSM users and we are making a few changes to better serve OSM volunteers. Part of this presentation will address some of the common questions we are asked, address some of the common feedback, and dive into the upcoming changes to the services that we provide. We want to do this to clear up any confusion or future questions the community might have. 

We will further demonstrate how we have integrated Maxar imagery into the OpenStreetMap ecosystem.  In both iD and JOSM, we have developed a custom plugin that connects to the commercial satellite imagery service and provides a carousel view of available imagery in the visual extent of the editor.  Images are arranged temporally providing opportunities to compare areas against different time periods.  The plugin also applies the metadata from the image as tags on the feature, including source:imagery, source:imagery:layerName, source:imagery:sensor, and source:imagery:date. Leveraging these services and applying the metadata of the imagery enhances the mapping experience, enriches OSM data, and improves the end-user benefits.

so we have a swap-out our friend Kevin

00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:16,059
Bullock is not here today but we have a

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,230
guest Kevin also known as Maggie oh do

00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,550
you only use my Michael you're playing

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,550
for that help you got it

00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:31,960
super alright thank you very much

00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,079
Heather like Heather said if you came

00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,030
here and you know Kevin Bullock you

00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,729
probably figured out by now that I am

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,760
NOT Kevin Bullock unfortunately you can

00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:46,600
make it but I'm going to do my best to

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,629
fill his shoes so my name is is Matthew

00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:55,659
Gibb I work at max R and I'm based out

00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:59,079
of Washington DC in the US so before we

00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:01,089
dive too far into things I sort of want

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:05,799
to talk about the elephant in the room I

00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:08,049
am NOT a statistician nor am I like an

00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,340
M&E specialist but I have spoken to

00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:12,040
quite a few people here over the past

00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,770
several days between the hot summit and

00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,540
the events here at state of the map and

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,920
you know some people have known for

00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,140
years some people in just meeting for

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,730
the first time so I think I've got a

00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:27,820
pretty good sample size and there

00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,920
there's one question that has been at

00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,390
the forefront of most people's minds so

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,220
it wouldn't surprise me if that's that's

00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,630
why you're here today okay somebody from

00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,720
Matt's ours here and I really want to

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:41,920
hear from the horse's mouth and that

00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:45,220
question is did we plan this so this is

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,670
down downtown you're allowed to laugh

00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:51,490
it's okay if you don't my kids don't

00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,770
either so it's fine it's just a bar in

00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,800
the old city

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,780
max bar I thought it was funny um but

00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,100
but really the debate the big question

00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,010
everybody's sort of asking and I've

00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,140
probably answered a dozen times the past

00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:08,229
several days is is what happened to Max

00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,750
our and where did DigitalGlobe go so

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,819
that's technically two questions but

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:17,510
let's let's talk about it

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,879
I don't want to go as far back and with

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,670
my story as doctors that did yesterday

00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,650
with the history of the University but I

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,650
will start in some some simpler days

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,950
before the gdpr

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:33,920
before Avengers infinity war before the

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,230
tide pod challenge and before the last

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,970
thing that have Game of Thrones way way

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:43,849
back in 2017 MDA Holdings and digital

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:48,470
globe merged to create a new company

00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:51,919
Mac's arm and that created these four

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:54,200
separate businesses operating all under

00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,049
the Mac's our name but retaining their

00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:01,340
legacy so there is SSL digital globe

00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:04,040
radiance solutions and MDA so for a

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,379
little over the over a year these four

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,919
companies operated as separate business

00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:12,049
units keeping their names and areas of

00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,370
expertise but ultimately it was

00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:16,549
determined that we could work better

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,299
together and and it made sense to become

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:23,120
one Macs are but one thing hasn't

00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:25,159
changed we we still want to be able to

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,579
provide insights about our changing

00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:34,699
planet where and when it matters and an

00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:37,940
OpenStreetMap certainly matters so to

00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:40,430
get into things there have been some

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,190
changes and of course change means

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,440
saying goodbye to some things so if you

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,840
haven't noticed already as of July 1st

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,609
the digital globe premium and standard

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,040
imagery services are now gone but that

00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:57,169
means the Macs are premium and standard

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,389
image imagery services are here and I'll

00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:05,139
talk to you about some of the changes

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:09,349
and benefits of that next oops

00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:11,180
and another farewell is for the map box

00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:14,709
aerial imagery that had previously been

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:17,030
incorporated into the DG premium service

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,470
that was mainly in major cities where

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,060
there was aerial imagery available if

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,880
you reached a high enough zoom level

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,760
you'd notice a transition to aerial

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:31,780
imagery that is no longer

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:34,000
the the Macs are premium service so some

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,700
of the new updates to the max our

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,770
imagery services it's going to be

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,720
exclusively satellite imagery with a

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,180
spatial resolution between 30 and 50

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,590
centimeters the previous DG services

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:51,070
ranged anywhere from 30 to 60 and there

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:53,170
is some shift as everybody's I'm sure

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:57,100
experiences and that's to be expected

00:04:53,170 --> 00:05:00,190
usually it's around 2 to 3 meters if

00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,770
you're using you know ID or Jocelyn you

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,800
can use the imagery offsets Johnston has

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,200
a great plugin for the imagery offset

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,440
database we can actually share offsets

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,330
with other mappers so so that way

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,930
everyone is is working with a similar

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:19,720
offset and we're also planning on

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,850
pushing updates more frequently in some

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:29,760
places that that can be up to two or

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:33,400
three times a year so there there's also

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:37,510
a good amount of work left to do for

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:41,710
these services first is around updates

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:44,400
if there's a particular area that hasn't

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:48,520
been updated or the quality isn't great

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,310
please reach out and we can we can try

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,870
and figure out what's going on I'll

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,200
provide some contact information at the

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,020
end to reach out to Kevin he he'll be

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,900
the best person to help you with that

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,360
and another question I've been asked

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,610
quite a bit as well when is the imagery

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,430
from right that's that's very important

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:13,840
so you may recall that with the DG

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:16,810
services there there was a vintage layer

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,350
that was available in addition to the

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,150
actual image image layer so that's not

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,180
yet available for the Mac sorry imagery

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:28,060
but it is coming or we're working on

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,130
restoring that we we we recognize the

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:35,050
importance of knowing when you're

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:37,000
looking at right and that could end up

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,500
not not knowing that information could

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,360
end up turning a mapper

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,790
away because they don't know the date

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,060
that which their their mapping or if it

00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,800
might not be recent enough so that that

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,200
vintage service it's a couple months

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,760
away but we have the data we want to

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:57,540
make it happen we're just figuring out

00:06:51,760 --> 00:07:00,280
the the best way to do so um so that's

00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:04,210
largely the updates on the imagery

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:08,770
services but the other part of this talk

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:11,919
was around another sort of proof of

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,840
concept that we've been playing with it

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,180
hasn't been implemented anywhere but I

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:21,070
just wanted to sort of share some of the

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:23,230
details with you so like I mentioned

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,000
earlier we're working on getting the the

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:28,660
vintage layer for the Macs our imagery

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,510
service available to the community and

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,230
while all that while that vintage layer

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,450
may ultimately be available ultimately

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:41,010
mappers are going to be limited to

00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:44,410
what's available in the preset base maps

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,630
we've been investigating the use of WMS

00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,970
and and and web feature services to

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,150
automatically add feature tags as part

00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,460
of an image category with values based

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:57,520
on the image metadata things like

00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,550
imagery date sensor or the mosaic that

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,680
it's from so the benefit of this being

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,919
additional attribution and context for a

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,390
feature informing users not only when

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,030
the feature was created but also the

00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:14,650
source of from which the source of the

00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:16,750
imagery from which it was mapped so we

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,460
began looking into this with the

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,870
landfall of Hurricane Harvey back in

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:25,990
2017 and in Houston Texas what we did in

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:31,270
our own forked version of ID we added

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:33,880
three WMS and and wfs pairs to to this

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:37,320
version of ID to the data slash imagery

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,849
JSON that's that's available in ID and

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,080
with two sources of pre event imagery

00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:45,580
and and one source of post event imagery

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,930
you know we wanted to be able to compare

00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:52,630
you know mapping a feature before the

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:56,440
before the event and then being able to

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:58,960
use that metadata after the event so

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,750
what basically happens is when ideas

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,650
initialized the wfs is loaded locally

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,830
into memory

00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:10,020
the wfs can also be queried on each zoom

00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:13,930
or pan as well when that overlays

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,390
selected the wfs metadata features are

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,930
are loaded again being the date the

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:22,420
sensor and mosaic and when that feature

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:26,410
has created the metadata is retrieved

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:32,530
from the WSS and added as tags to the

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:34,810
feature here's just an example again

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:40,990
over Houston showing the WMS of the

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:44,560
event related imagery being loaded into

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:46,300
memory indicating that the console that

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,340
the feature services are present and

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:53,740
that they were loaded sort of as part of

00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:58,830
the proof-of-concept so you can see you

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,830
can see the wfs grid there

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:11,790
and here's your typical example of

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,160
feature creation and ID we dropped the

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:17,640
point and added the feature tag in this

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,550
case me minigolf not not sure about you

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:27,630
but the dogleg on 17 looks looks pretty

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:30,480
rough the golf joke oh and here's the

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:35,160
example showing the WMS of the event

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,650
related imagery from from the WF s so in

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,510
the the the features added the w FS

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,420
allows the source tags to be transferred

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:45,300
on to the feature allowing for users to

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:48,900
identify the date of which feature is

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,500
mapped let it go through again so you

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,500
can see

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:13,160
so there's the imagery metadata so so

00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:16,220
how does this impact OpenStreetMap

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,020
though we're able to look at a single

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,090
image and get the source metadata added

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,430
to the features but how do we allow for

00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,830
the imagery mosaics to allow for this

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,940
metadata to be passed at a at a global

00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,880
scale

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:32,750
we we want to be able to accommodate

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,420
mosaic imagery references almost all osm

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:38,990
users are mapping with an imagery mosaic

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:41,660
so we really need to scale it up

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,600
of course geometry matters the azimuthal

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,940
angle of the center of the platform all

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,580
play a role in the resulting satellite

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,200
image but it would ultimately allow the

00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:55,210
end-user to discern it additional

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,210
information about the features and

00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,420
they're not obviously need to be

00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,710
discussion around attribution needs as

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,930
well as the standardization of the

00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:06,770
source tags it's not something you just

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:08,270
implement and make everybody have the

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:11,270
the metadata tags there's obviously need

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:14,390
to be discussion around it and to to

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,740
work with the practice within OS m this

00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,630
is there was really just a proof of

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:24,380
concept that we thought would be called

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:27,530
it cool to share so what what what's the

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,850
time of the image you use is another

00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,770
question you know are you using the

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,190
local time of where the image was

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:35,540
captured or using UTC time which might

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,930
be more useful to a more global

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,910
community if you're if you're looking at

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,430
things that a and want to know a

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,300
specific time it's a question you need

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,490
an answer

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,830
and so there's no other questions and

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,470
and and details to be straightened out

00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,050
but there's definitely a benefit to be

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:59,180
had for adding additional metadata add a

00:12:54,050 --> 00:13:02,090
feature at a feature level so thank you

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,400
very much for your time I am open to

00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:06,530
some questions about the presentation

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,600
I'm not necessarily an expert on the

00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,820
imagery topic but I'm happy to chat with

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,270
you or take down your question so that

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,970
we can get an answer for you

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:19,180
after the conference I have Kevin's OSM

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:22,570
username here he's a great resource to

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:32,260
reach out to if you have any specific

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:38,380
questions on on this work does anybody

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:41,290
have any questions for Matt Thomas I'm

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,750
just gonna move by you I appreciate that

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,760
someone's gonna break the ice and make

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,620
me run but I'm missing my second cup of

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,620
coffee it's not gonna be pretty

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,610
thanks for your talking for providing

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,770
the imagery I think the media did are

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,590
extremely important and what is the

00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:03,970
support for other editors as a generic

00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:06,760
format you provide the metadata the

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:09,670
support for other editors as a generic

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,880
format to provide the meta data is there

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:18,880
a generic format for retrieving the

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:22,210
metadata I'm not entirely sure mately it

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,990
would depend on the the WSS that we

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:28,630
created so for this it was just this one

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:33,580
test case over Houston and it was you

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:37,060
saw the the grid that was created so it

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,860
would depend on the the imagery service

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,980
itself if we were to scale it up looking

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,530
at an entire mosaic there there it would

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,990
be important for there to be you know a

00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,940
standard set of tags and metadata and

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,260
then that's why I mentioned you know

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:55,150
having the discussion with the community

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:58,830
before even thinking about making this

00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,850
something that's available everywhere

00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,550
super we have another question but I'm

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,530
looking for Sayid and sobota

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:09,700
who have who are gonna be giving it when

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,330
I talks are you here no we're gonna lose

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,470
their spots

00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:16,900
Christa yeah what I wanted to emphasize

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,720
on what the previous question was about

00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,250
I would suggest to you to reach out to

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,200
the

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:26,690
developers of other interests an idea

00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:29,100
about how to best make the concept and

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,500
what their requirements would be it

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,420
would be great to involve all because

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,710
many of the people who work off it from

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:41,940
this features are using US aid at us my

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:45,720
question was you also recording stereo

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,980
images for much of the directions and if

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,020
there any plans to make

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,930
three-dimensional data derived from

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,300
stereo imaging to the OSM community

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,010
formatting so just to make sure I'm

00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:00,530
hearing right is there any intention to

00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:03,840
add more stereo imagery available in OSM

00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:07,980
stage amici it says it's not that much

00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:11,510
interest okay can you repeat the

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,510
question now without the microphone I

00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,850
Oh Pete the question yeah so the

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,690
question was is there any intention to

00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,690
release

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,389
features could be mapped within OSM I

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,329
don't know the answer to that question

00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:55,579
but I'll run it down and I'll get that

00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:56,329
to Kevin thank you how to reach

00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:59,899
Christophe

00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:01,329
I'm sorry sorry who doesn't have his

00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:04,939
email address

00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:06,470
seriously warmly Christophe the most

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:07,909
engaged we should have you ever done the

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,059
math and the mainland this is to the

00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:14,419
percentage of emails alright so I'm

00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:17,510
still looking for Syed subrata subrata

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:20,089
and Illya for an egg talks

00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:32,090
nope alright and questions next

00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:35,210
questions for our friend hello

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:37,789
so in the slide you said that there will

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:41,450
be places that is that are gonna be

00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:44,090
updated twice a year how about let's say

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:47,029
a general minimum like there will no

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:50,750
there will be imagery older than one

00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:54,620
year two years old Alex the plan I'm not

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,720
sure about that if anyone didn't hear

00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:59,330
the question was in some places may be

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,980
updated two times a year but what's

00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,730
what's the minimum is it gonna be you

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:08,000
know once a year or two years or horror

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:12,679
I don't I don't know the exact number

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,380
but Holmes passed that to Kevin oh I'll

00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,590
make sure Kevin cluck season sorry these

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,320
questions and shares them out broadly

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:27,140
because I'm sure a lot of people have

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:30,260
similar questions thank you I'm at based

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,320
on building off that question is there

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:36,020
any intention to let people know when

00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:40,630
and where layers will be updated or is

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,630
it just gonna be that magical black box

00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:48,140
so I'm not entirely sure so when in

00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:50,919
winning where imagery will be updated I

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:54,830
I dunno we will have the vintage layer

00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:58,100
about when when the image was updated

00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,940
but in terms of you know what's what's

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,560
in the pipeline

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,020
I don't know part of that depends on the

00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:06,740
available imagery sometimes there's not

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:10,880
as much imagery over an area but I'll

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:14,720
ask Kevin as well thank you are there

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,400
any other questions for Matt once twice

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,200
Matt are you gonna be here the rest of

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,900
me I will be here the rest of the day

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,730
I'll be here all day tomorrow okay so

00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,040
two more days to drill it with questions

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,350
in person and he can write them down who

00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,690
doesn't know it great so thank you Matt

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,690
