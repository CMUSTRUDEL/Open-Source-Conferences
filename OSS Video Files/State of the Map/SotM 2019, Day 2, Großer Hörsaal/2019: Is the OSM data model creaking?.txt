Title: 2019: Is the OSM data model creaking?
Publication date: 2019-09-28
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 2, Großer Hörsaal
Description: 
	The OSM data model has facilitated rapid growth of community-created geodata which third parties can build on. But as more accuracy is needed in routing, cartography, and other uses, is this data model good enough? We are trying to represent spaces as flows, which result in fundamental compromises and inaccuracies. This talk will discuss real-world cases where this compromise is increasingly problematic.

OpenStreetMap was designed to enable ordinary people to create open geodata that anyone can use and maintain easily. Traditional GIS concepts such as layers are dispensed with in order to make editing simple and accessible. In the same way that the web would never have taken off if HTML were not so accessible and tolerant of mistakes, this simplicity in OSM has meant a low barrier to involvement.

However, as OSM is becoming more widely used in the mainstream, the need for accuracy and quality is becoming more and more important. Cyclists need detailed turn data to enable high-quality routing that takes full account of safety. Satnav companies, need lane data, which is difficult to represent accurately. Pedestrian routing is barely in its infancy and high quality routing for people walking or using wheelchairs is hard to achieve.

At its root, OSM tries to represent spaces as flows (lines). This results in fundamental compromises and inaccuracies. What is good for routing is not always good for cartography, and vice-versa.

For instance, a street containing cycleways with pavements either side is usually represented as a single line with attributes. However, it is extremely challenging to represent properly all the parts of the street, and in general people simply don't bother: a single line with large numbers of attributes is unwieldy to edit (even when hidden by editor GUIs), and just as challenging for a router to interpret. Continual changes in the width of a street cannot be easily represented without segmenting the street heavily and creating a mess. Temporary disappearance of lanes makes editing complex. Routing ultimately ends up as a lowest common denominator result.

The alternative method of representing this same street is as a series of individual lines. But this is equally problematic. In this model, the street loses its coherence as a single entity - humans think of it as a street with multiple uses (walking, cycling, driving, trees). Where people have done this, attributes such as street names need to be kept in sync, and in practice separate pavements often fail to have names attached. Concepts such as the ability to cross from one side of the road to the other (or even switch lanes) are not modelled, with the result that a router may take the user to the end of the street then back down. And cartography ends up showing a series of parallel lines which looks messy and does not match the human perception of a street.

The bicycle tagging page on OSM provides a perfect demonstration of the current problem:
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bicycle
It shows the complexity of representing many common scenarios, with increasingly incomprehensible tagging combinations. No router implements anything like all of this, and even expert OSM contributors would shy away at bothering to add this data.

Cycleways indeed are a good general example of inconsistent tagging. Cycleways separate to a road are sometimes tagged as an attribute of the street and sometimes as a separate geometry. What about a hybrid/stepped cycle lane of the kind seen in Copenhagen - is that a cycle lane or a cycleway? Do lane counts include cycle lanes or not? How is obstructive car parking represented? Is the one-way indication applicable to the cycle lane on the road? And so on.

Another example is junctions. Should traffic signals be treated spatially (i.e. represent the location of the traffic heads), or should they be treated linearly so that routing works properly? How should the linear model work accurately when there is only a single geometry for multiple directions? Have a look at the roads around the Arc De Triomphe in Paris - it is completely impossible for a routing engine to work out exactly how many signal delays should actually be attributed based on the presence of the marking of traffic signals in the data:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/48.87391/2.29536

This talk will discuss these cases, and provide a starting point for discussion on what should be done to improve the situation. As people are ever keener to add more detail to the map, and as more and more mainstream users look to OSM, we have to ask whether the current model is arguably creaking too heavily. Is there a way that we can represent spaces as a set of interconnected flows in some way?

hello everyone thank you very much for

00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,250
coming I'm Martin

00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:17,140
Lucas Smith I'm one of the developers of

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,750
cycle streets which is one of the

00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,019
earliest routing projects and we started

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,460
in in 2008 and it's it's great to be

00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:27,820
here again and thank you all for coming

00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,860
to this talk I've been using Open Street

00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,480
Map for a long time now obviously and I

00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,070
spend a lot of time looking at the data

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,000
model and how we root over it and how

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,329
cartographically is represented as well

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,819
and and I believe that the time has come

00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:45,819
to look at the data model and say are we

00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:47,530
missing a certain couple of concepts and

00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:49,300
because I think there are things that

00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,149
are actually quite hard to do and there

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:56,049
are compromises that we have and in the

00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:58,269
model so just briefly and background and

00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,799
like let's just say we start in 2008 we

00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:02,589
have a rather old looking website which

00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:04,629
will be improved shortly but most of our

00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:07,290
routing millions millions per month

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,820
comes through our data interface or API

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,010
so for example you're in London you

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,800
probably heard of citymapper which is

00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:17,710
users routing from us and we have a

00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,070
whole range of routing API sorry routing

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,580
makes it be circular routing user

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:27,660
management infrastructure or auditing

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,010
photographs GPS tracking and so on and

00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,350
again briefly just before I get into the

00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,450
actual such as my talk and the routing

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,160
engine that we've we've developed over

00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,380
the last ten years covers different

00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,990
types of routing from a quiet route a

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,330
fastest route and a sort of balanced

00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,740
bicycle route between the two we have

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,660
hundreds of rules that we kind of

00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,060
combined to sort of emulate how a

00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,550
cyclist thinks as they move around and

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,800
we look in detail at the infrastructure

00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,020
so for example a slight lane that's

00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,640
narrow we often give a negative score to

00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,290
your on positive score because actually

00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,500
that can encourage people to drive

00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,060
closely and we analyze every Junction so

00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,120
things like left turns and right turns

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,220
are handled differently we have the

00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,120
engine covers different elevation and

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,650
sources which combined and smoothes out

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,060
resample and so on and we have full

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,499
support for route relations so we're

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,110
trying to get a really good modelling of

00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:22,000
cycling

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,440
so I think for me the fundamental

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,450
problem is that we're trying to

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,680
represent the real world which is a

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,600
space as lines and I think there are

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,840
lots of compromises that come as a

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:39,400
result of this of this sort of

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,560
approximation of the world and so I'm

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,240
going to go through various examples of

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,209
how the sort of problem I think that

00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,430
comes from this and then offer a couple

00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:51,190
of suggestions and these are by no means

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,840
to finalize the ideas as such but they

00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,620
at least I hope that we will start a

00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:00,820
discussion within the community so here

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:04,750
we have the tunnel in Amsterdam and

00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:06,580
going onto the the main railway and as

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,739
you can see it's one as I call it

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,959
conceptual space it's a tunnel through

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,750
which people travel but it has multiple

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,540
flows on the left on the left we

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,660
obviously have a foot way which is has a

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,810
surface it's five meters wide and on the

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,840
right we have a multi-directional

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:29,049
cycleway and which is segregated from

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,320
the pavement how is this represented in

00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:36,730
OpenStreetMap well it's represented as

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,890
two tunnels and the one on the left is

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,890
that's not highlighted is the cycleway

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,660
and it has the name as you can see on

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,940
the on the map just on the top right

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,220
there you can see it has the name and it

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,580
has attributes like its surface and so

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,680
on

00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,049
and on the right hand side we have the

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,519
foot the foot way which is separately

00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:58,600
marketers of tunnels there are two

00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,310
tunnels apparently and and it doesn't

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,500
have a name so if you're doing

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,480
pedestrian routing you now have the art

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,350
you now have the task of associating the

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,930
name of the cycleway

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,810
with the adjacent foot way which is not

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,519
always a very easy GIS task particularly

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:17,200
depending how you face splits out the

00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:21,910
way so here is an example from Cambridge

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:25,360
Riley this is a seven lane highway and

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,940
there are two lanes of traffic there is

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,800
a single directional cycle lane on one

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,270
side

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,940
there is another single directional

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,610
cycle lane on the other side there is

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,930
then a contra fire on the left if you

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,050
can see the pavements has then got a

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,610
contra flow cycle way and on the right

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,270
hand side there's a pavement so there

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,120
are there are seven separate flows here

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,639
how do we represent this

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,979
well we're difficulty I think but this

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,419
is what the real world is like and okay

00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,979
you don't always have a contraflow but

00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,639
if you imagine junctions you can often

00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:01,470
end up with very complicated situations

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,319
so we're trying to do more and more with

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,880
OpenStreetMap you know back in 2008 we

00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,310
wanted to make a map then people wanted

00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,099
routing and then there's analysis and so

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,069
on and we're trying to get a better and

00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:16,560
better and apps and routing that really

00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,909
read you know really is high quality but

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,000
really I think that the model is

00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:23,130
becoming too basic for the real world so

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,280
how do we model this one well here's the

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,349
2009 that's that it's nice and simple

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,229
we have highway equals primary it's a

00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:33,000
main road and we have cycleway equals

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:33,810
track I mean you can debate if this is a

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,719
trap or a line

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:40,560
and that will give you a reasonable

00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:42,900
level of cycler routing sorry the street

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,500
name is Hills Road in Cambridge sorry

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,150
I'll add that to the slides after and so

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,130
this will give you a reasonable level of

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,320
quality but it's clearly not good enough

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,729
for a road sat-nav because you might

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,039
need to how many lanes which lane you're

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,590
in towards the junction and for cycle

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,380
routing we don't know for example is

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,259
this shared with pedestrians how wide is

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,819
it is it possible for a cargo bike user

00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,490
to use it or are they gonna be hopping

00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,409
on the road or whatever so this will

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,300
give us a Goods enough quality but it's

00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:13,650
it's really not not really good enough

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,039
it's not really good enough in my view

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:19,169
so here's the here's the first approach

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,460
that we can take which is that we model

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:26,699
each of the flows are separate lines so

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,889
the one I've selected is the the

00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:33,240
cycleway on the left the the main bit of

00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:35,689
red here and we are actually modeling

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,059
this correctly we've got as a track

00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:40,249
a certain weave at other surface we can

00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:42,019
say that it's segregated this is light

00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:45,259
segregation in this case it's sort of

00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:46,789
halfway and so on and that's fine but as

00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:48,439
you can see we've now ended up with four

00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:50,989
bits of hill we've now ended up with

00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:55,189
four hills roads there are four lines on

00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:58,099
there and there are kind of lots of odds

00:06:55,189 --> 00:07:00,229
of problems that then result and so

00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,879
routing can ends up with like this and

00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:03,439
we're basically because there isn't

00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,829
actually a crossing in the middle of the

00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,779
road and someone sort of half drawn on a

00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:10,689
spurt sought to one side of it you can

00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:13,279
just about see in the middle there's a

00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:15,110
there's a little bit there but it hasn't

00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,449
actually been joining properly and if it

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,769
was that's drawing in a cycle way that

00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:22,519
doesn't actually exist in the middle of

00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:24,709
the road but I mean I'm sure we've all

00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:26,479
come across routing the destron routing

00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,929
that ends up with this sort of sort of

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,449
things

00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:32,659
no one cycles like that in reality you

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:36,439
can cross the road so and the other way

00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:38,239
to do it is the Rob having single the

00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,489
separate lines we can model it as a

00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,469
single light but with lots and lots of

00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:44,989
attributes to represent the parts of the

00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:47,809
road so it has idealist while I look on

00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:49,069
the bicycle page on the wiki I hear a

00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:51,349
few laughs so you've obviously been

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:53,059
there before and it starts off fine

00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:56,509
we've got the nice simple case at the

00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:59,509
top of a road with to a lane either side

00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:01,579
and how it looks like whatever it is and

00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:04,039
slightly because lane that's fine

00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:07,550
and as we scroll down it just gets more

00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:10,489
and more ridiculous you ends up with on

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,800
the Left we've got there a the top left

00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:16,429
we have a a two-lane highway we have a

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,589
cycle lane on the Left we have a cycle

00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:21,319
lane on the right there's then a bus on

00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:22,309
the other side of it and the tack the

00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,089
tacking just gets more and more

00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:28,550
ridiculous and no no no data consumer I

00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:31,159
I'm aware of processes this kind of

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,360
thing and it's we certainly don't and

00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:33,889
I'd like to think that we run probably

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,729
the most advanced cycle routing in the

00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:40,659
world this stuff is just unintelligible

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,309
and it's not a usable data model and

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,990
it's designed of course for edit you

00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:47,059
know for automatic editing software like

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,170
ID where you could potentially have the

00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,269
lane spits out but

00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:55,130
it's still very very subjective being

00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:57,380
broken by by accidental changes and I

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,860
defy anyone to understand what all that

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,079
means

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,389
so anyway going back to my example I had

00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:08,540
a go at it and that's what I came up

00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:11,180
with so we've got access lanes is no no

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,100
no yes yes no no bicycle lanes there's

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,170
no testing later designated yes yes blah

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,300
blah blah blah blah cycle backwards

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,709
tracks like the backward s width and so

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,360
on and I still think there's a problem

00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:23,120
because I can't really represent the

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,660
fact that the the left contraflow is

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,820
that it's that way but again no one is

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,800
going to use this so we essentially have

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,990
two models that neither of which really

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,029
work we have this unified model which is

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,709
theoretically might work but it's very

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:38,510
difficult to understand and know it will

00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,820
break and we have the multiple lanes

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:44,420
model which has its own problems which

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:47,180
I'll talk about and so say we're trying

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:50,269
to represent a space as a set of flows

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,399
and we we therefore have to make

00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:56,089
compromises so one of them is junctions

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,949
so here we have the example of if you

00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:00,140
look on the if you look here you're

00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:02,180
cycling along so this is in the UK sorry

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,519
on the Left I'm afraid but you're

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,410
cycling on here and in theory you have

00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,199
to sort of bare right so that we and

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:11,269
then you get to the you get to the

00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:13,130
traffic light and then you do a bare

00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,500
left so you know you've got to sort of

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,120
you've got to turns you're making and in

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,190
reality this is just a normal straight

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,050
road with the junction with a traffic

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,240
lights in the middle and what's happened

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,390
here is that we're trying to we've made

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,519
this sort of fake shape fake geometry

00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,720
and because we want to represent the

00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,060
fact that cycle lane is going through

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,560
traffic lights now there are other ways

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,230
to do that but they also have their

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,319
their downsides and here's another

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:42,850
example any idea what this is any

00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:42,850
suggestions what the hell this thing is

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:52,950
yes so it's basically a straight road

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,610
it's a straight road with a slight the

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:59,070
lane on and you go through this sort of

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,290
bus gate it is but that's how it looks

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,110
cartographically I mean it's Oakley

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,940
isn't it I mean this this has been

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,350
produced by one of this this map is

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,680
produced by one of the best passports in

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,510
the world in my view but even he would

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,900
it struggles to deal with this kind of

00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,220
data and also routing wise whatwhat are

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,990
the instructions that a cyclist gets

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,210
well they're going along and then they

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,370
talk to bear left they go around and

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,780
it's like a left turn again that's not

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,780
the reality the reality is you go

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,370
straight on so again we how do we

00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,690
represent this stuff properly in the

00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:35,700
real world so following on from that

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,380
here is an example in Manhattan New York

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,690
and quite a few of my examples are from

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,430
Manhattan where I think some of the the

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,250
traffic lights reaching in particular is

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:47,280
particularly bad and we have five first

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,950
avenues and this is not a map that

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,360
really a sort of ordinary person would

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,780
look at and understand what's going on

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,720
here

00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:57,870
now of course what we actually have is a

00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,770
street which has a road in the middle

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:03,300
and there's a cycle cycle lane post

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,550
possibly slightly segregated and

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,620
there're others have put well on the

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:11,340
side but of course the map the actual

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:15,960
cartographic map represents these as

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:19,230
five five lanes so as five lines each of

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,330
which has a name and this is actually

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,890
this is correctly route scible so this

00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,400
works correctly for routing but

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,450
cartography it's completely wrong and I

00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,150
think the problem here is that we don't

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,800
have a clear concept of the street which

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:35,280
is how we as humans think about there

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,410
you know a street is a space with flows

00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,780
and things happening in trees and

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,790
parking and traffic lights and these are

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,740
that similarly we don't have the concept

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,150
of a junction we just have lines and

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,100
connections going through this and

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,270
somehow routing software is supposed to

00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,520
work out that what you're really trying

00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:53,790
to do is just go let go right or left

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,950
and here's another Junction this is

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,840
from Amsterdam which i think is one of

00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:01,500
the highest quality routing in the world

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,480
and it sits beautifully creating exactly

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,940
what happens you know I've been through

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,920
this it is it is correct the problem is

00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,200
if you imagine you're cycling from the

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,520
top and you're so you're sort of

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,320
slightly in that direction and you're

00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,260
trying to get here you're essentially

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,110
doing a right turn but what but if you

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,600
follow the line you're sort of sort of

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,580
going straight on it sort of just goes

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,370
around there so it's straight on that

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,440
way is it that way we want to represent

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,180
that the cyclist should ultimately be

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,970
like a right turn through this overall

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,620
space this mass of a junction but

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,600
there's no reference point we can

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,100
actually say you know you're going to

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,360
this point and this this sort of

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,550
relevant point you're turning right

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,140
essentially but so there's no way of

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,340
telling that this is a job actually a

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,600
junction so you know how do we actually

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,610
give an instruction for cyclists to turn

00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,930
right

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,870
another example is pedestrian routing

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:58,470
and so this is back in Manhattan we have

00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:01,110
a Main Street just check the time and as

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,180
a cycle way now the way that we and this

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:08,190
is a case where inconsistently we don't

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:09,570
have the separate walkways but the

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,490
normal way we do this is to add the

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,710
sidewalk tag to say that there is or

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:16,350
isn't a sidewalk so we not expect to say

00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,630
sidewalk you plus no but if we put this

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,400
side but where should we put that do we

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,190
put the sidewalk equals no on the Main

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,280
Street or on the cycleway well of course

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:29,430
it should be on the Main Street but then

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,450
would a routing engine that would it be

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,560
looking at the soil with a possession

00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,390
routing engine we're looking in the

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,400
cycleway and say oh that's where the

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,680
sidewalk is do you see what I mean it's

00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,240
sort of there's two things and we kind

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,800
of want there we want the sidewalk on

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,230
the right of this bit on the left of

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,420
that there and nothing in the middle

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,950
there so it's another it's another

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,940
compromise where where should the walk

00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:52,410
routine put but the pedestrian another

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,310
example is that can't really properly

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:57,810
model the turns here we have and if you

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,030
imagine you're cycling from here along

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:04,710
this in theory what the route sir says

00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:07,000
is turn right turn right turn left

00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:10,120
what does the cyclist do well they just

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,980
sort of go like that they just meander

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,840
around that corner and again because

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,700
we're trying to we've got all the points

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,150
coming into a single place which correct

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,790
the route ability the connectivity will

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,680
will give us a route but if we can't you

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,240
know dude do we have a fake bit of bike

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,270
route there that doesn't exist I don't

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,770
know what what do we do have and here's

00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,880
another problem how many times do we

00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,640
wait when we're going through this

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,830
Junction well if if we're going from the

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,410
left to the right it says we have a a

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,150
traffic light there's another traffic

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,980
light there now ideally these would have

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,720
a directionality which they don't so

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,220
there's actually two at the moment then

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,890
we also have a crossing and another

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,570
crossing this has two crossings and if

00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:51,100
we'd use the idea so we would have a

00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,660
third cross in here which would have

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,700
been added which in my view we shouldn't

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,200
have so altogether we could and we've

00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,570
actually got two traffic lights and two

00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,560
crossings now a proper route so we'll

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,810
say well a crossing

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,670
you should be slowing down so that you

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,800
know people can cross and traffic light

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,030
you obviously have a wait so we've

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,890
probably got about a minute and a half

00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,330
wait there potentially whereas really

00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,040
what we should have is twenty seconds

00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,530
which is probably what you have to wait

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,120
for the traffic light and now you could

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,380
do some analysis to say well you know

00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,380
these are kind of near each other

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,580
they're probably the same thing but but

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,720
actually you know I've seen traffic

00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,610
lights that are quite near but are a

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,900
separate phase certainly in Cambridge

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,520
there's one where they're about 15

00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,580
meters apart which is the distance

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,900
that's on here so it's very difficult to

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,750
sort of say well what do we have here

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,970
and the Arc de Triomphe is is the worst

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,530
example it is impossible I believe for

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,210
route to work out how long it actually

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,610
takes you to get through this Junction

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,560
it needs a lot of tidying up and it's a

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,120
model that people don't understand when

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,670
they're doing it so we got all these

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,160
lights we've got lots of all the yellow

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,660
dots crossings you get there dear it's

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,310
very difficult to work out what we're

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,889
doing sorry

00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,769
probably not but you know which at least

00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:03,050
try and make it easy for people so it's

00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,179
another example and this is very common

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,069
in in in New York we have a road and

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:11,780
again New York you're supposedly going

00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:13,280
through through two lights another case

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,169
is where the lights are not properly

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,870
managed where you're actually thinking

00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:19,730
about both for cyclists and the road so

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,020
here if you're turning right you

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:25,669
actually have a traffic light there and

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,959
there we can fix this it's this kind of

00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,520
thing where we basically put it in the

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,320
directionality but it's I don't think

00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,940
this is really how humans perceive the

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,470
junction they see it as a junction and

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,150
it just happens to be single heads at

00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,370
certain points but for routability

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,830
that's what we should have I would say

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,510
that about 90 percent of junctions

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,340
invoke certain evolving the site of

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,710
cycling in Manhattan are completely

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,360
wrong they there are vast numbers that

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:51,919
simply have no weight at all for the

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,049
cyclists pedestrian route thing and I

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,490
would say we barely we know any of the

00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:57,409
state-of-the-art unfortunately and

00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,500
because what we're trying to do is to

00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:04,789
represent again the physical locations

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:07,340
of pavement rather than a route a ball

00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:08,720
location so what should we do here again

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,220
I'm sure we've all seen this thing where

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,539
it's two loops back because it's kind of

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,320
got to get the end of the road finds a

00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:16,730
connection and then routes along so if

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,630
you shouldn't it should be reachable it

00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,520
shouldn't be like this should we have a

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,580
lots of random an infinite number of

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,870
crossing points well maybe although

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,460
actually pedestrians are actually the

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:30,919
greatest Pythagorean so it's probably

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:32,539
more like that and we're we're you know

00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,340
we just ran to the cross but the point

00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:37,370
is we again we sort of tried to

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,539
represent a space which certainly the UK

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:42,440
means you can just cross the road where

00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:46,850
if you want unlike the US and with

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,860
routes for lines so before I come on to

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,480
a couple of suggestions what will solve

00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,100
this there's also the problem of where

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,110
we have multiple methods to represent

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,179
the same thing so this is the cycle

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,100
parking just outside it's actually quite

00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:01,130
a large area so I would perceive done

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,799
that's an area but that is actually

00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,330
represented as a point and which means

00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,940
that the users of it

00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,379
of our data you've got to have two

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,179
different ways of processing this stuff

00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:13,340
but ultimately you know even a single

00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:15,200
parking cycle parking space is an area

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,649
it takes up you know one meter square

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,330
roughly another problem which is

00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:22,249
emerging and particularly with the

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:25,009
waiting's like a scooters and and stuff

00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:29,409
is the curbside problem so how do we

00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:32,960
model that there are for example and

00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:35,299
restrictions on the time you can do

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,369
deliveries so for example if you want to

00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,169
deliver to a shop you may only be able

00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:43,369
to do it between 7:00 and 10:00 in the

00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:46,279
morning and this is actually a diagram

00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:48,830
from stated format us I wish I got

00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,419
emailed and what it shows at the top is

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,429
we've got the black line which is so

00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:54,529
this is a top diagram we've got the

00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:57,200
black line which is the street and if

00:19:54,529 --> 00:20:00,169
you look at the fourth water the the red

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,139
line the loading zone that says that

00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:06,200
along this street these are the times

00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:08,139
that you can you can deliver these the

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,639
times the green one is when you can park

00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:12,049
so if we want to represent all these

00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:13,999
restrictions of which there may be

00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:16,850
multiple more there might be as no bin

00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:19,489
times I don't know who knows and we've

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:22,249
got to do the second diagram wishes to

00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:24,499
divide the line up into lots of bits and

00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:26,320
then save between this fourth bit and

00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:28,220
this seventh bit does this restriction

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,200
but the problem of that is that it's

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,679
very brittle because as we've seen the

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,720
third diagram if someone moves the line

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,749
along we've now lost potentially five

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,039
meters of loading zone or whatever so we

00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:41,509
don't really have a good way to model

00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,129
this except to make it extremely

00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:46,730
complicated and difficult for anyone to

00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:48,919
maintain so with all these sorts of

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:51,769
problems where we kind of representing

00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:55,190
spaces as lines I think we need the

00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:56,929
content of a street and I say this is

00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,940
not a sort of fully worked-out concept

00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:01,549
but I want to start a discussion and

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,980
what we've got here is this was the the

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:06,169
one we had the the pedestrian routing

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,600
thing and what I've done is to surround

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:11,690
the street in the two streets with with

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,500
a box so there's this street going here

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,090
which actually is was

00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,770
Somerset close but it also has another

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,840
spur which is actually part of the same

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,670
street it's just we can't represent it

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,930
as a line that Spurs off because we

00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,720
don't have that concept to notice then

00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,370
we don't have multi pilot the lines so

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,120
I've sort of surrounded it essentially

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:32,250
by a red box and what that mean and it

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,140
if you like it it's essentially like a

00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,000
relation it means we could say that

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,250
everything in this box relates to this

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,230
street and so then a walk route so it

00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:42,090
could for example say well I've entered

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,950
I've entered this walking area I

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,410
actually know that even though these

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,150
lines are not necessarily can connected

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,940
at every point I can actually jump

00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,980
across the road and likewise this one

00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,510
sort of for this bit here and you can

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,950
see here we can also then start to do

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,170
things like we can say well this this

00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,540
loading area is within the scope of this

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,570
street we could also say for research

00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:05,100
purposes how wide is this street could

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,720
we for example upgrade the street to

00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,250
have cycleways which is something we

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,690
can't really do at the moment and in

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,490
fact projects I've been doing with Leeds

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,080
University we've actually had to use the

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,970
Ordnance Survey data because they

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,600
actually have real Street polygons which

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:21,360
we don't have so I stopped and it says

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,050
so we already actually have a similar

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,450
sort of concept to this which is

00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:30,450
pedestrian areas we often map pedestrian

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,550
areas which is an area but we also have

00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,250
the lines going through it and although

00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:37,230
this duplication there there are reasons

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,790
for both in that we need the areas so

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:42,570
where it is but we also have a so common

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:44,400
de facto routes that people take and so

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,070
one ways us like to sort of surround

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,560
this there and with overlapping an over

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,900
thing Junction and another possibility

00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,360
might be to tessellate them so that we

00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,700
use the traditional GIS approach which

00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,100
is to say that and the whole world

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,390
consists of polygons that never overlap

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,040
except obviously when you've got

00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,720
different layers but you know you can

00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,180
imagine that you know hit here there's

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,910
Irving and you know these con table app

00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,110
so and again we could have this this

00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,610
idea that you know everything within

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,560
this is this streets everything within

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,900
that Street and it's just an additional

00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,440
data server field the additional data

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:23,070
representation that we could put on top

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:25,740
and similarly what about the concept of

00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,419
a junction so we've got so the idea of

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,609
us in a relation

00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:29,899
Street what about a junction so if you

00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,129
remember this was the one where I said

00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:33,369
you know we don't we've got this weird

00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:36,470
right turn and we don't know how many

00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:39,950
things say now what I've done here is to

00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,690
surround all this bits of stuff which we

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,279
do still need we do still need to know

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,169
that you know the connectivity is

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,210
correct but what I've done is to

00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:49,220
surround all of them the bits of the

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,989
anything that's relating to the concept

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,789
of the junctions where lots of crossing

00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:54,950
where that's the actual point the

00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:56,389
intersection where it's a pedestrian bit

00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,600
whether that's the the lights and so on

00:23:56,389 --> 00:24:01,279
it's all in a junction concept and so

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,320
what we can now so we could now say is

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,629
well if I'm cycling from the bottom here

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,570
to the right

00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:10,970
overall well I can see that connectivity

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:13,759
wise it's correct but my instructions to

00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:16,070
the user can be turned right and that's

00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,070
rather than turn right for two meters

00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:21,619
turn bare right for five meters turn

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,970
left etc we could get much more sensible

00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:25,100
thing and we could also Bend say well

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,480
we've got one Junction we've got lots of

00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,889
lights within it but we know this is a

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,710
junction and therefore we've got one

00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:33,769
delay and we could sort of connect these

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,919
things together somehow thank you very

00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,919
much

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:46,990
so Martin said he once he likes lots of

00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,060
questions so you can throw any so

00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,320
question at him I think I'm interested

00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,570
also if there's anyone from the

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,370
baden-württemberg Minister transport

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:59,280
they might be interesting people to talk

00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:59,280
to but we've got a question up there

00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,110
interesting group it actually reminds me

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:10,540
of one recent project but we're working

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:13,180
right now about indoor routing so

00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:16,750
basically 80% of the problems are the

00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,490
same the linear model of streets what

00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:22,140
we're using this is really good for

00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:24,040
linearly moving objects like cars but

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,500
pedestrians especially what also

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,600
bicyclists are not clean hours so we

00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,360
will need to have a combination of

00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,360
linear model and the kind of space open

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,040
space based model so your mapping

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,860
basically positive and negative space

00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:41,920
and some relations inside sir instead of

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,780
trying to put everything two lines so in

00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,670
our project we ended up building our own

00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:49,000
routing engine because we didn't find

00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:51,940
anyone and really having sister Oakland

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,340
space routing of course indoors as its

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,770
own specifics and outdoors has own also

00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:00,160
but I think the concept of combination

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:02,410
of linear and space may based model is

00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,630
kind of solution here of course it is

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:07,120
very difficult to map positive or

00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:13,300
negative space of city environment but

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:18,160
probably we will end up beset so just we

00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:20,580
have a balance right yeah did you

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,580
accomplish

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,030
that's in subject okay so he's thinking

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,260
about the same things anyone would

00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,600
differently she never there

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,490
let's go for the lady at the back and

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,120
then we'll go to the gentleman further

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,610
forward

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:38,530
if you yet can you see if you run down

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:41,090
my teeth waiting to say will forget you

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:47,060
it's a long way to run you could get

00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:49,430
anything thank you for your talk very

00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,580
interesting we ran into the same

00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:56,360
problems doing interpreting in our main

00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:59,390
stations and we proposed some solutions

00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,540
on the wiki page which is called

00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:06,170
guidelines for pedestrian navigation so

00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:09,290
I invite you to read it and if you have

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:12,110
any advice or remarks we are really

00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:15,560
interested to share with anyone on this

00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:19,010
subject but we also use a sophistic I

00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:21,650
really in side and nearby the stations

00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:24,770
for example in front of the stations

00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:36,590
where there are very complex pedestrian

00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:37,550
areas so thanks justjust well gets into

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,810
this question I just want to give

00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,700
another example this is the wrong with

00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:42,920
lanes for Sat Navs you know that Lane

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,720
sometimes come and go you're so problem

00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,000
have the lane where a lane is taken up

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,860
by parking you know that's a spatial

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,090
concept is that really two lanes or one

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,920
when we've you know there's lots of

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,460
areas where we always compromised sorry

00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,460
thank you

00:27:54,580 --> 00:28:02,330
your example with the difficult Street

00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:07,190
in Cambridge or in England how's it

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:11,060
solved by um mapping to inside the area

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:13,070
do you met all the flaws then so the

00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:17,990
solution for this that has been adopted

00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:19,370
in Cambridge is is indeed that so we you

00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,980
know I would like to think we do be very

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,420
good routing for it but I would argue

00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,250
cartographically it's not ideal and we

00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,480
have the problem of you know the the

00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,980
geometry is being wrong at the

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,470
Junction's further up because they've

00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,930
got to combine and then split again the

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:36,350
this sort of problems

00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:38,390
okay they say we've got Ilya speaking

00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:41,180
now if he comes up and picks up his life

00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:44,690
one thing what Anu you thought maybe not

00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:47,150
about talking can we do anything with

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:50,060
the local authorities like that one of

00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:51,650
the us loading times I might Shirley

00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,510
you're gonna get confused yourself maybe

00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,370
someone in the office might update it

00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:58,340
wrong and can they just make it simpler

00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:00,920
for us well my view is that actually if

00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,300
we want an example good good provision

00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,800
for cycling we need to make sure that it

00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,760
is separate from traffic so I actually

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,880
think the poem is going to get much

00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:11,530
worse than better so there's a

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,530
possibility but thank you very much

00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,260
