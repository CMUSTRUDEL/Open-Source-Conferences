the last week the rest okay so

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,310
everything starts with map and geography

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,540
and pry or introducing the talk and

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,740

platform OSM okay so OpenStreetMap to go

00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:18,359
to grow in the capital but also in the

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:22,200
region focus first its effort towards a

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:25,890
young audience mad of students but also

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,950
yes were active in the technology

00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:34,360
they're also looking at engaging with

00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:39,240
public institutions and the private

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:42,580
sectors but actors that will need

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,140
OpenStreetMap basically to fulfill the

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,520
mandate and carry out their activities

00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:53,290
in terms of component of activities for

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:58,720
these given audiences they're running

00:04:53,290 --> 00:05:00,940
training on a regular basis from basic

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,270
OpenStreetMap creations and notions to

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:07,600
things more advanced in terms of using

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:14,290
the OpenStreetMap data via GIS or web

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:17,470
gia stuffs they used the format of the

00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:20,080
capacity-building missions that brought

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,360
OpenStreetMap teacher go in the form of

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,810
what they call the capital camp which

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,590
allow them for a couple of days to go

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:34,240
and do OpenStreetMap in cities outside

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:38,919
of of the capital domain they can also

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:42,730
do that internally in LeMay they're also

00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:45,100
running one day activities like cattle

00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,230
party which involved field work and

00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,650
field surveys or they're running

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,450
mapperton where they contribute Lee they

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,030
are remotely contributing to

00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,640
OpenStreetMap in the country or in

00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,210

GPS is from the First Nations you've got

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:30,099
a GSM screenshot showing the result of a

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:32,219
survey that happens through one of those

00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:38,800
mapping parties that's been thrown out

00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:43,800
you can also see the result of area a

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:47,949
remote mapping sessions with some tea

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:51,880
tea and coffee are important elements

00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:55,300
for any mapping in Togo and the last

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:59,340
pictures show the interest of

00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:06,389
OpenStreetMap to go into yolks and

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:06,389
onions from from schools or universities

00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:15,979
those are simple appreciated uniformity

00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:18,679

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:35,449
doing they are not they're not

00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:39,860
forgetting to adventure lies and be

00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:43,759
present at its outreach events and

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:48,680
you've got a series of of visualization

00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:53,000
and an info graphics that show their

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:55,310
activity in that in that field they're

00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,790
taking outreach and communication very

00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:05,509
seriously as you can see ya up the tooth

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:07,670
nose activity no bueno can't look at

suck compared to a community where same

00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:33,050
girls so side of the various generic

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,649
training activities you know SM to go

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:44,990
they decided to set forth training

00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:47,389
towards young young women and that's

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,430
something which is happening more and

00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:54,860
more on a regular basis they try to

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:57,490
articulate their work with the

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:01,819
collective OpenStreetMap girls which

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:05,779
formed itself in 2015 in la May at the

00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:08,529
event of an OE f founded capacity

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:58,490
cut well some of your acumen are

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,490
appended or new

00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:30,740
so while ma is looking for an AO so that

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:36,820
you can see the result of of a cattle

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:41,570
camp or a mapping tour outside of of the

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:44,900
of the capital she previously show a

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:47,510
list of localities where cattle camps of

00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,990
a couple of days have been held I'm not

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:54,260
going to spell wrongly the lovely names

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:57,890
that ma spelled out and I'm giving back

00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,640
the mic it doesn't come with a

00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,040
difference

00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,640
I wonder LS returned I have a padded own

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:10,480

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,480
a formal a suit I knew her a please do

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,830
please do contribution on a passer ma a

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,660
Tipu collectively Dona Mirana

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:24,500
formalization dilemma hey des when she

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,760
is young public sigil I'm Mary Pookie

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,950
Haqqanis Laval

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,930
they don't know open system up don't let

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:35,660
combo so well when elements you have to

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,220
bear in mind thinking about the Carter

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,520
camp held by the folks from

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:43,460
OpenStreetMap Togo is that it's not a

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,940
data track where you're creating the

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,310
item

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,590
it's a wool capacity building with

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:53,450
previous outreach to people that are

00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:56,750
going to remain on site and that will be

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:59,030
towed out to map and will probably work

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:02,870
with folks from OpenStreetMap to go and

00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,670
do the best to use their resources so

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,000
that they can maintain the data or

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:12,170
expanded so there is really an attempt

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,750

spans both OpenStreetMap creations but

00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:40,060
also we use of OpenStreetMap data in GIS

web GIS or spatial data infrastructure

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,870
they are tied this training is

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,350
systematically tied with data creations

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:52,880
the data creations during those training

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:57,020
can meet needs the long-term needs of

00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:03,529
the local community or a partner of the

00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:08,090

2017 and 2018 those training are not

00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:40,490
only related and not only focused on

00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:43,309
acquiring OpenStreetMap or genius skills

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:47,600
but also skills that can be passed by

00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:50,480
people from the collective of active in

the future the USM Togo's community

00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:18,020
wants to focus its efforts in terms of

improving the toggle is road network

00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:24,410
which is already quite good

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:29,990
they will dedicate significant resources

00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:33,140
to building more walnuts around

00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:37,280
OpenStreetMap it's to the mapping

00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:41,150
activities and there was also

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:45,080
to be more active mentoring individuals

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,150
also contributing data into

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:55,730
groups just just wants to act so that

00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:59,560
there will be more data and more Calot

willingness with the existing resources

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:12,170
that they can mobilize to help putting

00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:17,920
resources for mapping into the ends of
