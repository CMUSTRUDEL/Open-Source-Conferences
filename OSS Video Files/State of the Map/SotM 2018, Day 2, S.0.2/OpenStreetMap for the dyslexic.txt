The 8% of the population has huge problems reading and browsing maps because is dyslexic. Moreover OpenStreetMap is so rich of geographical data to be crowded for such people. During the session we will present the application we developed, the multisensorial approach we used and the feedback we had after two years of activities.

okay good afternoon to everybody

00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:13,779
my focus is GIS for dyslexic my name is

00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:16,840
Massimiliano Burnaby and I will present

00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:21,339
you the experience of OpenStreetMap for

00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:24,550
the dyslexic there are eight percent of

00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:25,630
people in the world is dyslexic they

00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,900
have problems

00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:34,180
acquiring reading and estimating space

00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:37,750
in pages in interfaces and in maps okay

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:41,860
our group works every day with dyslexic

00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:45,460
we have applied and evolved the

00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:48,400
multi-sensory approach which which we

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,210
knows working well for the alphanumeric

00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:57,160
word in the general case we applied it

00:00:52,210 --> 00:01:00,760
to the maps okay we actually have

00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,400
realized the first map a dyslexic can

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,400
easily read and we built unaware a

00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,420
mobile application on the top of it our

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:14,469
map talks to the user the content and

00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,899
the moreover has a specific

00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:20,979
functionalities that help the user to

00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:23,200
get the content one functionality is the

00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:26,859
location history which keeps track of

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,020
the path the user followed to reach the

00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:31,689
current location we have a customized

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:36,100
version of the map overlay overview and

00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:39,549
many others our map shows less data than

00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:44,889
the others if you compare our maps with

00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:47,829
open state map you recognize that 10% of

00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:54,490
the information is given by us and the

00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:57,549
rest is OK and to balance this lack of

00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,950
information we we made the

00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:02,429
identification process very very fast

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:09,220
because we want the user to identify

00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:12,479
objects okay I have a little demo of the

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,479
process of identification

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:23,270
okay this is an identification made the

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,090
cross layer in real time the directly

00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,850
client-side okay

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:33,230
this is not the the page that the user

00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:36,200
views but is attached demo okay so for

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:40,060
this point under the mouse over you see

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:44,920
a real time of watch is under the mouse

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:48,860
okay and everything is done client-side

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:54,800
okay so back to my presentation which is

00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:57,950
more more or less finished okay okay

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,460
this is our story we have two years of

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:04,940
user experience collected with this

00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,710
feedback we are now building the second

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,010
version of the base map and the new

00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:17,210
version for the mobile application thank

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:22,030
you so if we have some questions for

00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:22,030
this speaker while we switch to the next

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:34,850
were there any questions so to can-can

00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:41,209
I'm not that familiar with adaptation of

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:44,330
text for thank you I'm not very familiar

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:47,480
with specific changes required for the

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:52,459
psychic community in terms of improving

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:56,330
the content Oh is styling enough to make

00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:59,060
the change - to solve most of the issues

00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:03,520
or fundamental data changes are required

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:08,090
for for the community

00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:10,220
we made the changes in labeling which is

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:16,900
very very important and we surround

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:20,900
every label white space - to get our

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:25,710
visibility visibility we select fonts

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:33,800
and we write every label let's try now

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:33,800
no VR via roma written down one okay

00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:40,349
plus we added specific function plus we

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,259
added specific functionality with which

00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:46,949
helped the user to recognize the content

00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:49,610
of the map so both are required that for

00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:52,610
our point of view styling and

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,610
