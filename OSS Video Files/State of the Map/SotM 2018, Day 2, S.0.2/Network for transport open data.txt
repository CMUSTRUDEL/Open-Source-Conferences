As part of an open governance and data-driven cities model, we present an inter-institutional strategy with local communities, for the participatory generation of standardized data on public transport in different cities of the world that can be compiled in an open global platform and facilitate urban research, regulation and planning, between countries and continents. The data in open format seeks to be operable in Openstreetmap as well as in any platform at the same time for citizen consultation, improving the accessibility experience, and modeling with the aim of more efficient and equitable urban planning. The general intention is to share data in the same standard format (GTFS), data collection methodologies, experiences, training in the complete survey cycle to insert the data in the urban planning process. In this initiative, Openstreetmap is both a data receiver and analysis support (routing, comprehensive accessibility analysis)

and hello everybody can you hear me well

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:14,650
okay firstly I want to thank organizer

00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:19,150
for the scholarship I had to to be able

00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:21,429
to attend and I talked also on transport

00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,929
data and the initiative we have in the

00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:28,659
world Resource Institute to promote open

00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:32,200
standards and open data and for

00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:35,200
transportation systems and strategy we

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,190
have to create a resources Center for

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,400
these data and experience and

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,920
methodologies so in the walrus's

00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,190
Institute we work on sustainable

00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,840
development city and urban planning is

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,770
one of the main areas of the

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,400
organization

00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:57,579
I'm from Mexico fees and so then we work

00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,670
on Latin America and a lot of issues but

00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:05,369
specifically on transport public

00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:09,159
transportation so on one hand we have

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,829
growing penetration of smartphones in in

00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,539
the whole world and also in the

00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:18,850
developing world in the developing

00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:22,119
cities this the situation impacts in a

00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:24,039
lot of data big data creation we have a

00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:29,109
lot of potential with we are not using

00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:32,740
for now totally and in the other ends

00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:35,259
there is a growing needs of information

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:41,049
for transport travelers and for planners

00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:43,270
in into developing world local

00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,340
governments has a very low technical

00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:49,209
capacity very low capacity to create

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:53,109
data and with the data the planning

00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:58,539
capacity is low too with a very bad

00:01:53,109 --> 00:02:02,590
impact in transport conditions and into

00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:06,579
the development of cities so what

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:13,060
firstly what do we mean by transport

00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:16,140
data and to have a useful data system we

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,319
need maps digital maps of route

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,410
starts in the same way we have the

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,690
presentation before we need his variable

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,480
speeds depending on the moments of the

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,330
days and depending on the days of the

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,760
week and the weeks of the year we need

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,209
timetables for scheduled services and

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,820
frequency of the services and ideally

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:41,190
real-time location of the units of

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:45,810
transport vehicles and real-time traffic

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:51,150
and congestion updates and what is

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:55,470
transport open data ideally - they are

00:02:51,150 --> 00:03:04,110
public feeds and is easily accessible

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:06,269
feeds using standard format - to another

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,080
governments and private application to

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:14,209
access very easily and to allow private

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,840
stew AI innovate with new technologies

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:20,760
so I present some tools generally open

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,370
code to create so they try and to use

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,519
these days this data transit wand is now

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:30,060
it's a mobile life up with a based app

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:33,209
for visualization and this allows to

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:37,170
create the data in the bus so you track

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:40,980
the root and the stops geo-referenced in

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:43,920
the transport it has it has the related

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,799
to a lot of new mobile apps now in

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,700
Mexico we have a Spanish version named

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,640
map map developed like Cody and om1 seed

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,760
mix now remix is a base that is a

00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,579
web-based application where you can draw

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,860
the system as a city of the Cairo use

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:06,989
the application to map the whole system

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:10,170
and it's based on Open Street Map - and

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:13,260
you have a lot of open code technology

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:17,190
to convert Open Street Map format or

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:20,880
shapefile format to GTFS so in mexico

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:26,010
city we adapted GTFS editor - for

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:28,530
governments tool and finally the use of

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,960
standards and that a good point for the

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:34,669
GTFS

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:37,550
help helps the development sector to

00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:40,039
innovate to be able to create a lot of

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,220
technology and a lot of products like

00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:45,289
printed maps because they can benefit

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:51,370
from the same conditions and clear

00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:55,520
conditions to to develop and they are

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:58,370
several repositories of data and transit

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:03,470
land is now closed but it was one of the

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:08,690
main repositories with GTFS exchange it

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:11,960
had 300 cities transport system transit

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:15,080
fields is another and in general with

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,570
these repositories you can see a gap

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,320
between northward and southward

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:23,510
so in double varieties MIT the World

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,770
Bank and other institutions we are

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:31,490
working to promote participatory mapping

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:36,260
in the south world where we have a big

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:38,900
technical difficulty is that is in this

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:42,410
cities we have informal transport

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:47,300
systems so it's not so easy as a formal

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:51,199
transport system but we are trying to to

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,510
create a platform to share experiences

00:05:51,199 --> 00:06:00,139
methodologies open codes technologies

00:05:53,510 --> 00:06:03,080
and data to another very important point

00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:06,080
and we are not talking a lot so that in

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,389
this event is that one of the uses for

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,849
the travellers and other uses for

00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:17,449
planners so the GTFS format and it's

00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:21,710
easy structures I was allowed to create

00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:26,030
tools for planners and why is why is it

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:29,050
important again the very low technical

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:36,169
capacity in developing countries and

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:39,980
make the local governments unable to to

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:43,070
work for easily with GIS software so

00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:46,280
this tool accessibility tool or open

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:51,710
trip planner made by conveyer an

00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:55,580
American startup and wri and the World

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:58,340
Bank is like a simplified GIS and it

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:03,050
helps to make some network analysis very

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:06,920
easily to understand to observe the

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:10,340
accessibility in a city through the road

00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:17,540
system and through transport system with

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:20,900
GTFS format so ok it used these data you

00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,940
can upload shape files of population and

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:28,600
opportunities with your opportunities we

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:32,060
mean employment equipment like health

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:35,930
equipments or educational equipment and

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,120
we can test the performance of the

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,570
transport system to access to this

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:45,140
equipment for the whole population of

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:48,160
specific areas in the city so it's very

00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:51,770
important to help you plan both

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:59,150
transport transport system and housing

00:07:51,770 --> 00:08:02,330
or equipment location we also with this

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:04,820
type of analysis we also can make

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:08,330
indicators performance indicators in the

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:12,710
city benchmarking and evaluate

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:16,820
sustainable development goals I'll show

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:20,450
very quickly some maps so in this one

00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:22,730
it's Buenos Aires it's a comparison to

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:26,990
accessibility we through public

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:30,710
transportation and automobile this map

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:36,110
of Mexico City overlap in red in red

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:39,380
color population density and isochrones

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,810
of main accessibility by public

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:46,940
transport so we can see that large areas

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:49,580
are not covered by the system and this

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,890
this indicator helps you understand

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,769
what's a part of the population who

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,220
access to

00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:58,379
employment or which parts of the labor

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:05,069
market is accessible for the population

00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:07,529
of the cities Buenos Aires - and in this

00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:11,519
case we helped the government of Puebla

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:14,910
in Mexico to plan to test as a location

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,999
of a new routes of transport looking at

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:21,480
the impacts in your accessibility that's

00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:24,149
these routes alone or not alone we can

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,959
see there it's so impact is not so good

00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:31,559
so they can move the line on on the tool

00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:35,309
and these studies are from other

00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:38,040
institutions and where they can make a

00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:39,920
benchmark of the accessibility of cities

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,309
through the public transportation

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,769
oh this way it's a ranking of United

00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:49,439
States cities according to their

00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:56,279
disability to job by public transport

00:09:49,439 --> 00:10:00,179
again so so we pretend to farm to build

00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:03,839
a platform what would be a resources

00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:07,769
center where we try to centralize data

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,970
so it can be a repository but mainly we

00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:13,649
want to share to make networks between

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,480
organization who have met who have

00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,819
worked with communities to map search on

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,209
to the system transport in the South

00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:23,939
certain cities and we also want to share

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:26,149
methodologies openko technologies to do

00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:26,149
that

00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:41,009
etc so we specifically interest on

00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:43,470
informal systems and yeah so the

00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:46,110
philosophy of this platform would be

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:49,110
south-south cooperation open governments

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,819
and social innovation and making a link

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,269
with local government to help them to

00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:57,959
use and take advantage of this type of

00:10:54,269 --> 00:11:04,210
data and makes a link with technological

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:07,429
sector - that's it thank you

00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,429
[Applause]

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:15,709
and we invite people who have

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:19,459
participated so this type of operation

00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,300
to connect with us thank you for the

00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:26,329
presentation

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:28,160
questions thanks very much for your

00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:34,100
presentation Selena and for the research

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,720
that wdr did WRI in regards to the

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,970
accessibility of cities do you have

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,920
recommendations of what people could map

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,820
to be able to identify that an Open

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,560
Street Map what they come up yes so

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,180
given the data that you found around

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,820
accessibility do you have any

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,160
suggestions around what we what should

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,740
be focused on in terms of mapping to be

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,550
able to kind of improve the data set

00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:02,829
yeah so point is a little complex

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:05,269
because the technologies to help

00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:09,829
travelers to have a good information of

00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:12,649
the whole system to be able to move in a

00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:15,230
performance way needs to have the

00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:18,829
complete system in the same moment so

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:21,079
it's a better way is to organize massive

00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:25,070
ma patterns in certain moments of the

00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:27,380
year and ideally it would be each year

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:30,050
to have the date of the whole system

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,890
because in formal system are moving very

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:35,510
fast lines are disappearing lines are

00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,199
appearing all the time

00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:42,470
so map at CERN is the best way I think

00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:44,690
maybe maybe a good way the question of

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,970
the updates of the system is it's a

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:51,319
large debates but may be a good ways to

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:57,079
have first massive mapperton and updates

00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:59,810
it's by case-by-case users editing from

00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:03,610
one line that has disappeared or one

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:06,889
night that has changed the route and

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:09,160
using the apps developed specifically

00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:11,350
for creating zones ETFs are

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:17,570
OpenStreetMap formats

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:21,560
transport system so the app is made to

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:24,200
track the root and the stops mainly over

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:28,360
type of data is allowed by this type of

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:31,100
application that are how many people is

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,830
taking the bus and is leaving the bus

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:39,380
for example and taking photos of the

00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:42,380
birth to have the destination and they

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,960
can ask it's it's it's important for the

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,420
GTFS format they can ask to the driver

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,180
the frequency of the service and our

00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:56,810
words of the start and the end of the

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:59,330
service in the day morning and night you

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,600
mentioned the open repository for GFS

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:05,210
kids transit kids and as far as I know

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,720
there are four active site request

00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:11,690
stories including transit lens which is

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,840
facilitated by maps and some others so

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:18,230
why in your play story and did you think

00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:22,310
about combining before stories and I can

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:26,390
see very well yeah so yeah so there are

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:28,730
many open at least for active open DC of

00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,970
Brazil histories including transit land

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:38,660
by maksim by late web them

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:40,910
so did you think that maybe joining the

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,760
forces with other posters might help

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:47,450
your course and however any plans for

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,870
that yeah yeah totally so it is not to

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:55,540
optimize the repository but giving more

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:59,090
visibility because non non specialists

00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:02,360
don't know GTFS formats just and that at

00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:05,830
this point so repository can be mirrors

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,830
or something yeah

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:20,320
I okay it's not a question but more

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,200
precision because we discuss already

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,320
together about this creating a GTFS

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,020
first and I'm trying to recreate the

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,730
data in OpenStreetMap after all creating

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,600
the data directly in OpenStreetMap and

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:37,300
then generate the GTFS feed so i'm from

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,280
jungle bus and we we are we strongly

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,860
believe that creating to that I know SM

00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,790
Trust is the best option but I just

00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:48,730
wanted to publicly like discuss about

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:52,690
that is these two options that could be

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:57,490
good or bad depending the the context

00:15:52,690 --> 00:16:02,140
the the places where we map so we are

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:04,810
developing this osm to GTFS tool and if

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:09,240
guys you want to join to help us to

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,240
develop that you're very welcome

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:17,710
yeah I think it's a good debate to have

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,850
and I invite people who are interested

00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:23,650
in this topic here so maybe have

00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:27,430
continues the debates with jungle you

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:33,430
have a study on that so we could

00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:35,770
continue online maybe - I just want to

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:38,020
say to everybody that tomorrow at 10:15

00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,420
we will have above about those and other

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:43,560
topics so please come

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,560
thank you

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:57,780
hello so have you thought about other

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:59,700
formats than GPFS because have you

00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:03,840
thought about link data for example to

00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:08,520
publish the transit schedules link data

00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:12,030
link data no no yes it would be like

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,920
GTFS is a one date of dump for transit

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,060
agency or whatever there are better ways

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:24,890
nowadays to publish this kind of data

00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:24,890
just yeah you haven't I look at it I

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:33,020
think at least in Latin America in

00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:38,180
Mexico

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:42,180
really I insists technical level in

00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:45,410
local government is so low that it's

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:49,200
important to have a non confusing

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:53,480
discuss toward them so we try to talk

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:57,450
about one format in particular the

00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:01,260
easiest to use clearer to clearest to

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,690
understand so we we work with the GTFS

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:09,960
formats but it's it doesn't mean it's a

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:13,550
only formats no the best okay thank you

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,550
for the presentation and the questions

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,099
