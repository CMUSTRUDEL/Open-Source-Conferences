Helsinki Regional Transport Authority HSL has renewed its map production and OSM has been the base for all new printed and digital maps since early 2015. Some of the products are bilingual, and some are used nationwide in collaboration with national authorities and other cities. Walking and cycling paths are in focus, and public transport stops link OSM to the schedules.

We show what we've done so far regarding community building, map data editing, imports, map styling, traditional route maps, bus stop poster maps, journey planner and Android/iPhone app. Plans for the future include more map products and more OSM validation processes. We share our experiences introducing OSM as the authority's official map.

Tools we use and have contributed to include Mapbox GL, OpenMapTiles, OpenTripPlanner, Pelias, TileLive and TileReduce. Software we develop as open source in the HSLdevcom Github account include hsl-map-style, digitransit-ui and hsl-map-generator. We provide open data and open APIs at hsl.fi/en/opendata including vector tiles, static schedules and real time vehicle locations.

okay Buon Giorno could be hello

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,429
everybody so my name is Marco Jota and I

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,309
work as a GIS specialist in Helsinki

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,990
public transport and I'm going to give

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,740
you a broad presentation of what we've

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,410
done with OpenStreetMap lately so let's

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,440
get started right away first a few

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:30,990
slides about what our organization does

00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:33,510
is it prepares the hands in the region

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,480
transport system plan that includes more

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,219
more than just public transport that we

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,989
do in collaboration with our

00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:46,170
municipality member municipalities and

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,210
then we also plan the and organize the

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,920
public transport of course in the region

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:55,109
and then we procure the bus tram Metro

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,890
ferry and commuter change services and

00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:02,309
then we also have the public transport

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,970
fare and ticketing system on our agenda

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,710
and then of course marketing passenger

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,939
information and return of stuff and

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:14,640
ticket sales and ticket inspections and

00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:17,189
our organization includes nine

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,950
municipalities that's the blue ones on

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:25,770
the map and then the others the white

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:28,380
are they are possible they have

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,609
possibility to join us and that's the

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,820
area for which we do this traffic system

00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:39,810
planning that includes all other modes

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:43,259
of transport as well well a few years

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:47,909
back we started to think about a map

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,979
production renewal that aims to and

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,450
consistent visual look and feel for all

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:59,149
on that both digital and printed and

00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:01,469
also we try to keep in mind that our

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,929
processes would be systematic and

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:08,550
effective we really do use manual work

00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:11,879
and try to increase the ability to react

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,470
on the past on changes and one key

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,710
element was

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:21,510
to start use osm and as the main data

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:25,560
source for all our maps and we also try

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:27,870
to keep in the mind that we develop

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:36,620
products that's based on customer needs

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:36,620
we have done some some tests with with

00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:43,350
the users to see that we are on the

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:47,430
right track on that one and then we also

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,860
have a besides this map production

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,930
renewal we're renewing our public

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:58,830
transport register that's the base for

00:02:51,930 --> 00:03:02,010
all our GIS data the trade routes the

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,670
ten timetables and bus stops and that

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,670
kind of stuff

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:13,680
a few years back the map products we

00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:17,070
have looks a bit like this we had lots

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,560
of difference in different types of map

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,690
open closed

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,320
Google Open Street Map some in some

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:28,830
cases as well and this is what we aim

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:32,250
for like we have on one custom map style

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:36,360
that includes several juming layer

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,480
layers and the sole source data would be

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,790
available as vector layers and what

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,180
we've done we produce the map style of

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:49,350
our own with matte box based on OS and

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:55,650
bright template and Finnish Finland bean

00:03:49,350 --> 00:04:00,510
and multi Lang multi language country we

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:04,350
offer this map service in Finnish

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:07,310
Swedish that's the two main languages in

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:10,290
Finland and then we also have a joint

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:14,100
where we show both Finnish and Swedish

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,950
names this is because we need that on

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:20,669
printed map so our journey planner can

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:23,350
switch when you to change language so we

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:25,870
can change the from the Finnish

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,830
Maps file to the Swedish Maps and so on

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:34,110
but we can't do that on printed maps and

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:39,340
this map map style is available as API

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:42,070
both as a raster background as tile map

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,370
service and map map box

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:48,190
vector tiles for so called HSL layers

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,080
that stops terminals mending points and

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,980
parking right sites and city bike

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,700
stations and pair zones as we're anu and

00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:01,390
them in a few years though or late this

00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,750
year so those are coming as well later

00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:07,480
on yeah some of you might be familiar

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:10,840
with our journey planner if you go to

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:15,010
race the opposite fi you can test it out

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,440
it's available in English but a little

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:23,110
more about this protocol project it's a

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:26,020
joint project with the matka dot AFI

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:30,040
it's the national journey planner for

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:39,580
finland and then there's this Baldy also

00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:42,010
that is the national ticket system in

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,710
finland and because of this cobbler

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:48,580
aberration this journey planner is also

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:51,820
used in about ten other Finnish cities

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,430
and what we've done the project name is

00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,980
DT transit you can find more information

00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,950
about that on BD transit okay bye and

00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:08,020
the source codes are available on our

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:11,110
github repositories but to take a brief

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:17,290
introduction it's based on open trip

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:20,170
planner API it's and it will use the

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,560
open trip planner API and the routing mg

00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:26,740
and top on top of this we have made in

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:31,570
principle just the user interface and

00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:34,150
that's what I would call that the digi

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,279
transit is about but data that comes

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:40,929
into DT 20 the

00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:46,569
real-time data in Siri formats and then

00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:50,169
we have osm that's the key component for

00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:54,339
the geocoding and row team but then also

00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:57,039
of course the GTFS style that what

00:06:54,339 --> 00:07:00,819
mentioned he'll here earlier on it's a

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:05,289
format for the routes and timetables and

00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:08,229
so on but as we're going national with

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:11,759
this version on the national journey

00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:13,749
planner the OS ma OS m is not so

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,259
comprehensive in northern parts of in

00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:18,869
London

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:21,939
so we need to backup it with some other

00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:25,389
administrative open data addresses from

00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:27,819
the population register Center and names

00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:33,509
name data from the National Land Survey

00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:36,909
and some administer areas and well what

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:39,219
comes out from the api's we have map

00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:42,099
tiles you have geocoding services

00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:44,949
routing services and real-time data

00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:47,289
services but you if you're not familiar

00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:51,519
with the journey plan you should check

00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:54,360
it out great feel pass notified besides

00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:57,309
that we've also created a map generator

00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:04,029
it's a web-based tool for generating

00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:07,059
Maps the output formats is PNG and if

00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:10,239
you want you can get out the PNG world

00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:19,959
file as well so you can continue working

00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:23,199
with with the files in the in QGIS or

00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:25,899
something some other GIS tools source

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,849
code is also in github and we have some

00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:30,789
different Troost cases for instance

00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:33,399
route maps traffic bulletins and we're

00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:36,939
building on with new products all the

00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:40,019
time and those as I did those are also

00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:43,180
available source code on github and

00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:45,540
here's what the interface looks like for

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:49,870
this webpage

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:54,939
map generator you can they're on the

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:57,839
left side use have some of the layers

00:08:54,939 --> 00:09:00,670
available there's background map and the

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,569
Swedish names Finnish names and stops

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:07,810
and text and some other things that you

00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:10,750
can choose if you want one thing visible

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:15,209
or not and then on top you have a couple

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:18,730
of parameters for the size and the

00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:22,480
accuracy and the scale and such and then

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:25,810
in general that's the light area is the

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,350
area you get printed as it print it out

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:34,860
and then you just generate it on the

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,860
bottom is generate map you can save some

00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:42,759
if you have done this pointed out a

00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,529
certain area and some certain certain

00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:48,399
layers you can save that as a template

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:50,949
and use later on as well so here is an

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,970
example that we produced with our map

00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:59,740
generator it's a road maps that we use

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:02,620
on we have this handheld maps that we

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:07,059
give up to customers on the upper left

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:13,170
upper right and down on on the right you

00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:17,079
have a this on bigger hubs we show the

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:21,699
show the public transport network in a

00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:25,089
greater way and we work quite a lot with

00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:28,709
the labeling in this case but kept not

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:31,449
out of very good result I think you know

00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:35,500
enough to put it out to customers in a

00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:39,240
way and then one other thing we used the

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:42,459
map generated forests to inform about

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,180
diversions and traffic moving stops and

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:50,589
move move moving lines and that's kind

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:53,829
of stuff another two we also produce

00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:57,130
this top poster generator it's also

00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:58,630
web-based tool and the those source code

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,699
and also found

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,759
we found on github and in the middle

00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:06,610
that you can see the how the interface

00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:11,290
for that one looks up you can choose

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:17,740
from a stop poster a big one we put up

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:20,980
on on a bus stop shelters I go into

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:24,250
detail about the poster on my next bike

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,740
so I don't talk more about that but when

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:31,630
then we also can choose just timetables

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:34,089
and this outpost format is PDF and there

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,370
in the interface you choose from those

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:43,690
two options and then you can choose if

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:48,250
you the next next thing you choose here

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:50,740
is a the listing if you want to list

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:56,290
individual tour tops or then we have

00:11:50,740 --> 00:12:02,920
also group the stops by into smaller

00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:05,889
packages because the people that put

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,649
them on place they are contractors we

00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:12,100
use and they they have certain certain

00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:15,180
packages there's a certain certain stops

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:19,060
that they take care of and then you just

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,089
generate these and if this is fully

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,589
automatic and what you get out is

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:26,649
something like this I have three

00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:32,220
examples of the stop posters here and

00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:35,439
you can see that it's a modular modular

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:39,069
thing that we get out and depending on

00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:44,380
the on the right there's a stop with a

00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:47,709
lot of timetable data so then the map

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:52,660
it's a map that showing the nearby area

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:56,680
for the stops is shrunk into a quite

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:59,130
small map but maybe this other two are

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:05,319
more than normal

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:08,680
normal results and they said on top we

00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:10,540
have a list of the lines that we have on

00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,660
the

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:16,900
that go past the stop and then this

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:21,520
timetable and then we have this nearby

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:23,380
area map where you show the the stops

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,500
that you're actually on on the middle

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:29,950
and then what's around you can see a few

00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,320
of the nearby stops and points of

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:36,880
interest and such and beneath that we

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:39,850
have a schematic presentation of the

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,300
lines that you can take from that stop

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:47,920
and where they go and if there's tariffs

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:51,400
Joan changes or you can change to trains

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,370
and such we try to change Shelby so as

00:13:51,400 --> 00:14:00,850
well and as I said this is a modular

00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:03,490
construction so if if the timetable area

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:06,880
takes a lot of space then you drop out

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,610
the top listing of the lines and the

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,660
next thing to drop out if this not

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:15,370
spaced it's this schematic

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,040
representation and then the map itself

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:22,050
and there are some stops that are full

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:26,830
with the timetable timetable

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:30,460
presentation them and this well you you

00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:33,250
couldn't understand that this posters

00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:36,640
can only be used when we have a space

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,020
for them like like those bus stops where

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,190
where there are shelters and that

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:44,230
something yes about these enough about

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:49,540
these tools about working with the

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:57,300
community this journey planner we had we

00:14:49,540 --> 00:15:00,130
have we have made sort of guidelines or

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,070
destructions for the community to

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,720
understand how the journey planner works

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:12,820
with always some data and we have

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:15,930
learned one web page for that and sooner

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,210
this year we also be coming out with the

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:21,110
explicit permission to import our data

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,930
into osm that's

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:27,230
one thing we've forgotten that for a

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:29,510
time there are few organizations in

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,450
Finland that already had issued this

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:36,050
permission like national land survey and

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:38,720
Finland Finnish Transport Agency then of

00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:43,300
course we have marathons and demos from

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:46,600
time to time we try to cooperate with

00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:49,459
human opens with my team in Finland and

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,310
different DG 20 stakeholders whenever

00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:58,070
possible because this not so much

00:15:52,310 --> 00:16:00,440
resources and for that and then at these

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:04,750
marathons we have some different mapping

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:08,240
pins and and events I have those are

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:12,470
examples have lists down there those are

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:16,579
links I hope you get this but maybe I

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:22,790
could choke one again for instance is

00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:27,070
adding buildings it's a link to actual

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,070
documents we use at the mapathon school

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,810
maybe not

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,330
maybe I'll go back to the prison so you

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,070
can't take the links I can and I can if

00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,730
you interest these I'm going to show you

00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:48,240
them later arms let's not get stuck with

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:52,200
that yeah and then of course we try to

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,930
edit through some data and recently we

00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,420
had a small import because we noticed

00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:01,620
that Swedish Road names in our area were

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:06,420
quite quite missing so there's some

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:09,329
information about that behind that link

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,370
and then we try to handle our monitor

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:14,699
changes we edit up always em ourselves

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:16,860
and we try to use our image notes to

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:20,730
crowd source mapping tasks and we are

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:24,689
also piloting with mapillary to take

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:27,660
Street street-level photos we have

00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:29,960
people driving around measuring stops

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,120
from time to time measuring stops

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:37,050
locations and distances between each

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,230
other so that's though those teams have

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:44,340
tried tried out Napoli and we try to

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:48,450
expand that with some other teams that

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:50,610
are on the ground south so to say and we

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,630
try to monitor changes as well we this

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:57,780
is a thing we just began with tested

00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:01,080
analytical different engine and maybe we

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:07,830
also should test over same chart haven't

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:11,100
done it until now at least validation we

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:13,710
try to use ready to use tools at all

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,340
smells and keep right because what's the

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:21,930
point in trying to in them to be for the

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:24,180
second time that we can use when we look

00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:27,240
at the geometry and self but of course

00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:31,650
then we also can compare all SM with

00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:34,470
other official open data for instance or

00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:38,070
all data or topographic data from the

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:42,300
National and survey or DG DG Road is a

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:44,900
Finnish Transport agency's official open

00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,120
data for the road data in Finland

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:50,450
and though I mentioned earlier that we

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:54,440
also used the public population register

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:57,200
Center address data for father has a

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,840
face data for the journey planner and

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:04,059
then there's also a service map data in

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:09,110
the Helsinki region for the service many

00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:13,580
municipal services like schools health

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:15,880
care and that control and one key point

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:19,090
in the validation it's of course

00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:24,140
providing the results to the open data

00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:28,370
community so they can so we don't have

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:33,350
to update all the data ourselves but the

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:39,020
less we find out so they can contribute

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:42,710
as well and this is a slide I draw out

00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:46,160
to maybe a year ago about this whole

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:48,350
thing that's validation ideas I had we

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,450
could use customer feedback that we get

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:53,720
from multiple channels process it and

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,340
filter in in a way and validation tools

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,770
we have different monitoring changes

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:02,230
discovering errors and comparing to

00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:07,130
reference data that could be one movie

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:10,070
feed feed for the task lists for always

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,710
an improvements and we could also use

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:15,559
the journey planner loss or listing

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:19,420
problem for instance you can find that

00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:23,600
someone or people are searching for

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:26,900
restaurants or points of interest that's

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,300
and they get they can't find it on the

00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,179
journey planet and we could use the log

00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:35,030
to report a page here's something that

00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:38,420
maybe should be on OpenStreetMap and put

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:41,030
it put it all up on the task lists of

00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:45,530
always improvements it's this list would

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:47,240
be like open list for ourselves but also

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:51,320
to the community that they can

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:55,340
contribute and this is more more or less

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,680
a vision idea the sound present at the

00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,990
moment so

00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:03,410
and the idea of

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:06,770
osm community manager at us that with

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,540
handle feedback and update OS M&A take

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,210
care of data in course and always in

00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:15,050
Bucheon let's see how that goes in and

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:19,790
so far we have haven't had it and or

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:23,060
some community management and I tried to

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:25,610
more or less manage these things at the

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:28,010
moment but sorry end up but we are

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:33,110
running out of time it's already no -

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:35,750
okay okay so sorry yeah I had some so

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:40,640
you can't finish in one minute yeah okay

00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:43,820
the problem comes in OS m the most of

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,780
these I already mentioned crowdsourcing

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:50,510
and ability to react on changes and cons

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:54,010
of uncertainty about the day data and

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:57,200
some was someone she touched on

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:59,690
challenging between developers and gif

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:04,280
prefer professionals formats and

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:08,090
standards and then challenging we have

00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:11,540
osm it's not perfect at the moment when

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:14,890
we thinking of is really one map style

00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:19,490
enough and in routine we also have a

00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:23,270
idea of the different rows that could

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,430
use that maybe we could have an accurate

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,740
more accurate classification for working

00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,980
groups and how do we take tagged

00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:33,950
invisible stops we haven't done that we

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:37,310
have some stop sets and in the future we

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:40,190
develop validation and schematics maps

00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:44,630
and digi transit try to develop walking

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:46,400
and cycling and maybe some other mapping

00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,790
projects as well and there are some

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,340
links to resources we have so sorry for

00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:58,490
thank you for the presentation

00:22:52,340 --> 00:23:01,940
[Applause]

00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,940
so questions

00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,180
hi thanks first of all thank you for

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,910
work I liked it

00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,630
you're great role model I think I have

00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,820
two questions

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,860
since you're towards our open source did

00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,660
you ever people have actually creating

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:26,160
pull requests or features and changes

00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,810
and second since you rely on opens

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:33,410
treatment for routing and map creation

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:37,260
we have problems with vandalism yeah

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,700
pull requests we have had those on the

00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,820
journey planner but not on these

00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:46,140
abilities that they haven't been so

00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:47,430
around for so long and so long with they

00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,630
haven't been so much

00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:56,570
vandalism deputy but that's as as I said

00:23:51,630 --> 00:24:00,380
we try to increase the increase the the

00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:03,180
validation just in case but so far not

00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:06,150
you know if any other places have taken

00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:09,380
a copy to use themselves of the software

00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:13,500
of the journey planner yes there's a

00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:18,960
Norwegian national journey planner and

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:21,540
