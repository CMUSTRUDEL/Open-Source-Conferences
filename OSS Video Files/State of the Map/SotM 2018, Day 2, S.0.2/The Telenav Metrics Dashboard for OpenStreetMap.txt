Telenav's OSM team released a new OSM Metrics Dashboard earlier this year. It offers weekly comprehensive statistics on the OSM map data. Unlike other metrics views that are already available, this new tool for the OSM community is focused specifically on navigation attributes like length of navigable roads, number of turn restrictions, and signposts. What is exciting about it, is that due to the big data technologies it uses, it offers statistics for the whole world, on countries, states, counties and even some metropolitan areas. In this lighting talk we will present what the dashboard offers via a demo, as well as some insights on how it works under the hood.

oh hello buddy my name is Adriana laser

00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,900
and I am from Tirana

00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,700
and in this lighting talk in this

00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:17,140
lighting talk I will talk to you about a

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,630
website we recently released called

00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:26,970
metrics dashboard so what is methods

00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:30,040
dashboard is a web UI where you can view

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,489
different metrics on osm they're

00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,690
actually 22 of them they are mostly

00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:39,460
focused on navigation attributes like

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,829
signpost speed limiter and restrictions

00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:45,659
I also added a link there where you can

00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:45,659
access it if you want to take a look

00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,979
metals dashboard offers weekly metrics

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:57,309
on on the whole world it's available by

00:00:53,979 --> 00:01:02,429
country county states and even some of

00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:05,429
the metros it dates back to February

00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,429
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:15,219
how did we achieve this first we wanted

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:18,820
everything to go fast so we chose to use

00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:23,979
Big Data technologies like a punch spark

00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:27,729
or a partial pocket for input we use the

00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:30,729
word PBS which we take each week from

00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:34,420
the one that the community released and

00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:37,060
we converted to a posh parka format I'm

00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,490
not sure if any of you are familiar but

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,549
for kids our tabular that data format

00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:47,439
that are very easily distributed across

00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:52,119
multiple computers so combine tweet

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:55,990
spark it actually we managed to get the

00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:59,560
metrics from PDF to live on the web in

00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:01,420
about 5 hours for the whole world I also

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,359
added a link there for you if you want

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,789
to download the packet Iser it's

00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,390
available on github you can use it

00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:10,420
yourselves

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:14,170
also we are publishing each week the

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,940
packets we obtain from the word PDF so

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,460
you can download yourself and make

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,610
queries or whatever you choose to do

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:27,280
with them okay

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,940
so at the end I'm gonna show you a small

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,090
demo

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,090
[Music]

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:44,129
it was without a mouth awesome so this

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,900
is the demo you can see the list of

00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,940
metrics you have there from you you can

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,870
choose signpost navigable roads turn

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,000
lanes and so on we added a small info

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,430
button for you so you can see exactly

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,760
how we computed this metric there's

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:03,159
details on what it means and also the

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,129
tox toys and talks we have used to

00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:10,269
compute the metrics I added in the demo

00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:13,000
the signpost metric this is a bit more

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:15,640
complex so you can see here we have like

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,760
nodes and ways and we combine them in

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,530
different ways so maybe this helps you

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,150
get a better understanding exactly what

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,650
this metric does and what are the

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:29,890
numbers okay

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:32,230
so basically if you select a metric

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:36,810
speed limit for example the graphic gets

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:40,209
loaded you see each dot it's a week

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,269
sometimes their data is missing because

00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,160
PBF is not generated by the community so

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,260
hence we don't have the data and you're

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:53,829
gonna be seeing that missing data that

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:55,780
that's what it means right I talked a

00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:58,419
lot faster ok you can see miles and

00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,090
kilometers there you can switch between

00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,829
them some of the metrics are don't have

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,310
mileage they are counted like tourist

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:09,280
section or samples of course so we have

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:13,150
a region picker there for us we have the

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,590
most regions County metros and so on we

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,690
have all the countries in the world a

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:25,090
variable for you let's choose for

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:28,020
example Milano so for for the rest of

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:32,080
the world just the states are available

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,500
so let's just Milano ok and we can look

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,630
a bit how the matrix looks like

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:42,220
navigable roads you get the graphic and

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:48,219
so on you also can go back in time if

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:49,740
you want so I chose for you Mays 2017 so

00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:50,940
if you want to look see

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,970
whether you can choose monthly for

00:04:50,940 --> 00:05:00,150
example or quarterly and that is it we

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:03,590
can encourage you to use it and give us

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,590
