The session will be about mental health care in the Philippines and the services available to individuals suffering from mental health issues in the country. I hope to introduce the map I have made for this cause which I called "Mental Health A-WHERE-ness PH". This map shows the locations of free and paid mental health facilities and services that offer help to people with depression, anxiety, drug and alcohol dependency, etc. I also hope that through this map, which could show the reality of how the Philippines fares in mental health care, those who have the power and the means to help teach mental health awareness and improve services in the country may be made aware of this situation.

hi good afternoon I just want to share

00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,730
with you the Mental Health Awareness map

00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:13,590
pH it's a map of where the mental health

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,470
resources and facilities in the

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,610
Philippines is so I made it this just

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:25,110
this May so it still needs a lot of

00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:27,210
updates anyway mental health so I'm sure

00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,550
everyone else already know what this

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,649
means so let me just show you a meaning

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,350
from the road a definition from the

00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:36,989
World Health Organization in the

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,530
Philippines however there according to a

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,940
report in 2014 by the W ratio there were

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,690
two thousand five hundred fifty-eight

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,359
suicide cases Hendren is 12 and 2.5

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,570
percent at one point seven percent male

00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:56,309
and female suicide rate respectively

00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:59,399
also one in five Filipino adults suffer

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:03,300
from psychiatric disorders and 10 to 15

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,940
percent of young children 5 to 15 years

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,850
old also suffer from a certain mental

00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,920
health problem and worldwide one in ten

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,479
young people experience as a mental

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,119
health problem so also these figures

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,990
these figures merely tell the story of

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:25,079
mental health and the Philippines so

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:27,119
what we do as mental health advocates in

00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,540
the country we encourage people to seek

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,189
help

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,460
so because it's important to talk about

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,829
mental health and get help early when

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,170
things don't feel right like what we do

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,969
when we have a broken bone so we go

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,710
directly to the doctor same with a

00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:43,170
mentor with mental health if we feel

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,659
that something is different let's we

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,609
encourage everyone to just seek help

00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,659
however there's a stigma on mental

00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:52,289
health

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:55,500
so 31% of people with mental health

00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:58,259
illness say they are afraid to seek help

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,670
because of the fear of judgment for

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:05,579
people I spray me I was a it was

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,679
actually diagnosed with severe mental ha

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,890
so fear depressive major depressive

00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,320
disorder in 2017 but I was too afraid to

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,790
to seek help

00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:19,750
even before I felt it and

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,650
2015 yes of the stigma so I thought the

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,510
help would be far away or it would be

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,159
expensive so that's why I thought of

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,010
making the maps to show where the

00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:32,109
nearest help yes there are actually a

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,530
lot of data from online sources even in

00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:37,420
on reddit and other the unready but

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,900
there's a whole thread about it but

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:44,049
those are just lists so I I thought that

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,230
if you make it into a map you would what

00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:50,349
could easily tell the locations so

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:53,470
here's the map it's a map box version

00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:58,030
and this is a card to one so if you

00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:01,659
click on a point there the user can

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:04,239
easily see the name of the facility it's

00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:07,870
address contact details the initial fee

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,079
if you first go there and the succeeding

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,209
fee for the next appointments and there

00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:15,310
some some points I'll also have

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:19,180
additional information like what to look

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:22,979
for the psychiatrist that you could

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:28,780
contact and if it's also LGBT friendly I

00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:32,199
also added a map concept page it's osm

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:36,150
based so other users could add points

00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:38,829
that they think could also help so but

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:43,620
the points added here can still be

00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:48,790
validated before added to the actual map

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:51,579
for new users like there I also added a

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,810
fake use and contact sites and how to

00:03:51,579 --> 00:04:00,159
use the contrib map concept page there

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:05,530
so in the future I also wanna encourage

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:09,400
people to add to add tags for mental

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,889
health facilities there's actually most

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,949
of the points here are already tagged as

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:17,259
amenity hospitals but we could refine

00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:21,829
them more into adding health specialty

00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:25,219
to mental health there thank you

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,219
