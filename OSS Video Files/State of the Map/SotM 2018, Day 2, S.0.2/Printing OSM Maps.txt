There are a lot of online services that produce nice maps from OpenStreetMap data, but only very few that generate output suitable for printing. This talk is going to present MapOSMatic, a service that produces large scale single and multi page high resolution maps.

MapOSMatic produces large scale maps in PDF, SVG or high resolution PNG format. Map data from OpenStreetMap is rendered using customizable style sheets, and optionally combined with extra textual information, like a street index for the visible area. Output can be a single page map, or a multi page book-like atlas.

MapOSMatic has been around for quite a while, but development had stalled a bit over the last years. Recently the project has been taking up some speed again. The talk will present both the basic features and some of the recent additions, programming and style sheet tweaking, and how to run your own instance.

yeah hello so my name is Albert I'm from

00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:19,400
illa birth Germany I studied computer

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:24,019
science and directed engineering not the

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,240
mapping of the suite map since 2007 my

00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:29,480
day job is to work as a database support

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,680
engineer for Maria that is not related

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,410
to this topic here so in the past

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,660
whenever I moved into a new city first

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,629
thing I did muffler was to get a city

00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:45,320
plan and have that hanging some very

00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:49,160
prominently on the wall I just get my

00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,899
way around and I still do that in the

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,199
flat I'm living now for the last 10

00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:57,170
years so this is the official city map

00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:01,339
of my place

00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:04,040
but I also got a pretty large printer

00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:08,180
for a good price a few years ago so it's

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:11,810
in a 1 to 60 by 80 centimeters good

00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:16,430
enough for posters and so I try to use

00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:18,560
that for printing OpenStreetMap maps so

00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,200
this is a neighborhood map of a place

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,170
where I live and on the side you can see

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,940
in index of some points of interest in a

00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,470
neighborhood like traffic stops and

00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,470
restaurants stuff like that

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:38,630
I originally did this for some social

00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,390
places especially erected in shelters a

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,960
few years ago in Germany the Alamo

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,610
refugee is coming in sports halls were

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,290
converted into shelters and stuff like

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:53,120
that the original plan was just to have

00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:57,020
city maps there but you can see in

00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:00,560
cities pretty large area so there's not

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,360
much detail on the matter and it's often

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,230
a road map you can see much more of the

00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:09,229
local places of interest and so how do

00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:12,430
you get an app printed first thing most

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,540
plan a let's just do a screenshot

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,390
obviously it doesn't work for lot of

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:21,249
solutions for print

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:24,889
so we immediately step to plan B that

00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:28,969
was to use the export feature we have on

00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:33,739
the OpenStreetMap website we can select

00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:38,239
a map area export that area as PDF or

00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:41,870
SVG or bitmap to edit it further but

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,790
that still had some issues like you only

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,469
have the standard OpenStreetMap style

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,739
they're not even with three other styles

00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:51,219
that are on the website and it's pretty

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:54,919
hard to get the right aspect ratio for

00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:58,310
full good print and to choose a good

00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:04,579
scale factor so we continue to look for

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:09,349
other solutions and so we've ended up

00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:11,689
with fusing baws map automatic that is a

00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:16,280
project that was originally started by

00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:18,560
developers in France and it uses the

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,049
same map make the rendering stack that

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,790
provides over both stiffness also uses

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:27,829
so you can use the same style files and

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:33,169
it has a pretty easy to use web

00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:38,209
front-end you can could use or single

00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:42,109
page maps and can also export them in

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:45,620
PDF or SVG format so you can host edit

00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:49,849
them and can optionally have a street

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:54,849
index on the side and it can also

00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:59,389
generate multi-page Atlas like booklets

00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:02,449
but that was the last interesting part

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:04,430
unfortunately the development of the

00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:09,169
project have already mostly seems when

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:12,439
we started to use it so it had the sort

00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:13,759
of DOM and for few years still using a

00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,909
pretty old version of the Open Street

00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:20,060
Map responsi for example what was worse

00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:21,620
was from time to time the service would

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,770
seem to be offline and by now it is

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:29,050
totally offline

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,050
so as this all was of the source

00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:40,379
that's your own instance wrong with also

00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:42,509
about a year later really work so a few

00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,669
of the changes we did on the way was I

00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:47,389
didn't come today was he's not using

00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:49,919
up-to-date versions of

00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:52,019
pieces in the US to obtain like

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,330
up-to-date version of magnet up to date

00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:59,279
slightly it's mostly and I provide in

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:04,529
larger collection of style sheets we see

00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:08,729
that later and I added a feature to add

00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:14,909
overlays and pop up them up lady are

00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:18,509
also added upload for GPX parts and for

00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:23,969
you Matt part and will of smart stuff

00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:26,909
and I run my own server now so this is

00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:31,529
just a quick walkthrough of our beside

00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:34,249
words like on the sweetener export you

00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:36,749
can either select just the bounding box

00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:39,329
but if that doesn't perfectly fit your

00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:42,629
paper it's automatically extended

00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:44,999
horizontally or vertically to fit the

00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:50,669
available area so the solution is always

00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:55,919
white one for the paper size you have or

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:58,019
you can search for city name and if we

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,479
have the city boundaries in office we'd

00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:04,199
map and if the area is not too large

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:09,919
depending you get it in the auto

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:13,050
completion box there mark and black then

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:17,639
the software knows from the city borders

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:22,860
or big area for map and is going to be

00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:26,249
and concept automatically or a third

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,949
choice you can upload a GPX track and

00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:33,629
this is a preview of the track loaded

00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:35,879
for testing and that's how the rendered

00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:38,959
we saw it looks so it's little more

00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,959
standing out color wise

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:47,700
or you can use you map service to draw

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:53,100
map and when you save it you can save

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:58,560
the for map data the web interface of

00:06:53,100 --> 00:07:01,680
you map and then you can import it into

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,540
map into the print service here again

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,350
you only see a simple preview just the

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,890
map area features without style but one

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:13,920
the actual map is rendered the color is

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:18,120
and I can attributes of markers and

00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:23,850
stuff from new map are actually used in

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:27,330
the print version so when you have

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,400
selected your map area either directly

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,660
or a city name or by an uploaded file

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,960
the next step is to choose the layout

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,640
which can be single page or multi page

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,530
within a single page you can choose if

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,660
you want to have a speed index on the

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:49,320
side or on the bottom then you could get

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,410
choose the map style or literally there

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,750
were more suggested is the juice from

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:59,400
now it is a list they've got a bit

00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:01,470
longer so I try to use as many of the

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,430
sauce mattnic style files as I could

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:07,890
find and to get a little preview in

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,050
there on the right hand side the preview

00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:12,420
is not for the map area you selected

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,010
it's just the pre-rendered preview that

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:19,560
you get an idea what the style looks

00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:23,640
like and you can also on top of the map

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,610
star you choose add some overlays which

00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:30,410
are drawn on top they're just drawn in

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:33,150
the order they're on the destitute later

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:39,360
overlays on the bottom of the list yet

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:42,420
drawn on top of the earlier ones then

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,940
the next step is that you get a

00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,940
selection of possible paper sizes for

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:51,480
the area you choose so the larger the

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,410
area or the smaller that I can get

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,410
because the smallest

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,630
and the larger the paper format you

00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,430
choose the more details you will have on

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,860
the map as the zoom level is going to be

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,480
higher and you can obviously choose if

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:13,590
you want to have a portrait or landscape

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:16,650
mode and in the last step you can add or

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,960
change the map title and you can choose

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,810
the language but for now the language is

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,320
only for the copyright notices on the

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:27,090
bottom of the map it is not changing the

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,400
language used when rendering the actual

00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,890
map data with one exception

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,710
in the drama map style we have some

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,080
experimental support now created by

00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:41,550
sueños the maintainer of the german

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:44,070
website that allows to render actual

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:49,110
city and sweet names in the selected

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:51,390
language if they are available as

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:55,680
rendering may take a little while

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:57,560
depending on how large your print job is

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,430
and how much other jobs are in the queue

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:05,820
you can give the site notification email

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:08,220
address when rendering has finished it

00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:12,120
would send you notification mail with a

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:15,300
link to the results I only keep this

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,840
email address for 24 hours in case there

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,870
are happy problems with rendering after

00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,540
24 hours the address is purged again so

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:30,720
no permanent storage of personal data

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:32,130
there yeah this is just giving through

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,230
this because they don't have the time

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:40,410
this is just the selection of different

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:43,320
map starts I can provide if this is

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:46,530
special one for for skiing areas that

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:52,860
can render those skiing routes and the

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:55,350
live stuff like that this is an example

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,150
of an overlay that gets drawn on top of

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,480
the map this is the first one I

00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:06,260
generated which shows of fire stations

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,260
and fire hydrants this is

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:14,620
we have limitation of the open fire map

00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:17,260
style this is just a simple example of

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,770
these maps map overlay looks in a map

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:26,080
maybe just has a style rule or to draw

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:30,840
the symbols and in SQL query that fix

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,840
the fire hydrants out of the database

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,890
there are few more Vanessa have one is

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:44,400
for Mac speeds that uses the same color

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:47,110
as in to a max speed map and we have

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,050
which my wife was especially asking for

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:53,950
an overlay of hiking routes it is using

00:11:50,050 --> 00:12:00,820
the same style as the way mark trade

00:11:53,950 --> 00:12:03,910
side for a half month this is a special

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,340
one this is an overlay that uses the

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:09,070
same style as the surveillance on the

00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,970
surveillance website which renders the

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,710
viewing areas of non security cameras so

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,350
yellow circles these are dome cameras

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:21,190
where they don't know what they actually

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:23,860
look like look at which you can turn 360

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:28,810
degrees and there is one way you can see

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:30,760
it just looks vacant this plug-in is

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,900
actually this table is actually special

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,610
as the map Nick render it does not have

00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:41,860
any way to draw circles or specially

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:44,140
circle segments so what I did here after

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:48,960
you some experimenting with map Nick

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,960
plugins and finally giving up is that I

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,240
provided my own little or added my own

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:59,290
little plug-in interface to the render

00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:02,080
service itself this allows instead of

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:05,260
using or a map like net map next

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,110
actually to directly draw on the map

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:13,650
result on top of the map you solve with

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:16,520
a pie scenario graphics functions so

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:20,100
yeah this is

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,070
let's skip it for now and as an

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,210
alternative interface you remember the

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:28,130
neighborhood plan I showed in the

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:31,130
beginning so for this I have created a

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:35,130
small extra JavaScript front-end

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:38,760
that's easier to use as he only set here

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:41,700
points of interests for the area you

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,990
want to have enable a plan for it is

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:48,660
even a little visit that picks out

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:52,320
interesting points like traffic stops

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:56,280
and pharmacies and stuff form using the

00:13:52,320 --> 00:14:00,180
overpass API for the area and when

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,800
you're done setting all the markets want

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,250
to have printed you just used to bring

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,610
it icon on the bottom on the left and

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:10,380
you get your plan rendered so that all

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,740
the markers fit on it you don't have to

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,330
choose paper size it's always in a1 you

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,840
don't have to bake orientation or

00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:21,630
anything you just said all the points of

00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,060
interest you want to have and get your

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,700
map Willis markers and your index on the

00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:33,990
side with the list of markers where to

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:38,010
find them and what also did is setting

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:42,570
up and testing this stuff was quite a

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:48,320
bit of work unfortunately as you need to

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:48,320
have all the style sheets installed and

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,790
you need all the slides installed you

00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,590
need to have all the software setup you

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,380
have OpenStreetMap data imported into

00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:01,860
the database so I try to automate that

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,500
as much as possible and reasons finally

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,470
running your own instance might be that

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,640
you want to test the own style sheets

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,820
that you want to have something that

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,610
works offline without internet access so

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,620
we can have it all locally or if you

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:20,220
want to keep your results what you want

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:23,840
to print private because this side keeps

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,430
everything often listed in the public or

00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,360
if you want you to do development and

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,620
bug fixing mode

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,670
what's my main focus

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,380
so for all this you need to setup

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,110
mattnic you need to have those five

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:40,279
sheets you need to have extra data for

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:42,500
the coastlines or elevation data for

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:47,829
contour lines still fading if you want

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:53,060
that you need a bit more data imported

00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:55,480
into both this and you have to set up a

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:59,660
web server and the jungle web interface

00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,949
and so to make all that work out of the

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,810
box

00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:07,730
I created fragment setup starts virtual

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,290
machine and then there's all the

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,680
installation all the downloading and

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:15,620
everything or volume the only thing you

00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,250
have to do is you have to pick the

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:22,490
statement area you want to have rendered

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:25,550
for example take area download from the

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:30,019
area fabric download service rename that

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:34,089
to data dot awesome tote PDF and fire up

00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:36,829
the virtual machine then depending on

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:39,680
how big your machine is an awkward

00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:42,740
internet connection is after half an

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,519
hour to up to several hours you have

00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:50,149
your own instance running can experiment

00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,750
with it or break it or anything you want

00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,750
to do with it

00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,410
yeah that's pretty very available now

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:03,380
but it is creating an image that is too

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:09,559
large to provide the actual virtual

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:11,900
machine image so it builds it up itself

00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:16,030
and from does all the downloading your

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,030
side and

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,260
No

00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:28,240
yes a lot of nerd is printing out the

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,640
street map data is possible but it is a

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,700
bit more challenging than just preparing

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,440
data for the screen as you have to deal

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,720
with different resolutions

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,090
you can't just easily zoom in to paper

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:46,090
as you can do on the street color on the

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:50,920
screen it is not as easy to set up a

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:52,540
story to know how to suggest it but in

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,730
the end after taking a bit more time

00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,360
than learned it finally worked

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:01,990
I don't think it was worth it further

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,880
plans I have now is for one is do you

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,419
have localization work for all the

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,669
styles so I have to patch all the other

00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:13,720
side needs to support the same locus of

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:20,020
localization functions as the German

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:22,360
style or in dance I want to have an API

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,630
that allows to submit render jobs

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,290
without using the web front-end so you

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:31,390
could build alternative upfront ends or

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:36,520
tie it into your own services to

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:38,650
generate prints I want to extend the

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,960
plug-in interface I did so that it kind

00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,720
of only drawn on top of the map what

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:49,870
also can you provide your own index

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:52,150
sidebars using custom Python code now

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:55,960
also three things that are not yet

00:18:52,150 --> 00:19:02,380
solved technically one thing is I would

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:05,799
like to provide higher density resolute

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,419
intensity for the PNG exports but that

00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:09,669
runs into a hard limit in the Cairo

00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:11,740
graphics market because there is a limit

00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:14,290
at about thirty two thousand five thirty

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,809
two thousand pixels if something is

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,700
larger than that doesn't work anymore so

00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:22,390
for the real large paper formats I have

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:25,960
to reduce the DPI for for the written up

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:28,440
output but not for the PDF and for the

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,440
s50

00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,980
then what I would like to have would be

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,500
neighbourhoods Maps like you have on two

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,100
snaps sometimes we're not Moss's up but

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,020
the direction you aren't looking into

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,690
but map like unfortunately does not

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,520
support rotation the most experimental

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,070
patch for birth but that was lost when

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,090
they moved to a new bug tracker and

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:56,910
nobody seems to be able to recover that

00:19:53,090 --> 00:20:00,750
and I had started to look for a print

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:02,669
shop that would accept a random map so

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:06,980
we can say okay and now send this map to

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:11,280
this print shop put in my order data and

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:14,190
have that printed but the two shops are

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,169
trying to contact the app would only be

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:21,120
interested people if that would generate

00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:24,390
at least 50 print requests a day I have

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,010
like under rendering requests per day

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,049
but not everybody would use the

00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:35,540
commercial service to print this so this

00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:40,500
is not realistic so yep

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:43,620
yeah okay that is the end of my material

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:48,919
and now it is time for questions or

00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,919
suggestions or notes from your side

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,600
[Applause]

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:01,890
thank you for the presentation I had

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:08,669
find you I mean thank you for the

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:10,380
presentation questions oh but why I also

00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:14,929
have some example prints here if you

00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:19,830
want to see them try to grab see later I

00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:22,559
am managing the open Shiva Belgium tiles

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,870
over I would like to know if you would

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,360
be interested to have all my pick styles

00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,880
for your tool because you had so much

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,370
sorry I can't understand so I'm managing

00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:37,290
the OpenStreetMap Belgium tile server

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:39,179
yeah so we have all mopix tiles and you

00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:43,650
know just wanted to know if you would be

00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:45,860
interested to implement of those in you

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,860
too

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,140
yeah okay no that would be great

00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:55,260
okay perfect yeah I can send that be

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,260
thank you

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:16,280
I envy your application there a

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:21,510
possibility to Brina exactly scowl like

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:26,430
100 or 5,000 meters so not by a zoom

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:31,850
level but I label that's also stable to

00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:36,020
do this the will the scale factor gets

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,020
auto-populated so it's never really a

00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:43,980
good number like one two thousand to ten

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:46,410
thousand what I do have is I have one

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:52,050
overlay that puts in a state of art in

00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:58,559
the bottom and so the map square is

00:22:52,050 --> 00:23:01,800
always 100 meter 150 250 500 and then

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,679
thousand and so on to the square size of

00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,750
the map grid is it's a good fixed size

00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:16,260
you can work your distance from but the

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:21,320
scale is it not usable are you thinking

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:26,220
to bring from vector tile source sorry

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:30,420
are you in the future in you know preen

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:33,030
vector tiles source because many of the

00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:35,490
problem with the raster and solving

00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,410
printing vector tiles the problem is

00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:41,700
that I totally rely on the map Nagrand

00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:43,860
right here and as long as map neck is

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,830
not able to render it from vector

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,470
toilets so it is able to produce vector

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,450
tiles for client-side rendering but in

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:55,140
itself does not understand vector tiles

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:57,240
to produce bitmap from that so as long

00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:01,350
as magnum can't do that or a similar

00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:06,170
library I will not be able to implement

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:06,170
that thank you

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:17,259
you can knock okay mattnic can read

00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,289
vector tiles and render them so you can

00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:23,950
in fact quite easily include like open

00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:26,139
map tiles service and even get one of

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:29,879
the 55 languages for the printing on

00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:32,649
your server while using open map house

00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:35,950
it can react the tiles directly from

00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:38,710
SQLite and style them to standard way

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:46,499
produce any of the outputs instead of

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:46,499
reading from post GIS you read from so

00:24:52,379 --> 00:25:01,409
any more questions okay so thank you for

00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,409
the presentation

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,029
