OSM Streak â€” makes you map every day by giving out precious points. How many people fell for it, and how can it be even more fun?

hi everyone Amelia's video and this is

00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:17,029
not my github as it was three years ago

00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:19,189
so you see there is matrix of activity

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:22,220
when you made some contributions to give

00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:24,699
up and there is a streak which means the

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:27,880
number of days you have met

00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:30,650
consecutively without gaps

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,520
this is Pascal's how did you contribute

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:38,510
page it also has metrics of activity but

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:42,500
it is missing one thing does matter what

00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:44,719
so when I saw this I thought wouldn't be

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,480
wouldn't it be great to have a

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:52,489
completely filled activity back to X so

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,480
for that I needed to map every day and

00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:59,210
how do i make myself map every day well

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,320
first option is to find somebody to wake

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:06,100
maybe with a stick when I don't map and

00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,950
there is another option to give myself

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:13,310
virtual points when I send a change set

00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:16,850
of course the second option is better so

00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:19,490
I built or a same streak or SM streak is

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:22,520
a website that gives you virtual points

00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:26,659
when you submit a change set and when

00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,939
you submit many changes for several days

00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:32,049
straight it gives them more even more

00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:34,430
points like if you submit for a month

00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:40,399
consecutively then you get five points

00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:42,439
for each also there are levels some also

00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,750
virtual levels like when you met for

00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,049
three weeks straight you get to level

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:56,180
three and get some more tasks and more

00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:58,490
stars right of course you could just map

00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,909
one building each day and be done with

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:05,869
it but to make things more interesting I

00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:10,459
edit tasks every day you get some random

00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:12,830
random tasks that asked you to use maps

00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:16,710
me to map 20 buildings to improve a

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:19,980
coastline and so on but I found 32

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,400
in the project and the higher your level

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,140
the more different tasks you get for

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,780
tasks you get an extra point and nothing

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,660
more

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,370
so how did it go at first I was making

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,320
everything and you have seen on Mac

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,010
tivity graph that some part of it is

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,590
filled I missed some days which means I

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,360
got back to one point per session couple

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,060
times and then I got tired of it

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,340
so it's kept it turns out virtual points

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,150
don't work all the time but they work

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,840
half the time good enough what about all

00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,450
the users around 400 users registered

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,890
you know SMC around hundred go to level

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:08,550
two which means a weak operating and

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:12,720
less and less top users is almost at 100

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:16,080
and 1000 to 500 points but recently he

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,170
lost his streak so instead of getting 15

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:24,050
points for exchange set now here's one

00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:24,050
so I think he's very disappointed or she

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,910
this is a chart for top 40 users how

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,200
they participate so you can see some

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:36,720
users join and map map map all the way

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,260
some users get read very quickly and

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,500
that different petals like blue bars are

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,210
where users complete tasks and you see

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,910
at the top some users that complete

00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,430
every task

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,830
these are languages site is translated

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,040
to multiple languages most users use

00:03:52,830 --> 00:04:01,340
English of course but the next Perl

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:05,730
language is Japanese some reason and

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:11,910
maybe in means some tasks rather strange

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:15,060
like tasks that urges you to send a

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:18,049
change set with a simple word to fix in

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,600
the comment or just that makes you map

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:24,960
both in jail and in Kamchatka in the

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,210
same change set which has got quite a

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,750
lot of issues with a same change

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,920
satellizer works

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:36,750
so I have some ideas on how to make my

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:42,400
streak longer and maybe more firmer like

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:44,200
automatically look for change save that

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,320
submitted without me visiting your site

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,090
it's not very good because I can find in

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,190
three years that I finally go to level

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,520
five even forgetting about tourism

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,250
streak and I'd like to be more involved

00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,160
I go to partner with commentary and team

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:04,300
to use tasks from them but they have

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:09,190
very big tasks right

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:11,050
I could add a lot more levels like one

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,720
for every week draw some pretty pictures

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,850
and stuff I could use experience from

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,220
Pali mappers who did advent calendar the

00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,780
December and make it some kind of

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,020
awesome tutorial and so on

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:26,970
so I'm open to suggestions if you have

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,970
