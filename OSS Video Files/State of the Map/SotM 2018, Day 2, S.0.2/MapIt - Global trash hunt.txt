I am part of Let's Do It! World movement. My vision is a clean and healthy waste-free world. We are now building a trash-tech platform to 10x the movement & inspire the next 100s of Millions join in the World Cleanup day on 15th of September 2018. Mapping the waste beforehand helps the communities to see where all the mismanaged solid waste is located in order to prepare for the action day and mobilise people. MapIt campaign is about collecting mismanaged solid waste data through a simple app and citizen science. Most active period is from April to August 2018. First version of the World Waste Platform http://opendata.letsdoitworld.org/ The overall aim of the World Waste Platform is to analyse and visualise the data, to make the waste problem visible around the world.

good evening everyone I mean gift good

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,360
afternoon still I'm Chris this is cadre

00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:15,719
and you're from well clean up day and

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,240
what we're working on is basically

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,810
filling all this map with trash we want

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,650
to build the biggest most ugliest map in

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,600
the world and we have a lot of help 150

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,000
countries already active on this map you

00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,369
can see the yellow ones so these are all

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,040
countries that have national teams that

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,540
are today doing mapping they started two

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,270
months ago or three months ago the

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,310
spring yellow and light yellow ones as

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,640
well so only the white ones are missing

00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,680
yeah exactly so all of these countries

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,130
are already mapping and they are mapping

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,140
until 15 of September this year and this

00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,970
is the world clean-up day when all of

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,450
this trash will try to clean it all up

00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:01,710
so on 16 September this year the planet

00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:04,049
will be a lot cleaner it's by our count

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,370
the world's biggest peaceful civic

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,530
action to date and obviously trash is a

00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:14,100
huge problem and it actually it's

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,290
affecting about 9 UN's sustainable goals

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,330
so if you can solve trash around the

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,830
planet you are we have solved you know

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,350
nine of those goals but how do we get

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,780
there the big problem today is trash

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,340
blindness because people who are living

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,140
with trash you know day in day out

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,970
they're actually quite used to it so you

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,619
might go out and don't even know this

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,460
trash on the street you know in the

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,110
forest in the seaside so you know it's

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,729
kind of just there and you don't think

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,350
about it so much so how do we make

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:48,990
people see that trash we great a huge

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,170
map as I already said but we cannot do

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,360
it even alone you know with 150

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,150
countries if you only had our our app

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,970
which we have we have actually 20 or

00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,470
more apps that people are using around

00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,299
the planet in different countries that

00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,640
are localized for their own needs for

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,959
their own languages and culture and you

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,030
know whatever and all of that data we

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,739
our goal is to get all of that data onto

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,090
the single map you know obviously you

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,020
can see we are using Open Street Map

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,620
here

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,720
for cartodb and all of those thoughts

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,030
are actually different types of trash so

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,270
what you're also trying to do is get the

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,520
type you know that is it plastic is it

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:35,190
that some kind of other type of like

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:37,440
rubber or whatever and yeah so

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:43,350
Kadri will give you more details about

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:45,630
that yes so this this map currently it

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,000
is already there's data from eight

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,790
different apps so and we are currently

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,480
creating the collaboration with my Chris

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,530
said around 20 and the main goal goal at

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,240
say let's do it believes in

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,450
collaboration and partnership because

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,010
hello we cannot do anything so we have

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,080
our own app which is like let's say

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,200
creative for the purpose of world clean

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,850
update but we also see that it doesn't

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,560
really matter what people use it's

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,390
important that it's open data it's

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,090
openly available that anybody can use it

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,800
later on also for researches so that's

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,720
that's the goal and these are the

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,430
partners we're also looking for it's

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,620
also important to say all of that code

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,950
for these applications also on github so

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,810
anyone can forget can improve its offer

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:33,510
yeah so I will show you a video from our

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:36,210
Nigerian team which is about mapping so

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,260
I will show a few examples and this one

00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:41,550
yeah

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:45,930
my name is Maya me and I will do it

00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:48,450
Nigeria I'll tell you about the work

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,640
clean up hop and it really might be the

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,210
same because if we help you to map data

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,430
and trash it against September 15 2008

00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,680
sent to the workman update all you have

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,460
to do is go to your Google store is

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,660
store type the world what we know enter

00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:10,500
in downloaded

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:15,360
voila yeah so this is we are like let's

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,070
say also collecting different materials

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,950
from our community which is working very

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,989
similar to osm community and this is an

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,360
example from Tanzania for example where

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:27,330
actually the hotel SM team is doing the

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,060
mapping where a spell di is during doing

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,730
the cleaner so it's a huge partnership

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,380
partnership there is a few more pictures

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:39,180
from from Tanzania this is Slovenia

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,730
which is actually the map of India

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,860
created by trash points so Slovenia is

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,760
one of the most mapped country based on

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,250
waste that we have currently this is

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,630
Romania and in case of Romania they have

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,220
already like direct links to local

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,800
municipalities so the local

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,690
municipalities are obligated to clean up

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,980
the waste in two months when a citizen

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:04,169
reports it and well Indonesia is a great

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,260
example because there's like 17,000

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:09,270
Islands and it's already mapped we

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:13,590
started in April so that's quite crazy

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:15,690
and the question does always see me the

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,070
mapping team for trash as well will you

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,520
guys go out with the map that's right

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:23,160
with us yes awesome

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,140
okay then what a great one yeah so all

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,540
of that started in Estonia ten years ago

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,120
and now we're here with hundred fifty

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,220
countries which is awesome you can

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,720
download the app for Apple from the App

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,430
Store and Google Play and there's

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,169
everything available on github if you

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,540
want to help translation it so I'm proud

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:42,180
in there's a Facebook group just Google

00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:48,930
as you'll find us thank you thank you

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:51,150
it's not often a rubbish map gets a

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:56,370
round of applause so um well we switch

00:05:51,150 --> 00:06:01,580
over to the face of osm in to go oh did

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:06,450
we have some are here Burma meter AMI

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:16,950
nope that means it might be my top when

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:22,790
we think the next one isn't here is

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:22,790
there a question of a trash map

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,060
so I have a question so based on your

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:52,100
database which country is the most

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:53,690
wasteful sorry so currently let's say

00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,420
that were cleanup day is kind of a pilot

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,660
in a way that we are we started in April

00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,370
we are collecting their initial data

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,360
based on this data currently we cannot

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,940
say what is the most wasted most trashed

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,590
country in the world we have to create a

00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,720
baseline as the first thing and this

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,720
will be done after the world cleanup day

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:25,850
do you know what happened with the trash

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:30,640
the volunteers collected is it just

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:33,470
moved from one place to the trash dump

00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,730
sorry what was the question what

00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,760
happened to the trash the volunteers

00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:41,600
collected it just one place to another

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,080
okay so we are I'd say that what happens

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,460
after is based on local communities

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,890
because the sorting everything is

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,660
different in each local community this

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,060
means that in some countries it is

00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,270
actually moved to one big dump site

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,980
because it is proved that it is better

00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,810
to have it at one place than scattered

00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,120
around where the wind can take it ocean

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,160
or rivers can take it to ocean when

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,290
there is plotting so but on other

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,620
countries it's basically every every

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,350
country has agreement with local utility

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,120
companies before the world cleanup day

00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:16,840
one thing to add to that is that anyone

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,310
who has already gone out map trash or

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,020
participated in the cleanup probably not

00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,680
ever going to put any trash in the

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,680
