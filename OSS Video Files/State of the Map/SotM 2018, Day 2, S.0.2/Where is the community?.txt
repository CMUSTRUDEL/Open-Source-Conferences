OpenStreetMap is a global community that is comprised of multiple smaller local communities that make OpenStreetMap what it is. One of the challenges that everyone who is making efforts to interact and connect with the communities are facing is that each of the local communities has its own communication channels and caters to a unique audience. How do we make sure to reach out to everyone in the community?

This talk will focus on highlighting the different communication channels that different regional OSM communities use

Trends around these communication channels
The audiences that these channels caters to
The limitations of having multiple channels - whether the fragmentation of communications channels both within and between OSM communities make it more, rather than less, difficult for people to interact with each other
Possible ways of bringing them together and bridging this gap
