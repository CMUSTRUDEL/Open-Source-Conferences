Hello SOTM Team! My idea is to quickly dive into a project conducted with the European Commission on mapping the EU budget spent worldwide. Three parts: data collection troubles with public institutions, mapping result, policy impact of the mapping study. At your disposal to discuss this.

thanks a lot so this is about presenting

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:14,580
my consultancy my mapping consultancy

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:16,859
based in Brussels and on the left here

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,150
you can see a Milano statue of another

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,950
da Vinci the principle of what I what I

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,850
try to do for the last what I have tried

00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,369
to do for the last two years is to merge

00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:32,279
humanity's with mapping technologies I

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:36,810
come myself from history and from

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,660
political science and I tried to improve

00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,970
the way I was analyzing things by doing

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,570
statistics and geography and then come

00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:50,489
back to this policy sector with new

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:53,700
ideas and new methods so the work is not

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,379
going to surprise you there's structure

00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,700
in the data set clean it sometimes

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,860
visualize it and then what we sell is a

00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,309
map usually a density map or a

00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:11,490
correlation map and an analysis around

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:16,740
around those maps I have three case

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,500
studies to show you one is a case study

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,900
done for the European Commission about

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,780
where their money was spent abroad so

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,330
every year European Commission spends 4

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,869
billion euros in Africa in the Middle

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,759
East's in Asia and every time when you

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,460
read the papers you Commission papers

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,420
they say our top priorities is Africa

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,390
and the Middle East

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,060
you know it's the Le Monde language as

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:47,100
we say in in French the reality is that

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,380
use money is actually spent in a in a

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,909
much more broader way and this is what

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,950
we have shown with this very simple heat

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,979
map and they were surprised by the

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,640
way--by hits because it shows that a lot

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,640
of used money is actually also spent in

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,770
America and also in Asia and it showed

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,269
that many member states are actually

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,840
diverting some of that money for

00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:14,189
national causes let's say so this was a

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,230
case only number one and then you have a

00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:19,920
correlation matrix

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:23,099
so on the top left that we did right

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,930
before right before mapping what we try

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,560
to do with this correlation matrix is

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,620
cross the money spent by the EU with

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,610
World Bank indicators on poverty on

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:39,019
unemployment on migration to see if the

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,819
money spent by the EU was matching

00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:44,040
emergencies issues that we see around

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:48,750
the world according to the World Bank

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:52,079
data sets case 2 D number 2 which is

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:55,560
which is ongoing is try to understand

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:59,370
better what the elections of next year

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:04,459
in Europe are going to are going to tell

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:09,209
us all of this is of course respecting

00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:13,160
use standards about the way data is

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:17,730
processed here it's about understanding

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:23,069
the sociology and anthropology of the

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:26,130
voters next year and a third case study

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,889
which I'm also currently working on

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,599
right now is try to quantify racism

00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:34,620
across Europe so this is a project that

00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:40,829
is almost pro bono because this is for

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:42,780
for an NGO and this is a complex data

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:47,549
set which I which I cannot share right

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:50,549
now but we have columns about X racist

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:53,480
and anti-semitic acts around Europe and

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:56,099
then we have more qualitative data

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,829
pulling data for example which is a

00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:02,040
which is open source and also data from

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:05,599
from the NGO the purpose of this is to

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:09,180
try to form to build an index to measure

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,000
for each European country its level of

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,669
racism and anti-semitism I gave you this

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,099
example by the Institute for economics

00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:20,579
and peace this is a map they've done

00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:23,130
yeah ok this is a map they've done to

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,050
measure violence across the world from

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:28,020
one to five of course the redder it is

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,940
the more violent the country is this is

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,050
a little bit what what I'm trying to do

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:37,650
now for racism so this is my background

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:40,190
on on the top and it so it's a very

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:44,700
public policy background and my purpose

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:47,400
coming here is to meet someone with data

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,310
scientists background with both strong

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,330
statistics skills and geographic skills

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:58,650
to expand on projects that have already

00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:00,000
started and that are going to to arrive

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,220
in the incoming months

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,810
thanks a lot and if you have any

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:15,090
questions I'm and they're there any

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:22,950
questions well at me the first map is it

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:27,030
per capita or per location ah you're

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:29,940
right now I'm going to be frank I do not

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,090
think that we have that we have done it

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,340
Birkett no I don't think we have been as

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,290
you know that we have this level of

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,110
precision that you that you mentioned

00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,180
I'm not remember us having done having

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:49,050
done this but so it should be done

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:50,400
definitely well it's still interesting

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,750
it's an interesting to see where the

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,790
money is going but you're right it would

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,300
have been even more interesting if the

00:05:53,790 --> 00:06:02,790
numbers would have been as soon as it

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:04,710
would have been well / by the population

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,430
figures definitely crossed with

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,430
