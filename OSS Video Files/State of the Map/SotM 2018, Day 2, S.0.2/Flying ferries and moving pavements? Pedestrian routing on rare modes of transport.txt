Some modes of transportations are only present in cities with big geographical obstacles like rivers, valleys, hills and cliffs: funiculars, moving bridges, cable cars, elevators. Routing engines tend to ignore or misunderstand these. I will discuss possible routing algorithms, and how we can adapt existing methods to use them.

okay so yep start so some of humanity's

00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:19,580
most beautiful cities were built on

00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:23,220
geographical topographical obstacles

00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,580
next to clips or valleys or Bay's or

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,529
rivers and it makes a lot of sense if

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,300
you're a nice building a castle it makes

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,410
less sense if you're just trying to get

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,760
to work and it's 2018 so I'm going to go

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,100
through the infrastructure we've

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,790
invented to to get over those obstacles

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,330
and city builders have been quite

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,690
creative and inventive and because a

00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,400
very expensive we tend to only build

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,490
them where it makes a lot of sense and

00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,960
so because of that significant mappers

00:00:53,490 --> 00:01:00,240
tend to map them well unfortunately

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,590
rooters tend not to really understand

00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,580
the advantage it could give to

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,870
pedestrians and either ignore them or do

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:13,260
not handle them as well as they could

00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:17,720
and as you'll see it can be easier in in

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,720
some cases and less easy in other cases

00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:25,500
so a very quick refresher on how routing

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:29,340
works you take your osm database you

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,600
boil it down to the things you can walk

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:38,790
over which I represented as as green and

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:43,500
blue here and then you assign a score to

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:48,180
every edge of your network and then to

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:52,409
get from from work to school you are you

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:57,860
simply well simply you find out the path

00:01:52,409 --> 00:02:00,210
that would have the lowest score and

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:04,290
well how do you assign the score is that

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:07,110
well that is not always easy for better

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,610
pedestrians do you want do you want to

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,249
spend less time do you want to spend

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,459
less energy do want to spend less money

00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:15,989
so routing engine authors usually strike

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,470
a compromise between all of the

00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:18,450
different

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,120
as in which this is also why you get

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:29,190
different different results from

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:32,550
different engines the a very common one

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,240
is ferries and routing engines tend to

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,950
handle them quite well we have more than

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:42,240
20,000 in the database and the one that

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:44,910
interests or pedestrians are mostly the

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,390
short ones like typically less than two

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,930
kilometers that go over river or over a

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,480
lake and this one crosses the harbor in

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,790
Hamburg in Germany and it carries more

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,430
than nine million passengers a year

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,990
so quite significant and how do you map

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,940
them it's really easy you connect your

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:09,870
road network on both sides with a way

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:12,570
that you tag as root equals ferry and if

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,750
you have more than one points you have

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:21,150
the terminals map mapped as a ferry

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:23,580
terminal almost every other routing

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,709
engines I've seen they can understand

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,500
ferries and they deal with them quite

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:31,050
well and I think we can adapt the

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,010
routing engine profile so that the

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:42,090
unsupported modes of transportation are

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:44,700
handled a bit like fairies for example

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,630
this one that's extremely rare there are

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,730
12 transporter bridges over the world

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,870
and so you build a toll bridge over

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,060
typically a harbour and then you have

00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:02,820
don't know if you can see it does that

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,860
most no here you've got this platform

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:09,090
that is being pulled across back and

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:12,570
forth over the bridge and this one is

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,209
near Bilbao in Spain I'd save you 10

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:18,720
kilometer detour if you had to go up the

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:22,200
harbour take the ferry and go back it

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,560
runs 24/7 and it cost 35 cents for a

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,169
pedestrian and is it a fairy flying

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,750
fairy not really it's a transporter

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:34,440
bridge

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:36,690
but people have tagged some of those

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,030
bridges as fairies because it tends to

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,790
do what we wanted to do for the routing

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,520
so there's one in Middlesbrough in

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,060
England that is tagged as a fairy is it

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,030
correct

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,300
not really other people have tagged them

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:54,750
as as highway equals good way or service

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,250
or path doesn't does it make sense if

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,880
you want to route over if it's tagging

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,800
for the renderer so I think that Reuters

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,320
and renderers should understand this

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,420
tagging of bridge movable equals

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,360
transporter on a bridge equals movable

00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:17,070
and just treat it as a ferry synonym and

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:20,850
that would work well enough a way more

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:24,180
common one piece of infrastructure and

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:28,620
it's also mapped in a similar way you

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,990
just have a way and it's it's escalators

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,030
and travel laters I thought that were

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:37,490
just like for airport terminals you have

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:40,710
those long travel agents but this one in

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:43,110
Hong Kong is is a very important piece

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:47,910
of pedestrian navigation SimCity's use

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:50,640
them as it as outdoors pieces of

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,170
infrastructure and so if you want to do

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,390
it properly in Hong Kong you have to

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,820
understand the this one this called the

00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:01,710
central mid-levels escalators and they

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:04,590
carry 80,000 passengers a day and so if

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:08,580
the conveying tag is present on on a

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:11,730
highway you if you are a routing engine

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,980
you should understand that maybe people

00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,020
are going to move a bit faster and maybe

00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,610
set to score that's a bit lower because

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:23,100
you can just stand there and move and

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,990
some routing engine and sign a penalty

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,760
if you go over the steps but I don't

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:34,680
think you should have a penalty if the

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:37,350
steps are moving you up and like that

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,420
you should also show on the navigation

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,030
you take the elevator or take it take

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,610
the

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:50,240
take the steps moving steps take the

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:54,050
moving food way another very common

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,700
piece of infrastructure and I've just

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,220
used tag info for the counts I don't

00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:02,030
know how many are inside outside that

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:06,050
we've got more than 17,000 lifts and the

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:08,720
tagging is very simple you have the node

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:14,600
and you tag it as highway equals

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:16,640
elevator and routing you could if you do

00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,320
it neatly and just ignore that tag you

00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,540
might get it right because it's usually

00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,500
a very short way instead of having to go

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,750
up and down we'd take the shortest way

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,400
and that usually gets you there that the

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:33,950
problem with that is you might get the

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,420
time wrong because you have to wait for

00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:39,170
the lift and lift ache sometimes to get

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:43,370
you up or down and it would also miss

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:45,410
the advantage of sometimes you it makes

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,500
sense to take the lift down and then go

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,090
back up a bit or go back down a bit and

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,480
then take the lift up and go back down a

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:56,390
bit again to use less energy and it

00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:03,200
might be a bit longer in kilometres but

00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:05,480
it might be a lot quicker and this one

00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:10,880
is Lux is in Luxembourg where I'm from

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:13,010
and you can see that we dug like a niche

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,510
into the hill this used to be the hill

00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,790
so we dug into it

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,890
and then there's this huge pillar

00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,930
concrete pillar and the lift goes up and

00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:25,130
down alongside it and there's a bridge

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:31,280
at the top that connects the top of the

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:34,490
lift to the park and I was bugging

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,610
Richard who's over there because this

00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:41,210
didn't work in in cycle dot travel his

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:45,530
cycling routing and I I couldn't

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:48,530
understand why and it turns out that his

00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:52,070
his routing engine was too clever by

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:53,940
half and it it understood that this was

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,440
all connected

00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:00,990
but it looked at the elevation and be

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,240
the elevation model just had a big cliff

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:09,960
there and it didn't know that it had

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:12,510
been dug into it so adding the adding

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,550
the incline that the module understood

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,020
that the lift was not halfway up on the

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:20,370
hill that was at the bottom of the hill

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:22,560
and that made sense to the engine what

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:26,220
the what the engine did correctly

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:30,720
assumed was that the bridge at the top

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:34,560
was straight you sometimes see routing

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,020
engines they that you think oh yes I'm

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,820
gonna use the elevation module and then

00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,790
they just follow it on sticking to the

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,060
ground and so you have in the view of

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,890
that module you have a bridge going down

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,360
the cliff following the bottom of the

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,580
valley and then going back up the cliff

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,850
so routing engines need to understand

00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:58,740
that bridges are usually straight not

00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:00,510
always flat but straight unless you have

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,020
an inclined tag on it

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:07,230
I would tag it with an incline tag if it

00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,690
has like in New York you have bridges

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:17,960
that go up and down so that ships can't

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:21,990
go underneath them the difficult one is

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:25,530
funiculus can we have a show of hands of

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:32,640
who was at the public transport tagging

00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:38,339
talk this morning yeah a few so they're

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:43,170
tagging is is difficult to to work with

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:46,680
and people have tagged funiculars using

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:48,720
that that's FEMA so you have I've got

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,800
the red dot there that's tagged as a

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,480
stop position and the two arrows the one

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,940
in the middle between the track people

00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,030
get onto the train and the one on the

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,520
left there people get off the train so

00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:07,050
the one in the middle is tagged as

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:10,820
platform entry only and the one on

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:15,839
on the left is tagged as exit only

00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:19,050
so it's not always connected to the road

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:25,620
network either the platform so you need

00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:28,830
to invent ways virtual ways that create

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,870
virtual connections between the bestop

00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:34,290
position in the middle and the platform

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,630
and on the other side of the platform to

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,810
the from the nearest platform to the

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:42,120
nearest point on the on the highway

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:47,910
which I've just represented as a as a

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:51,660
line over there and then once we have

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:54,450
that we can navigate the pedestrians on

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,060
those virtual ways from from the highway

00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,649
network to the platform from there to

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,200
the stop position where they are on the

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:03,920
train we can treat the Train as a ferry

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:09,870
and do the same again on the other side

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,610
and we can also apply this to people

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,860
move is like you might have taken them

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,600
from from one airport terminal to the

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,730
other they tend to be tagged in a

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,680
similar way there's one here in Milan

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:25,770
that takes you from from metro station

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,890
to a hospital so they appear all over

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:34,170
the place and they're really useful when

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:35,579
going around and there's another way of

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,310
tagging those of course it'd be too easy

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:41,579
if we just had one way people have

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:43,680
tagged them as highway equals elevator

00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:47,370
and connecting that to the road network

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:53,880
and so this we can just just treat as a

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:55,140
ferry there's when when tagging

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,000
structure tends to be used for

00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,740
funiculars and the others for inclined

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,190
elevators I had no idea what the

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,290
difference was funiculus tend to use two

00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:07,380
cabins and one as a counterweight and

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:10,020
this is an incline elevators because the

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,570
cabins are independent they each have

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,600
their own Kanter weight as far as I

00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:18,329
understand this is the difference it

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,080
makes little difference when you use

00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:22,780
them though we have different tagging

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,730
schemers for them and this one is

00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,830
actually declined elevator but people

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:30,730
call it the funicular in more maps in

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:33,460
Paris and it carries around four million

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,930
passengers per year and when it closed

00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:41,110
it closed for a few months in 2006-2007

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:43,480
shopkeepers complain that that income

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,690
was down 20-30 percent so it's really

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,460
important to that part of Paris and you

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:52,050
have to get it right if you want to do

00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,050
pedestrian navigation in Paris

00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:01,060
we've also mapped areal ways in

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:05,380
different in different ways also by

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:08,640
tagging the the end as nodes or

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:12,730
buildings and using something that is

00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:15,490
almost but not entirely and like the

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:20,760
public transport be to schema that would

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:24,640
be too easy and we can easily treat them

00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:28,090
from from cable cars like this organ

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,100
dollars that are smaller and they do

00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:32,740
tend to be used in cities this one is in

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:36,580
in New York and there's one in London

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,530
and I'm sure there's many others so we

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,120
can easily treat them that as funiculars

00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,400
as well it doesn't matter if you're on a

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,900
rail or on a cable so we connect to them

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:53,140
like a funicular and then the thing

00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:55,870
itself we treat as a ferry and on the on

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,080
the user interface this is just a

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:02,110
mock-up we should let the users decide

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,890
do you want to do you want to use the do

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:08,550
you want to if it costs you something

00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:11,980
most most ferries cost something most

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:14,320
lifts do not cost anything but we should

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,620
let the users decide if it's worth it or

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,730
not

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:23,770
and let the users decide what they what

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:25,360
they want to navigate on it would be

00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:29,130
especially important if here in a

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:34,590
wheelchair to have this kind of

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:38,730
of navigation option that's it it was a

00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:53,940
short talk but thank you and I'll take

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:57,510
your questions so firstly I think very

00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,010
very interesting talk actually I work on

00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,070
some parts of routing but more

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:04,530
traditional like just car like etc

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:06,050
routing yeah yeah we tend to do cars and

00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:10,230
I think oh yes we've solved the problem

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:11,690
so so just curious like all this work

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,070
that you've done

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:17,010
maybe I've missed this but like is this

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,750
available in some pedestrian router all

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,640
this work that you described like I know

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,230
you mentioned that you know we've been

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,390
doing this etcetera like I'm just

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,300
curious like is this available somewhere

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:29,220
for us to try out it's not available to

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,960
try out because I'm not sure this is the

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,450
right way of doing it which is why I'm

00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,100
talking about it and I'm hoping some

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,810
people will come up in the organ and say

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,130
you're doing this the wrong way you've

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,320
misunderstood the whole thing you should

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,600
be doing it this way so it's not

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,800
available yet some stuff would be quite

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,170
easy to to add to to the route is like

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,810
the transporter bridges that's just a

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,460
few tags to add to the profile for the

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,650
funiculus to have the virtual

00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,630
connections while you're pre-processing

00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,880
in the model I would have no idea where

00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,850
to start in the most common routing

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,550
engines and just an extension of this

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,550
question so for pedestrian routing is

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,819
there any like osm based open source

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:13,920
route or that you would recommend that

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,420
like for us to let's say try to do some

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,689
of these extensions ourselves or like

00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:22,319
maybe shouting in general what engine do

00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:27,050
you recommend to try other than the most

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:32,030
common ones seem to be grasshopper and

00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:37,590
OS RN there is a nice tool by kinetic

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:39,210
are you there who compared all those

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,180
different engines and says oh this is

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,510
good for this this is good for that

00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,210
there is

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,260
Valhalla and I do know people are still

00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,600
working on it

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:53,130
people had made mad Zen we're doing that

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:56,790
it seemed interesting and there's a few

00:17:53,130 --> 00:18:07,050
other smaller ones but yeah Oh SRM and

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:09,990
grasshopper are the two big ones I'm

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:12,210
also doing a routing engine and I'm also

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:15,390
doing very routing and I'm sorry I can't

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:18,750
hear I'm also doing routing engine and

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,130
I'm also doing very routing yeah my

00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,020
question is do you know that there is a

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,650
fundamental difference between a ferry

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:28,710
and a moving pavement because that in an

00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:31,140
F a step in a a star route ah you have a

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,120
routing constraint which needs which

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,580
says you need some sort of maximum speed

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,070
otherwise a star cannot be efficiently

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,400
and this is no problem for a ferry

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:46,230
because Larry does not make you a high

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:48,990
speed in the routing if you want to do

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:51,000
moving pavement then you want to get the

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,830
effect of the high speed and then you

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,250
have the problem with sips our star

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:59,700
constraint and you lose much performance

00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,290
in the European algorithm so this is why

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,730
I think there's a fundamental difference

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,620
between the ferry and the moving

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,530
pavement because the moving pavement

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:10,320
this is more or less optimal working

00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:13,290
it's all s sorry this is public

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:19,890
transport routing which is a different

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:25,980
problem so I see that it could be on the

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:29,550
on the border you know is is a there is

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,860
one moving pavement tagged with V equals

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:35,130
yes cluster Moscow I've no idea if this

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:38,790
is true or if it's a mistake there are

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:46,950
funiculars that are free they are lifts

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:50,790
that are free do do is is it all do do I

00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:55,890
care as a pedestrian if I'm going from A

00:19:50,790 --> 00:20:01,410
to B if if my routing engine has

00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:05,250
look at it in some way or another III do

00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:07,920
see that if you were going to look at

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,450
public transport and you say I'm going

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,640
to do public transport route and then

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,940
you need to handle all the lines and you

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:18,270
can get off at more than one stop and

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:23,130
you need to handle their schedules and

00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:28,070
that then that's one thing but a ferry

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:32,940
that would move all the time or and but

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:35,610
stairs that go up 24/7 would for me as a

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:44,490
pedestrian be definitely in another

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:45,990
category I'm not sure I mean I'm not

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,030
sure we can

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,580
I understand the difficulty you're

00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,140
describing that it's a completely

00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,170
different bag of beans if you're looking

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,120
at a ferry where speed doesn't matter

00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:04,050
and a moving walkway whether it's speed

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:06,960
does matters it's just that the the

00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:09,210
routing engineers that's not just a

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:16,200
misunderstanding textbook but there's

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:20,600
also fundamental algorithm could you

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,600
could you see another way of solving it

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,810
sorry could you see another way of

00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:29,850
solving it then then that's to to

00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:36,060
understand as a routing engine moving

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:37,860
walkways or or things like that yeah of

00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,620
course you kind of do it the same way as

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,360
transport working it's just mm-hmm

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:52,590
something that needs more computing

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:54,330
power I cannot do it on a mobile oh yeah

00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,400
I was going to ask a very similar

00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:59,310
question which was to what extent is

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,560
this a special case of what the

00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:04,800
transport routing mentioned a couple of

00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,170
times the public transport talk that we

00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,270
had this morning should we be taking

00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:12,330
lessons from how public transport is

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:16,950
mapped in OSM for mapping this kind of

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:22,650
feature you know I think the end goal is

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:24,810
to have if I want to get from A to B I

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,760
want to say okay I can cycle I can take

00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,530
that I can go by foot so now I want to

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,480
have all those different options

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:35,610
available to me as a human and I want

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:40,830
the computer to do the job of comparing

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:44,490
of different modes and and combine them

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:47,520
if that's possible I realized that that

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:53,580
is a tough problem for or a routing

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:56,010
engine the the difference I've to go

00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:00,300
back to to your question the difference

00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:04,410
I see between between public transport

00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:08,730
and smoothing infrastructure tends to be

00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:11,970
very short tends to be free or very

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:14,670
cheap so cheap that it's you know 35

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:20,100
cents I don't think you can buy anything

00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:21,540
else but 35 cents in that city okay and

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,110
it tends to be really important for

00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:28,020
pedestrians you cannot be a pedestrian

00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,670
in in some of those places if you do not

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,680
understand those pieces of

00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:34,280
infrastructure you can live a perfectly

00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:39,450
happy life without ever taking the bus

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:41,280
you cannot succeed as a pedestrian if

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,210
you never take those pieces of

00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,590
infrastructure

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,080
sure sure I get that that's actually

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:49,230
brings to mind so if the first thing you

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,570
mentioned was parents and I think I've

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:53,450
got noted down here that you had 20,000

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:56,809
219 varies

00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:59,779
I looked at quite a lot of them doing

00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:04,070
the routing for cycle docks Apple and

00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:06,919
I'd guess probably 19,000 of them could

00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:10,039
be mapped better and the two things that

00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:13,100
I see a really common that would be a

00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:16,190
good way of improving ferry mapping one

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,990
is one is just plain mistake which is

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,590
very often the Prarie terminals aren't

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:23,570
connected to nearby roads or they are

00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:26,450
connected but the access tacks are wrong

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:29,450
so it's kind of quite often I'll see for

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:31,940
example a ferry terminal which is

00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,460
connected to the nearest road by highway

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,440
full service surface equals driveway now

00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,649
I don't route down driveways because

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,779
it's usually Saunders driveway so they

00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:44,059
do need the access tags but something

00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:45,710
I've started doing with cycle travelers

00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:50,419
I sort of encourage other people to do

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:52,970
it is breaking out the URL tags or the

00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:54,529
website tags on ferries because usually

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,360
when you see that your route takes you

00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:58,549
over at Larry you want to know well it's

00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,470
the ferry running today is it going to

00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:02,809
cost me a load of money I don't want to

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,120
rock up to the ferry and find that it's

00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:08,029
only runs on Saturdays in the summer

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,159
months which some do so actually putting

00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:12,169
the town of the website of the ferry

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,690
operator in there which the routing

00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:16,460
engine can then serve this is a really

00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,100
good way for people to get around this

00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,110
problem that sometimes that only doesn't

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:28,460
really fit in your room and now I think

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:31,970
we can see a virtual circle of engines

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,429
understanding the bits of infrastructure

00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:38,740
they're done not to complicate it to

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:41,899
understand and tagging getting better

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,880
like you assemble some of those things

00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:47,600
I've seen you could it would be hard to

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:55,130
root over them and you could easily make

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:56,840
them beautiful it's it's hard to debug

00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,610
because you don't have anything that

00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,610
navigates over it so you think

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,460
it's there's no more questions thank you

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:15,549
very much

00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,549
