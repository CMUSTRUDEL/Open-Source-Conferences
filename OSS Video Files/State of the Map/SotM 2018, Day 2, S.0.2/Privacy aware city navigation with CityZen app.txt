	Redon Skikuli (CityZen app), State of the Map 2018

Navigating our cities using free software community based mobile apps in 'private mode' might sound like an easy task in 2017, but with a little research you will be quickly disappointed. There are related platforms out there, but some of them are lacking good User Experience, others are not community-lead or are getting away from the free software freedoms due to their partnerships with companies that do not respect our privacy online. These are only some of the reasons the CityZen app was born in Tirana, as an OSM based Android app that helps us navigate our cities without tracking our location and activities. At the same time the app offers easy mobile optimized OpenStreetMap editing for easy contributions on the go. CityZen aims to be empowered by the community in terms of development and promotion and as a digital wallet for cryptocurrency used to make payments for goods and services from POIs easily through the app.

everyone hello this this means Russian

00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:16,010
daddy a person Didier in Albanian means

00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:21,170
hello and in many languages I think I

00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:23,630
guess first of all I'd like to this is

00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,240
my first state of the map I've never

00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,360
been to any of the other editions before

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,079
I've seen some material online but so

00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,290
far it's been amazing and very thanks to

00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:40,070
the guys that have organized it and the

00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:42,650
volunteers it's at being an organizer

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,500
myself I can only imagine how much work

00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:48,079
it's being done behind this and after

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,160
the conference as well so thinking so of

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,170
two words about myself I am based in a

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,960
city I was born in a small city called

00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:02,860
Elba Sun it's it's quite a small city in

00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,180
a small country not much things to do

00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,960
the only thing I really enjoyed when I

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:13,370
was a kid behind like playing football a

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:17,030
lot from day until my parents coming out

00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:20,450
shouting about going in but also my home

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:24,080
was next to the train lines which also

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,630
is connected with my fascination and

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,010
interesting in train systems and this

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:34,070
interest in the train systems also made

00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:37,119
me understand that I'm really fascinated

00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:41,540
with systems how things work in general

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:45,770
I don't know if you any of your dad is

00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,810
plays around with like train models of

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,400
trained rail systems but it's quite

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,439
quite interesting and it's also

00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,900
connected to things people do in

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,580
technology in general because starting

00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,990
from the operating system of a computer

00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:01,939
to of anything else it's related to one

00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:05,090
system connected to at the other systems

00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:10,159
and how these things connect together

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:13,880
this is a soviet-era main machine and

00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,140
it's actually right now there are only a

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,780
few of them left

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,820
and hopefully they're gonna keep it so

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,690
Elbasan is that I mentioned before is in

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,180
in Albania

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:27,860
it's very closely it's like one hour and

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,520
a half by plane from from Rome and

00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:34,240
something more for me from Milan and

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:38,180
it's quite a due to the fact that it's a

00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,310
it's a small country and other reasons

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,840
they're not much as I mentioned before

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,209
there are not much things getting

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,370
produced there as well so the only

00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:51,170
interesting thing in fact if you have

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:58,250
not been there is that before 1991 we

00:02:51,170 --> 00:03:02,890
had a very close resistant was kind of

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:06,070
paranoid he builds more than 170,000

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:09,709
bunkers waiting for the enemy to come

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:11,270
any enemy that with us out there you get

00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:13,010
if you travel around you can see I met

00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,010
some people there were have been in

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:18,680
Albania cycling before and it's quite

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,570
interesting in my opinion as one of the

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,970
things to see and you can see them in

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,130
the mountains but outside the sea as

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,560
well so it's also the home of tough

00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:32,239
macaws which is a very non healthy food

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:34,190
based on yogurt and meat yet the yogurt

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,310
is baked and it's also some of a

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:40,610
trademark of the city I mean I was

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:43,489
sharing this before because for for me

00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,470
personally every time I've been to quite

00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,989
some conferences related to free and

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,519
open source Vince and technologies and

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:53,330
for me it's very interesting to

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,860
understand what people do in general and

00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:00,470
the most important part why they do

00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:01,820
these things and for me I think one of

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,769
the elements was the train system but

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,650
not the other one was also the fact that

00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:11,180
I moved to Athens in the late 90s with

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,650
my family in and I was hanging around in

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,860
our neighborhood called exarcheia

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,930
exactly as home of the very of a very

00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,510
big community of people that are very

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,650
politically engaged in one level or the

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:26,840
other and going to these places to do

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,849
these meetings although I didn't know

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,279
what might my interest was knows

00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:32,899
I started understanding that in general

00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,800
in life it's very important to these

00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:39,020
things not not work because you need to

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,789
work but also to do things in a certain

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,740
way because you believe to do them with

00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:48,800
this all these lessons in mind I went

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,629
back to Tirana in Albania and co-founded

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,999
overlaps hackerspace which actually is

00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:56,679
still the only hackerspace active with

00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:59,749
young mostly young people I'm one of the

00:04:56,679 --> 00:05:01,669
oldest there hang around and play around

00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:05,240
with any kind of technology it's a very

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:06,709
small space mainly we are interested in

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,729
open source free and open source

00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:12,199
technology and and any kind of thing

00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:14,749
related with that we play a lot with

00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:18,769
open data with we fight for all-night

00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:21,999
privacy which is not very easy to do in

00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:24,439
in Albania another stuff this from AHA

00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:27,229
this from a crypto party we organized

00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,639
last year we have a yearly conference

00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:32,659
called oskol open source compress

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,839
Albania and we a lot of people gathered

00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:35,599
there

00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:39,379
one of the projects that we are heavily

00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:41,539
involved is also OpenStreetMap and in

00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:44,749
the beginning I started editing over

00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:47,659
Sigma in 2012 I was not very interested

00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:51,319
I just want to learn the technology and

00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:54,129
what's behind it and during my day time

00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,930
I was using Google Maps or other

00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:59,809
services in general and this is the this

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,929
is the page my OpenStreetMap page in

00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:07,879
English until 2015 the edits are quite

00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:10,009
at a low level 2016 I started getting a

00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:11,659
lot of attention and I was one of the

00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:14,179
reasons was because because of the fact

00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:16,339
that I saw that there are many many open

00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:17,800
Street club projects around them some of

00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:22,159
them you can see are the info book booth

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:26,569
outside maps that me or a cement my

00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:29,659
books which is also a very interesting

00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:34,039
project and I found it fascinating that

00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:38,089
a layer like Open Street Map can empower

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,569
such so much things that are very very

00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:42,839
different between them

00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:46,099
people that like to buy buy to go to to

00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:49,860
use the bicycle can use dedicated apps

00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:51,270
but what I found is that my conclusion

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,909
was two things first of all these you

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,749
can do also yourself interesting stuff

00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:59,459
with using OpenStreetMap data but also

00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:01,800
the majority of the apps that they

00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:04,740
actually where they're had things that I

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,629
didn't like they were kind of like a

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,369
swiss knife some of them had the

00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:11,279
tendency to put all the things together

00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:15,180
and just save your life with all the

00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,589
features that are there so as I

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:22,139
mentioned before I were quite amazed on

00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:24,990
on what you can do and I two years ago I

00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:29,699
started not only editing more but also

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:31,949
trying to explore ways of utilizing the

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:39,179
OpenStreetMap data in a very very

00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:41,699
interesting way 1 2016 and and that

00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:43,499
year's in three to two to three years

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,849
before I also started going as I

00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:47,039
mentioned too many free and open source

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:52,499
conferences and I was staying to hotels

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:55,919
and other places Airbnb and and usually

00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:59,999
I had this needs to us all of us I need

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,949
to find some water before at a late

00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,709
night night in the day you know in the

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:06,839
evening or have like go to a drugstore

00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:09,659
grab some like pain killers if you if

00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,339
you if you need or other services that

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:13,889
you don't there these are not brands

00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,930
like McDonald's or other stuff these are

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,149
services that everybody needs and I

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,550
couldn't find usually when you go to

00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:22,499
services of a street map but with based

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,409
or other services proprietary ones

00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:28,349
usually you you know you you know how to

00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:31,829
go from point A to point B and you know

00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:33,839
what the point B is so what I needed was

00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:35,250
something that you don't know you know

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,829
the service that you need but you don't

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:41,370
know what the destination but the brand

00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:44,670
is so usually this is a project for

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,990
people that travel from big city in big

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,709
city of leaving big cities but also

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,610
travel to big cities as well and for me

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:55,779
also privacy is very important

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:58,269
there's a huge discussion from with

00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:01,480
political elements now related to

00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:04,240
privacy from face book selling data and

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,820
helping for the brexit campaign but also

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,980
getting involved with the u.s. elections

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,959
there is all I'm not talking I'm not

00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,870
just not starting about Google and

00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:18,310
whatever happens with our personal data

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,070
there so I'm very concerned about this

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,950
and traveling to especially to two

00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,360
cities or countries in the central

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,010
Europe but don't know not only like

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,839
staying in Berlin for a while I

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,300
understood that that there are a lot of

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,670
people like me and I was not the crazy

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,829
guy in the in the room that was

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:39,040
interested in this kind of in the

00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:42,339
privacy elements and also I wanted to

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,320
start editing more but not from the

00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:46,420
browser or other tools I wanted to add

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,029
it from my phone so these were the three

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:52,899
things I thought I was very interested

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:55,240
before starting the project by the way

00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,550
as you might know editing OpenStreetMap

00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,620
by phone it's not a very easy task

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,390
because you need to the screen is very

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,940
small and you need to you can do a lot

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,459
of stuff but only certain stuff not all

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,180
of those so the project needed to be to

00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:12,640
have some rules one of the rules as I

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,980
mentioned before is that it needs to be

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,510
something that is community led this is

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,040
what I learned from my days in Athens

00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:24,970
right and of course free and open source

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:26,170
base privacy oriented you cannot have

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,079
online privacy

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,880
we know that 100% but this needs to be

00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:34,930
something that we will try to have it

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,579
out there and also respects all the

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,060
contribution all the contributors

00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:41,230
equally some projects respect more the

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,310
fact that we are contributing to the

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:48,160
code some others and they don't and they

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,380
don't find it very interesting that you

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,709
are doing a poster or design or stuff

00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,420
like that

00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:54,730
Oh a lot of open free and open source

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,980
projects do this they validate more

00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:01,899
people that are into the technical side

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:06,030
than others or community based so

00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:08,190
citizen was the name of

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,170
I guess it's obvious but if it's not

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,840
it's like relating the cities and the

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,080
fact that we need to be chilled about

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,970
finding points of interest that you are

00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,330
you are interested in so that's why the

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:25,440
same doesn't so it's a companion for you

00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:28,080
for your needs to the city and mainly

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,150
big cities but I'm not only right and

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:38,490
also tries to respects your privacy the

00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:40,260
as much as it can we launched do that ad

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,270
droid for you that for people they don't

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,520
know it Android is just like Google Play

00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:48,660
for Android but it only has three and

00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:50,340
open-source apps and one of the reasons

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,090
is for privacy reasons

00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:58,500
so f droid doesn't know how many what

00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:00,060
apps you have installed or when when

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,730
where are you or you don't share any

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,120
kind of sensitive information and the

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:08,640
majority of the apps that are on f-droid

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,160
usually do not ask for more permissions

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,590
that they need to I don't know if you

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,200
have this feeling when you install them

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:19,830
Android on an Android app on Google Play

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,680
they ask you for anything like who you

00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:25,400
dated when you dated it why political

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,540
like all of these things of course

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,370
f-droid

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,500
is based on Android and Android doesn't

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,570
respect much of our privacy but that's

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,160
another discussion and as I mentioned

00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,900
before privacy is very important and

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,490
that's why we're only on Android right

00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:42,210
now we understand that it's not very

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:46,010
convenient but having read all these

00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:49,530
things about what these companies like

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:53,400
Google and Facebook do with our data we

00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:55,590
will not go on Google Play at least for

00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,320
quite some time so this is the early

00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,780
version of the design it's quite basic

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,530
and it's done with not a lot of

00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,980
resources these were the furthest you

00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:10,590
can get transportation gas stations for

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,960
drugstores ATMs mobile phone and markets

00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,030
and kiosks again these are things that

00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,590
you probably will need if you are

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,790
traveling somewhere or you are living in

00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:21,300
a big city and you need

00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:24,170
if you are going out of your jaw or of

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,220
your work you

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,170
there are many drug stores you don't

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,110
know they're around you right so we now

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,480
have a new version that has more

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,650
services that you need and categories

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,260
bakeries pastries restaurant fast-food

00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,800
cafes bars transportation parking gas

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,680
stations

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,380
bike rental financial services financial

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:47,070
services our banks and ATMs markets

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:49,980
which are supermarkets and also very

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,210
like in Germany they have Spidey's the

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,400
small mini markets there in the

00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:56,640
neighborhood shopping which might be

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,230
shopping malls etcetera so if you go in

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,590
one of these categories since we're in

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,990
Milan right now I choose bakeries for

00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:07,410
the ice cream and you can see the what

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:10,920
is around you in that area and also you

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,360
can see them on the map if the

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,000
information is an obvious treatment we

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,550
can also see that that shop is closed or

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,500
open so the status of it if there is not

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:22,100
an obvious trick map you don't get it

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,420
and also if you click on one of these

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,790
points of interest you can get all the

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,130
information that is also on open street

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,900
map not all the information only the

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,180
information we've now put only the

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,310
information everything is relevant

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:39,510
usually what I do is I use the phone

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,520
number two in Tirana when I'm in Tirana

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,400
and use the phone number to call for

00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:48,780
example for food or or restaurants that

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:52,340
I need food in my place there is also

00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:55,110
information like wheelchair axes etc etc

00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,460
one of and if you click on directions by

00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,460
car which is the only thing available

00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,950
right now you can see how to go to from

00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,990
point A to point B by by car with the

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,940
directions so there are the categories

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,490
you saw map search favourites and

00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,170
they're bad search so if you search for

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,700
again we are in Milan if you search for

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:15,990
ice cream the quality of the ice cream

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,960
is going to be great everywhere you go

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,270
but you can also go and see some of the

00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,300
things that are around in your

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:26,790
neighborhood at that point of where near

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,920
during research if you go on the map

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,929
section you can also check

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,049
did your location but I can also add a

00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:38,079
new point of interest on OpenStreetMap

00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:40,749
directly from the app if you have not

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,609
logged in the first time you can login

00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:45,910
using the interface which is not very

00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:48,579
nice this let's let this be between us

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,230
in terms of the design but it can be

00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:53,499
improved so you put there your username

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,389
your password and you have a new points

00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:59,019
of interest with the basic information

00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:00,939
name address phone website email and

00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:03,509
also you can put the opening hours which

00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:09,220
in my in my opinion are very important

00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:12,519
if it's open 24/7 or from Monday to you

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:18,189
can check also the day the time the days

00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:19,839
when this is open this is in general the

00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:24,160
app as you can find it right now there

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:28,149
is a big list of improvements that can

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,799
be done but in general in general this

00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,259
is the what we have right now it's only

00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:35,139
a one-year project and it's a we're

00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:37,929
doing it at our spare time with some ups

00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:40,199
and downs in between we are in the

00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:43,059
Balkans which means in summer things

00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,470
turn up to move more slowly and we're

00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:46,629
going on vacations but in September

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,959
we're going up we're going back again

00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:51,669
working on it so if you get if it since

00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,029
this is a voluntarily based at the

00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:56,679
moment project how we can get involved

00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:59,259
there is all the code is published on

00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,879
Mozilla public license which is free and

00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:04,120
open source software is categorized in

00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:08,439
free and open source software and you

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:10,899
can go on the get on github.com slash

00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,589
citizen up and I'll check all the

00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:18,039
repositories one of the repositories the

00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:21,579
Android code and you can go there and

00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:23,230
improve you can check the issues but

00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:27,159
also improve the code by yourself by

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:31,000
sending opening a new issue this these

00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:34,840
are some of the some of the things you

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,880
can also improve the website the website

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,539
is created by github page by using

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,850
github pages which means that you can go

00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:43,299
and github and open a new issue and

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,179
we're going to

00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:49,539
you can fix it and send it to us or

00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:52,840
improve it yourself and of course you

00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:55,239
can you can translate it there are like

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,309
people from other all over the world

00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:59,830
here we and there are not a lot of

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:03,549
strings that can be translated in any

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:06,340
language right now if the app is

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:09,129
translating in 11 languages and if you

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,860
install it an operating system is in

00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:15,100
let's say in one of the languages that

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,710
is translated for example Chinese

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,850
traditional if that's your operating

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,149
system on Android you're going to get

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,789
the app translated on Chinese directly

00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:27,820
so it's in translated in 11 languages

00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:30,639
and 8 of them are partially translated

00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,149
from people we don't know we haven't met

00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:33,429
them

00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:37,539
never we haven't promoted the app much

00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:42,519
so we also have a section called citizen

00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:44,559
of the month which is some the smallest

00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:47,230
reward for people that do a lot of work

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,830
on their free time for the for the

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,389
project and some of the some of the

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:56,190
people are involved are our friends but

00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:59,289
there are also people we I got contacted

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,460
yesterday two days before from a girl in

00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,080
Kenya and she wanted to write

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,200
documentation for the application I have

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,600
never met her before so what are the

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,429
next steps of the app of the project

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:15,070
very important is to have offline usage

00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:16,419
for obvious reasons although in Europe

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,399
right now we have you don't have any

00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:21,669
roaming in the countries that are inside

00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,409
the user but it's it's for many reasons

00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:25,330
it's very nice to have often also for

00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:30,100
privacy reasons it's better to have an

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:32,919
offline version of the map right now and

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:37,019
this is between us we are not we are

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:37,019
just using directly the OpenStreetMap

00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:44,950
system but we are moving to to using map

00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:48,039
tiles quite in the next weeks or months

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:50,049
because this is the right thing to do

00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,999
and also this is the best thing if you

00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:55,080
want to be to scale the application

00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:55,080
community governance

00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,940
we need to do some basic rules with we

00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:03,529
have a code of conduct but this is not

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:05,480
always enough for the governments of

00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:08,509
project governance group project online

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,779
infra a mailing list it's gonna be set

00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:14,570
up and also the website it's nice but

00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:16,610
it's will be better and of course as I

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,899
mentioned before documentation it's very

00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:22,149
important for people that are new in the

00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:25,490
project but also for people that want to

00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:29,929
see what's happening in more details the

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:33,529
long term vision is to have to pay

00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:35,299
through the app we are now in exploring

00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:38,779
that and the better the best way

00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:41,539
anonymous way one of the ways not the

00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:43,399
best way is to use cryptocurrencies to

00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:47,720
pay through the app if you go if you

00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:49,759
check from small cities like there is a

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,570
small city in the Netherlands called

00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:56,870
diamond and there are almost 100 and

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:59,090
something 110 points of interest where

00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:02,179
people can pay by using cryptocurrencies

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,710
there so there are a lot of places where

00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,779
you can pay with cryptocurrencies and

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,330
also be kind of more safe when you're

00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:11,509
paying right now when you are traveling

00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,289
usually it's you there are three or four

00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:14,169
booking.com

00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:17,690
Airbnb there are only three or four

00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:19,850
services that have have like a monopoly

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,789
of this service and they know all your

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,350
data what on what you are doing and the

00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:27,889
last since I think we are in the end and

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,929
we don't have much time we want to

00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:32,419
introduce like a concept called liquid

00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:34,850
shareholding for giving back to people

00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:38,059
that have invested their time on the on

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,950
the project what does this mean if you

00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:41,929
are doing if you are improving the code

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,759
of the application if you are doing

00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:49,789
design if you are working on a community

00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:51,950
meetup in your own City and you

00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:55,429
documented all the steps through the

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:58,429
github repository or any repository

00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:03,950
the idea is to once we have launched the

00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:06,649
online payments to give back the to

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,370
anyone that has contributed the amount

00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:09,500
of

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,030
financial recognition based on the

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,300
contribution that they have done the

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:17,420
last amount of time six months so this

00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:20,120
means that even if myself that I started

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,120
up the project even if I didn't

00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,100
contribute for the last six months if I

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,130
have not contributed this means I will

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,800
not get compensated based on this system

00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:33,890
so we think that's the fair thing to do

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,559
it's kind of a I hate the word but it's

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:43,670
kind of a blockchain or on in terms of

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:47,200
rewards for the for the app so Philemon

00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:49,760
Derrick thank you and if you have any

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,360
questions I would be more than happy to

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,360
answer them

00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:57,130
[Applause]

00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:16,629
hello so I really like the privacy

00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:19,809
approach great but there are some useful

00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:23,200
features that come from tracking people

00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:26,799
and Google can ruin that so put it's a

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,409
pity that that for example you can't if

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,999
you compare for example citymapper they

00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:34,899
do a lot of stuff by tracking their

00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:37,899
users but they also they also do pretty

00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:40,659
useful features so how do you plan to

00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:43,269
address that or is there an idea about

00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:49,059
that to do it in a privacy sensitive way

00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:50,289
but still offer the same features in as

00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:52,529
I'm as I mentioned during the

00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:56,200
presentation once you are using Android

00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:57,549
a version of Android that is comes

00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,700
usually by default with your mobile

00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:02,769
device your location you don't know

00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,450
where your location information is going

00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:08,710
and probably that's going to Google

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:11,230
right so for that that's that's a

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,840
solution where you can install your own

00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:18,239
Android version but that's very

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:21,429
complicated for for daily users I think

00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:22,960
this is my personal approach to online

00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:25,299
privacy this is where I tell to people

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,980
on activities like the crypto party

00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:36,070
mentioned before is that you start going

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:38,379
off the grid gradually for example or

00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:41,679
was yeah but what I mean is for some

00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:47,739
features you have to track users Oh

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:50,139
for example for example if there is no

00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:52,629
data on train delays for example you can

00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:54,070
see who is on the train and so there are

00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:58,029
a lot of features like that other

00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:59,679
companies are doing it so yeah any

00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:04,989
thoughts on that I would be interested

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:07,899
to figure out the solution if you are on

00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:12,600
the train and you are giving yeah or for

00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:15,540
example you get information on

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,100
traffic delays or on other stuff and

00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,200
that's all because people are being

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,360
tracked or you get information on how

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,610
busy is a train and maybe you should

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,190
take the next one so there are features

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,410
like that that come from tracking people

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:31,530
that's in a very nice kitchen but it's

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:35,430
not on the on the pipeline for quite

00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:39,480
some time in the app but outside the app

00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:40,710
I think if it's about convenience if you

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,700
find that convenient

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,050
you're gonna give out your privacy so if

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,540
you do if you want to have your privacy

00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:50,850
it's just like locking the door if you

00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,700
want to be your home to be safe you need

00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,260
to have like 100 locks but if you want

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,630
to be convenient it'll just close the

00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:01,140
door and leave your house that's how I

00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:02,910
say in general so I don't know if I

00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:10,110
answered it's not it's not at the

00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:12,770
pipeline of the link as you go any other

00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,770
questions

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,500
