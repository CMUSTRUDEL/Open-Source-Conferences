OpenStreetMap started in the UK when a few people had some big aims. For the last year the UK has had an official local chapter of OSMF, and it had 4 specific aims. Have we achieved them, and where are we going from here?

hey so uh States of the UK it's kind of

00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,510
titled for subtitled 14 years of vision

00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:18,369
I kind of wanted to do this as a

00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:22,240
one-year report but also a 14 year

00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:25,270
report so OpenStreetMap started in my

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:30,010
country 14 years ago you may remember

00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:33,850
that this is a map so up this little

00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:37,149
green blob is is Manchester that's where

00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:40,510
Steve Case started mapping and he did

00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:42,280
some stuff in London this the green

00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,289
blobs aren't real data but I wanted to

00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,949
show these are kind of the areas of

00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:50,530
activity we've had it kind of had a lot

00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:53,739
of people in in cities like London and

00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:56,050
Birmingham and Edinburgh on this in

00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:59,489
Scotland a lot of people on the south

00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,989
coast that's where the Ordnance Survey

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:05,470
headquarters are and there are national

00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:07,630
mapping agency that we kind of opens

00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,210
heat map started a bit as a competitor

00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,420
against them because they had no open

00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:16,800
data so so there were lots of people

00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:20,430
mapping and we've done lots of the map

00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,620
and the the OpenStreetMap foundation

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,450
that you hopefully heard about is a UK

00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:32,290
company and it started in the UK as well

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,420
but OpenStreetMap the foundation is had

00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,360
a worldwide vision there's other

00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,850
organisations like Cott that are very

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,890
focused on talking about OpenStreetMap

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:47,890
and helping people worldwide so local

00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:50,470
chapters are really important and some

00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,690
people think did the the UK surely

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,300
you've got the foundation already but we

00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,880
needed to start this chapter so last

00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,040
year this is us or some of us at stake

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,310
to the map with the foundation directors

00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:07,750
and we signed off as a official local

00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:10,000
chapter of the foundation and I think

00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,180
they're really important to have all

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,550
around the world to actually understand

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,580
their country individually and

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:21,610
and do work there so I'll talk quickly

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,190
on on what we've been doing we've we've

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,940
got four frames that you'll be able to

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,680
see see on our website later but I think

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,430
they're really exciting because they're

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,470
talking about improving OpenStreetMap

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,570
they're not it's not quite the same as a

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,930
foundation that's protecting and running

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:43,120
the servers we're talking about we we're

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:48,790
more focused on improving the community

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,920
but also actively promoting data being

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:55,030
released and promoting how it's being

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:58,870
used and and and that's a lot easier to

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,730
do on a national scale so we built one

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,590
of the things we've done in the year is

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,930
kind of I want to say built a fresh

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,600
community this may be controversial

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:11,410
because as I said there's lots of people

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,980
and some of the first mappers were from

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:18,100
the UK and still mapping there but we

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,440
hadn't done a lot as as a country for a

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,800
while so we kind of had to rebuild this

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,140
community because it's no good kind of

00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,330
saying oh we'll come to state of the map

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,270
because people don't want to always

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,900
travel to another country so we built up

00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:37,120
we've got some members now it's it's

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,520
nearing a hundred members we've got a

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,410
newsletter that's just making really

00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,959
clean it's a bit tidier than the mailing

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,959
lists and it's it's clean updates on

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:50,040
what's happening and interesting stories

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:53,640
and event we hosted one event in

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,840
Manchester which as I said obviously

00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,510
partially started there but there aren't

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,910
many active mappers and I'm not sure

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,400
anyone from Manchester who lives in

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,550
Manchester now is at this conference so

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,950
we had an event there and we we make new

00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:12,430
friends and new mappers and told them

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:16,450
about OpenStreetMap and where we're

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,820
engaging people in new ways and we've

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,450
been equipping the community tooling

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,270
them up

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:25,570
oh I've got no time so one of the great

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:28,760
things is we bought a 360 degree camera

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,940
for open street cam and map Hilary you

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:35,900
rent that out and and then it gets

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,370
shared around and the the us group perv

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,850
act you've been inspired by that and

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:45,800
bought some dash cameras to share around

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,930
we promoted OpenStreetMap we've got lots

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,740
of case studies we've written and we're

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:54,050
still writing there's a Welsh map when

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,510
Google changed their license fees we

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,820
said hey we did a blog post and said you

00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,040
can switch to OpenStreetMap and we

00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,840
helped people say why you know it's not

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,140
just about costs there's good benefits

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,810
and we pointed them to two ways they can

00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:13,310
switch their website or their business

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:16,490
to open treat map and we're widening the

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:19,120
community with other organizations like

00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,680
the open data Institute and cordon

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,490
corporate members we need to do more of

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,040
that we can talk with companies that

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,910
have data that maybe aren't so good at

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,800
talking with communities and

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,500
particularly the Ordnance Survey and the

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,130
geospatial Commission that's about open

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,560
data now yes so we wouldn't have been

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:46,370
able to talk to them without this this

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,310
chapter and saying this is where I want

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,290
to go this the website osm UK talk where

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,200
you can see lots more cuz I can't talk

00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,940
about it all also on the local chapters

00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,850
table out through that door in the

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:03,260
corner I put a book out there so come

00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:08,060
and find it or find me and I'll tell you

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:11,990
more about what we're doing I could have

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,600
talked pasta also tomorrow in the

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:19,250
morning there will be a session with the

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,780
OpenStreetMap chapters we all open Sigma

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,010
chapter so if you are interested in

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,010
