hello guys hope you have a good session

00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:18,970
of lunch I guess in our country after

00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,690
having lunch we have a tendency to feel

00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,130
sleepy

00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:26,950
we call it bathroom hope it's not

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:31,500
impacting you guys over here as you're

00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:36,460
not having rice in the lunch I guess

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:40,030
however I'm the south ibaka villa mostly

00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:44,499
known as ribbon i depth the south or

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:48,789
ribbon anything you can choose I'm from

00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:55,300
Bangladesh presenting OS on Bangladesh

00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:57,940
community over here we I have been

00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:02,609
working with OpenStreetMap Bangladesh

00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:08,560
community for a while now for I guess

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:13,770
three or four years so in this period of

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,630
time I have been able to see my

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,510
community grown up as one of the most

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:25,420
vibrant community in the global arena of

00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:28,960
osm I have met a lot of great people

00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:31,840
like you guys over there also some

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,910
people who have been contributing in the

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:43,240
OSM arena for a lot of time I will be

00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:45,460
mostly presenting today about what the

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,750
community over here in Bangladesh is

00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:54,310
doing for last one year or so probably

00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:58,630
you guys have if you guys have gone

00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:01,659
through the databases of osm in

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,920
Bangladesh arena you you have been

00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:09,700
seeing a lot of things going on a lot of

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,319
projects are booming over there and a

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:16,670
lot of people involving at the

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:21,290
time though in Bangladesh OpenStreetMap

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:26,120
has been introduced in back in 2011 with

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:29,209
the balance University of engineering

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:34,099
technology students involved in it and

00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:37,280
afterwards we have seen some eight

00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:41,299
agencies and donor groups like World

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,989
Bank Red Cross and other major aid

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:51,199
agencies helping the growth of OSM in

00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:55,030
Bangladesh during the time we have a I

00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:57,169
would say a boom in OpenStreetMap

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:01,400
volunteerism and enthusiasm in

00:02:57,169 --> 00:03:04,519
Bangladesh during the time back in 2015

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,109
where when missing maps piloted a

00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,219
project over there

00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:13,430
I say Eureka is a yogi and pitmasters

00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:16,519
was there and that time we have seen a

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,280
lot of educational institutes and other

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:24,009
people getting involved with the

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:29,120
community and doing a lot in the making

00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:35,139
but I will rather focus on last one

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:37,540
years or some activities in Bangladesh I

00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:41,269
would say it was an impressive

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:47,930
activities going on over there during

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:52,159
the period in early 2007 17 I would say

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:55,759
a group of active volunteers what

00:03:52,159 --> 00:04:00,250
happened we have seen a group of active

00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:03,169
volunteers thinking about something like

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:07,099
bringing on the change what's happening

00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:11,479
out there with osm in Bangladesh and in

00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:14,000
the subcontinent arena also we were

00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:18,829
lacking structured community

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,250
coordination I would say and as you all

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,730
know osm is a diverse community people

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,030
from diverse background coming

00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:31,560
into it and blending up for a common

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:37,830
cause but what we have seen that because

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:41,010
of lacking of proper coordination the

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:45,630
guys over there who are getting involved

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:48,450
as volunteers didn't sustain we have

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,550
seen a lot of new people getting engaged

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,590
with every projects and every

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:58,260
initiatives not having the old people

00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,720
contributing content continuously

00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,900
contributing we were lacking the cost

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,940
insisted consistency over there so to

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:11,850
have that consistency we thought about

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:15,900
something to build up a coordination for

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:18,750
the community and the mechanism will

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,660
bring out the best from the diverse

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:26,730
community we have over there and at the

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:29,910
same time we will support in a way more

00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:32,040
organized way and collaborate with the

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,070
other organizations humanitarian

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:38,070
OpenStreetMap has team has been working

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:41,870
a lot in those region with the aid

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:46,290
agencies and other agencies over there

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:48,960
also we have seen blood of or commercial

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:52,890
organizations are also trying to put

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:56,220
their efforts with osm over there so we

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:58,890
try to bring all those things together

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,170
in a single platform generally to the

00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:05,060
single platform where community can

00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:09,780
involve in a big way and it might

00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:14,760
sustain the community environment in a

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:19,700
bigger picture so we we were planning

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:23,810
out something and then we came up with

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,940
something out of it that we were calling

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:30,810
booth Bangladesh humanitarian

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:34,500
OpenStreetMap operational team booth

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:39,540
over there booth in Bengali booth

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:45,120
presents the ghosts we thought we will

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:49,770
be the ghosts of the OSM over there you

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,700
cannot see it over there you can see the

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:56,070
presence of some sort of entity is there

00:06:52,700 --> 00:07:00,080
but you can feel it when you see

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:04,890
something is happening this was the main

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:08,220
I would say the main thoughts behind the

00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:11,669
naming also we came up with the name and

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,910
from that period of time this was an

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:17,850
unofficial entity and that period of

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,650
time when we thought that we will be the

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,980
background people we will not be the

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:28,169
poster boys of the community we will not

00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:31,650
focus on just bringing our faces up to

00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:34,320
the cameras and showing ourselves up

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:40,530
whenever any events or something is

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:45,120
happening out there so the guys over

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:51,229
there decided to work better in a way

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:56,040
and at the very initial stage they have

00:07:51,229 --> 00:08:01,050
somewhat been able to communicate and

00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:03,840
collaborate with one of the largest and

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:11,240
fastest growing startups in Bangladesh

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:15,150
that's we call it but how that is major

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:22,350
ride-hailing company over there that has

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:25,070
been started up back in 2016 so that

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:27,990
time they wanted to work with

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:34,349
OpenStreetMap with router navigation

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:40,219
stuffs so there's the main theme for

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:42,870
their works we're moving Bangladesh so

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,940
that was not only a right sharing

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,750
company they also have deliveries and

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,540
food delivery things coming up

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,210
their project and the whole project

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,070
needs needed route and navigation

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:58,540
services proper routing navigation

00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:02,530
services and in OS and when we have been

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:07,780
able to communicate and sort of advocate

00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:10,930
osm to the part of the governing body of

00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:17,200
the company and then they decided to

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:20,140
support OS 'm in a way to sustain bring

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,620
sustainability in the community the

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:29,530
cause we are thinking about and moving

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:34,150
forward with that part and within this

00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:36,490
period or we've given the chance last in

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:40,510
the last session panel discussion I was

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:45,900
talking about how sustainability can be

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:48,370
achieved with different part of the

00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,830
different types of organizations getting

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,260
involved in it not only that aid agency

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:55,320
not only the government bodies but also

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,970
the commercial entities should be

00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,300
engaged in the total process because

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:04,450
this brings some sort of opportunity for

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:08,290
the student base who are the main

00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:12,150
volunteers or the main powers of the OSM

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:18,610
community almost throughout the world so

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:20,800
to bring on that we started to build up

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,920
the community being on the community

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:28,330
people to a single platform as we are

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:31,510
talking about the boots we started

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:36,070
working on in a moto to initially to

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:39,370
have Dhaka City been back mapped in a

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:43,450
proper way with the highways and all the

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,930
features within itself but afterwards we

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:50,730
focused on that all the

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:54,020
major cities of the country and we're

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,339
part how decided to operated opera

00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,589
continue their operations on Ducati

00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:02,420
tagong select and some other part of the

00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:09,810
country in that region in those regions

00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:12,990
we have been able to trace up almost 1.6

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:15,960
million buildings and more than 10,000

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,630
kilometers of roads from the satellite

00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,200
imagery and afterwards we build up a

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:26,010
film mapping team over there who

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,779
collected almost 130,000 POS and

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:32,730
building level information from the road

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:36,270
and almost 300,000 street level images

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:41,100
from the streets and all those things

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:43,410
will go to OpenStreetMap after going

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,550
through the QCs and other processes so

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:52,380
this has been done within a year last

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:54,930
from last June to now and why we are

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,390
considering to put it in the

00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:00,500
OpenStreetMap so that other companies

00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:04,589
other users who has been working with

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:07,350
some sort of navigation and other things

00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:11,130
will be interested to work with

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:13,890
OpenStreetMap more and we have that

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,380
result more and more companies were

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:20,850
interested and showing their interest to

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:25,140
work with us over there and build up

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:27,300
teams for themselves to how to use those

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:32,190
datasets that has been developed over

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:34,770
there at that time as but how has given

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:39,350
us the opportunity to build up the team

00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:42,890
and not sure the community over there we

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:46,290
started a project named map your city

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:52,830
during this period of time map your city

00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:55,290
was initially formed to with a motor to

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,480
map up all the major cities in the

00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:00,079
country

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,329
and engage all the volunteers in in the

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,950
city level in every each and every city

00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:10,970
so we had total 18 tasks created over

00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:13,820
there in 18 cities city areas and we

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,070
have trains down 2.9 million buildings

00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,779
sixty three point two kilometres of

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:23,660
roads and more than 10,000 waterways in

00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:27,769
the process and that covers up almost

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:30,260
more than 10,000 square kilometers of

00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:32,839
area covered within this period of time

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:39,800
that's one year time I am talking about

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:44,680
and with that project we also work with

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:48,589
other some other projects that has been

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:51,079
implemented afterwards in the period of

00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:56,540
time I'm just showing you some stats it

00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:59,600
might be simmering a bit but just before

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:03,079
we have initiated this particular

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,660
initiatives that total numbers of

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:09,019
buildings you can see how how much

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,449
buildings have been drawn this period of

00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:14,990
time within Bangladesh - five more than

00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:21,440
five million buildings hundreds more

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:24,410
than 100,000 highways and almost 22,000

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,310
waterways what happened out there this

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:31,579
mammoth amount of tasks have before May

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:35,240
2017 it banished data set was only 22

00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:39,470
megabytes when now if T's turned into

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,959
160 megabyte it has been a huge amount

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:45,670
of tasks what have been done over there

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:50,120
who are being working with that data

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:53,660
part of the OpenStreetMap you might have

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:58,160
known there how how hard it is to reach

00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:01,190
this pile of just bring this pile of

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,920
data over there so this was the

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:07,459
historical data section you can see in

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,560
the seven years last seven years we were

00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:15,709
managed to add

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:20,660
only that is 540 thousand buildings over

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:25,759
there where it raised almost 10 times in

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:29,059
a year so all these things are making

00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,879
the difference why I am showing this up

00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:35,059
that this might be an opportunity for

00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:39,920
the other communities throughout the

00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:43,069
globe who are being just victim of not

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,769
being able to sustain the volunteers

00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:52,279
over there they can also try out these

00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:55,129
things I guess with the things there has

00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:57,790
been other projects there that has been

00:15:55,129 --> 00:16:01,540
coordinated throughout this time period

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:04,490
last year we have a major floods

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,639
affecting the whole south this South

00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:11,259
Asia and Bangladesh is one of one of the

00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:14,569
country who what has been impacted much

00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:16,329
hot humilated OpenStreetMap team

00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:20,420
straightaway activate declared

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:24,139
activation over there and that time 25

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,970
tasks handled by good that covers up 1.2

00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:27,949
million buildings and forty four

00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,980
thousand kilometres of highways and

00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:36,110
covered 15,000 125 square kilometres of

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:38,569
areas same time we have more and more

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,449
other projects being implemented over

00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:44,269
there there is some statistics out there

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:46,970
map it map your city is a project that I

00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:50,420
have been talked about South Asian flood

00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:55,279
and at the same time last year wearing a

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:58,300
refugee crisis where when came up we

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:02,420
helped them out and that period of time

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:05,360
there are some major amount of buildings

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,490
and roads are there at this same period

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,220
of time we have been working with

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:13,880
balanced Water Development Board to help

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:17,030
them out with improving the coastal

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,260
communities and colder areas over there

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,980
I guess one of one of the projects was

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,880
with

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:29,179
a research project of Oxford University

00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,710
backed by World Bank and afterwards it

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:37,490
became Bangladesh Water Development

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:41,360
board's own project and a couple of

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:44,299
hours back Godwin and evangelist are

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,090
here Warwick University has been working

00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:48,710
with the project in the slum improving

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:53,059
the health facilities in the slum areas

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:55,880
we have helped them out with some works

00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:59,360
over there too so all these projects

00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,340
being implemented and at the same time

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,059
what we have done we have created our

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:08,150
own projects we didn't really rely on

00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:11,030
aid agencies or other organisations just

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:13,820
jumping in with the projects and giving

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,950
us some sort of work to do rather we

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:21,110
have we are constantly creating some

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:26,320
projects where we are thinking of being

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:28,400
the into the community guys who are

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,270
encouraged were being encouraged to

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,970
engage with some stuffs over there so we

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:38,270
are constantly working on creating

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:41,360
different projects for ourselves so one

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:43,850
of the thing we will be doing in next

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,860
year and continuing with that that's map

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,490
your city project that's we are being

00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:52,040
working out with one of the project we

00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,380
are thinking already what prototype

00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,870
designed clean City and Smart City

00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,750
project to have more environmental

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:03,140
cleanliness bringing onto the city areas

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:08,510
in our countries and another project

00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:11,929
where we have already pushed it to MI

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:14,270
dissolve challenge that's project

00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:18,770
lighthouse so mapping the coastal areas

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:21,860
and having a application being developed

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:24,710
as reporting mechanism for the coastal

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,770
areas of the country so that in term

00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:32,400
times of disasters and

00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:35,610
other other hazards people community

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,030
people can engage with reporting through

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:44,810
the maps and all these projects are

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:49,440
based on OpenStreetMap so what happened

00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:52,710
as we are we are thinking about more and

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,110
more projects and innovations going on

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:59,280
to engage and encourage people to get

00:19:55,110 --> 00:20:03,600
engaged with the community we are seeing

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,120
this as our challenge because we need

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:10,650
more and more external ideas coming in

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:13,980
to give us some sort of ideas how we can

00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:17,430
work forward as we are part of the

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:20,700
global community over here we always

00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:25,430
think as I was also mentioning in the

00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:32,580
other panel discussion too we need to

00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:36,360
transform into we rather than I why we

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:39,240
need to be we because if we think about

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:43,470
ourselves as a global community we

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:47,520
should get ourselves bringing on ideas

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,710
how to help ourselves out so we need

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,360
those external ideas coming in with the

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:59,790
internal ideas blending and all those

00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:02,340
efforts our efforts are going in to make

00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,710
the rnd cost-effective and minimize the

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,650
innovation risk over there and all goes

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,830
to the existing we have to find out the

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:15,090
new marketplaces where we can push those

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:16,710
things up our ideas and things to bring

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:21,210
on some sort of sustainability to the

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:25,620
community itself that was the thing I

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:29,040
was really wanting to discuss and share

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,890
the ideas to you guys always welcome

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:35,550
your ideas any sort of ideas you can you

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:41,159
can contact with us get along with us to

00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:44,249
give us the idea and overall

00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:46,799
you guys to give me a chance to talk

00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:50,460
about those all those things about what

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,289
we are talking about overall from osm

00:21:50,460 --> 00:22:05,779
Bangladesh Foundation and also from the

00:21:52,289 --> 00:22:10,369
boil team over over here thank you okay

00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:10,369
question time does anyone have questions

00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:19,049
impressive numbers so can you elaborate

00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:22,830
more on how this delivery company help

00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:26,479
you actually how does that translate

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:31,549
into adding the buildings and the roads

00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:36,359
into the mapping what happened out there

00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:39,499
as I mentioned that the company asked

00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:42,809
from us how they can integrate

00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:44,999
OpenStreetMap to their navigation and

00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:49,529
routing at the same time what they

00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:53,059
offers us that we can work on osm

00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:55,859
developing or some development and

00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:59,039
creating the base map for the country

00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:01,229
and also not sharing the community over

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,349
there they have given us the facility

00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:08,149
where we can use their internet

00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:11,309
facilities and some device stuffs also

00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:14,129
that was one thing that community was

00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:15,809
deprived of and feeling that they are

00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:19,649
not being able to contribute that much

00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:22,229
in a way in the process as I was

00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:25,019
mentioning most of the cases whenever a

00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:27,269
organization is working with the

00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:29,820
communities they focus on their own

00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:31,169
projects not on the overall development

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,489
of the OpenStreetMap

00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:38,070
thing in the region or in the country

00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:40,559
where this particular group has helped

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:44,609
us with they given us the freedom that

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:47,340
you can do anything to improve osm over

00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:49,830
there only thing we are asking from you

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:53,030
that you help us out with the router

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:57,350
navigation thing how we can

00:23:53,030 --> 00:24:00,380
being more better customer experience to

00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,360
the consumer we are working with that

00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:05,830
was the thing and a quick question so

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:09,580
are they using routing based on osm

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:15,530
routes based on osm not right now

00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:18,080
they're figuring out the routing routing

00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:21,920
mechanism over there they are thinking

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,400
about using OS RM on their back end

00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:35,990
routing system that's why they need the

00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:39,340
proper data over there no more question

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,340
thank you thank you

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,670
