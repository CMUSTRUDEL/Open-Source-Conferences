	00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:10,759
hello I wanted to present something very

00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:13,099
short which I've been working on for the

00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,950
last couple of months

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,420
I'm building a platform it's it's also

00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:21,590
my company and I'm building a platform

00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:27,020
on top of OpenStreetMap in which people

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:30,220
can get paid to propose and to submit to

00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:34,940
OpenStreetMap or to review OpenStreetMap

00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:38,360
edits the the project is called place

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:42,980
bazaar it's a place where people can buy

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:48,290
and sell OpenStreetMap data basically I

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:51,980
want to pay contributors to verify and

00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:54,440
maintain the OpenStreetMap data I want

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,170
to connect parties who have requests for

00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:02,420
data so people who for example want a

00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:04,640
camp site database to be full and to

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,630
have all the campsites on there they can

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,979
pay a euro for example for everyone who

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,870
adds a new campsite and last but most

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:16,820
importantly I want to make the

00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:20,930
OpenStreetMap data and censurable

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:23,060
so that if a central authority the

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,159
OpenStreetMap organization or a

00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,200
government decides that the

00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,670
OpenStreetMap should be blocked that

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,950
that becomes impossible very short about

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,900
blockchain for those who don't know

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,000
exactly what it is I'm not going to

00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,299
explain how it works but basically it

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,979
has three very important features which

00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:46,729
help me in this

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:49,040
no one is the owner its peer-to-peer so

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:52,990
it's between people there is no central

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,030
authority and that makes it unsensible

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,640
I'm building the platform the

00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:02,060
marketplace in so-called smart contracts

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,829
so there again there is no central

00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,570
authority that's routing the money and

00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:07,970
that's going to say no you cannot get

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,729
the money it's all between the person

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:13,819
who wants to pay for an edit and all and

00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,349
the person who does the edit it's

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,069
between them and that's the contract

00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,599
that if it's

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:24,310
Cote and it runs in the blockchain so

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:27,829
it's unsensible I hope to intensive

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:30,620
incentivize people but also companies to

00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:31,579
open up their data so in that way make

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,939
some money out of it

00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:38,930
I want to incentivize new contributors

00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:40,549
or existing contributors to start

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,919
mapping or to help or to continue

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:46,579
mapping and I want to incentivize

00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:53,269
reviewers to check whether some edit is

00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:55,280
actually going well also important is

00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:58,459
that someone can request extra

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,439
verification so for example if someone

00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:03,260
says that a hotel is on the corner of

00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,790
the street someone can request that

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,590
other people go and actually check

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,310
whether that hotel is there and then add

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,959
proof and so that the fact that a hotel

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,870
is on the corner of the street becomes

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:19,870
more and more sari becomes more and more

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:26,659
known and more and more verified and

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:28,790
then those verifiers have to be paid I'm

00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:30,889
not going to explain how I do this all

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,780
if you want to know more about it just

00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:34,729
hook me up tap me on the shoulder and

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,799
ask me and I can explain it in a lot of

00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:43,340
detail during one of the social talks or

00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:47,120
during one of the breaks for me I have a

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,060
couple of challenges that I need to to

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,689
work on in order to make the data

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,280
unsensible the planet PD PDF file or

00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:58,040
anything has to be sliced into much

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,349
smaller parts in order to be able to

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,280
store that on a blockchain

00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:07,489
I'm releasing it on ipfs if anyone has

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:12,199
any ideas on how to slice and dice the

00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:14,329
database please tell me and another

00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:17,299
thing that I'm working on right now with

00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:19,340
how to pay always I'm contributors that

00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:22,130
have been contributing in the past to

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,529
have paid them in retrospect and the

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:27,620
last thing if anyone knows about any

00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:30,699
similar projects any similar things also

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,699
please let me know

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,560
you can send me an email if you want

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,180
I'll be releasing the white paper which

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,190
is basically the explanation of the

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,420
whole platform some with this summer

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,220
yeah you can send me an email if you

00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,770
want to know anything or just want to

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:54,620
tell me that what I'm doing is really

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:58,230
stupid okay

00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,230
