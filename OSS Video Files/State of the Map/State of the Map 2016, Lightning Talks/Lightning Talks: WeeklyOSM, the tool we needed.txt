technical issues sir Manfred will update

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:13,830
us on his work in the next lightning

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:16,650
talk and applause please well let's say

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,990
I would like to show you today not what

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,080
I would show yesterday because yesterday

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,850
we had in mind to talk 20 minutes it's

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,590
only five minutes and now the idea is to

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:33,960
show you our tool which we need for

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:37,530
example we produce our weekly osm every

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,469
week in six language at the moment and

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,860
the time when Mark galing who is sitting

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,840
there on the steps founded the bottom

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,829
the German water no deeds it was very

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,190
easy to do that we collected then use we

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,590
collected the news in first in google

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,149
wave then in rizoma and then we wrote

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,859
our mark down and it was easy to produce

00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:07,860
HTML and publish it on a wordpress site

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:12,780
so it was no problem at all but in 2014

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:16,380
we started this translations to other

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:21,710
languages today we produce the weekly

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:30,090
osm every week 52 weeks a year in

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:34,560
English German Spanish um sorry check

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:37,170
Russian and Japanese so it was not

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,979
feasible to do that as we did it before

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,380
so the idea was that we really need a

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,670
tool who give us support to do that and

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,189
this is the tool which one of our guys

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,340
from the German community the hits name

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,979
is the five created for us the problem

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,040
was before we had to translate from

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,869
German to English and then we had to and

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,430
then we had the possibility to translate

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:07,170
it from English to the other languages

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:09,119
because it's not you cannot find people

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,739
in Japan who speak German and can

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,090
translate and so on and so on so the

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,840
common language

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:20,220
should would be English and now this

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,769
tool that we have is give give us this

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,470
possibility that we are collecting you

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:28,650
see that on the top we are collecting in

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:32,099
I said yesterday in 35 mailing lists we

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:36,150
are scanning the mailing list and the

00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:41,640
forums and so we collect the news in

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:46,319
this in this tool and then you can see

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,810
down you can see we write or in German

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,290
or in English or in any other language

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,880
and so the languages are absolutely

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,560
equal there is no leading language

00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,900
anymore so and the review process is the

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,030
same and you can translate from any

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,190
language to the other so it's no problem

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:09,239
at all that for example the Spanish

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,579
version appears as it happened two weeks

00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,489
ago before the German version was ready

00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:17,489
so it all depends from the from the

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:23,329
teams how are they working how how quick

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:28,440
they are doing the review and so on so

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:30,989
the tool is called osm bcbc for block

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,900
collector and it is I say it is a

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,700
content management system a system the

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,730
hundred management system was built

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,130
exactly for our needs we told the five

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:45,900
what we need how to do it and he wrote

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:49,290
it for us and it is a editorial to it

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,510
allows us to collect internet references

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,319
we ever set we collect in mailing list

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,359
sweeter and so on we are editing them in

00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,180
multiple languages we write in markdown

00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:02,880
and the markdown is converted from the

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:07,380
system to HTML so that it can be

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,760
exported directly to our WordPress we

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,889
have the possibility to discuss about

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,720
about certain articles we are writing do

00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:19,079
you think it's relevant or not do you

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,380
think as I wrote it it's correct or not

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,320
do you think it is political correct or

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,650
not so these are the discussions

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,550
we have in the team and this happens in

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:37,370
this in this osm block collector and we

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:40,760
are so collecting topics it supports the

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:46,040
placate research if you if you collect

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:48,410
and a URL and another another guy had

00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,000
collected it before so the system

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:56,900
recognize it and said be careful there's

00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:03,890
dublicate it expands Twitter URL and so

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:12,710
on and so on what's my time one minute

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:19,160
okay one minute here you can see more or

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:22,190
less the how it looks like in on the top

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:27,250
you you have the collect button you

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:33,140
collect you put in the URL it says you

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:38,360
it gives you just thank you it gives you

00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:42,590
it gives you a just it takes the title

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,990
from the from the URL from the from the

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:50,060
mailing list it puts directly that the

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:53,270
title into into our system and you say

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,580
it's okay and you can see on top you can

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,590
edit in several languages you can choose

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,440
the language you can switch the

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:05,810
languages it's no problem at all in all

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:08,120
these six until well at the moment ten

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,330
languages we can switch whenever you

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,330
want

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,870
here you have where is where is weakly

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,819
as I apparently produced the yellow ones

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:32,090
is Spanish team the English tea moderate

00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:36,599
buttons and well the time is nearly over

00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:38,940
where we are going with weekly osm as I

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:43,860
said yesterday we are really have in

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:47,009
mind to produce more in local languages

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:50,759
I think it's important even I read even

00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:53,009
when I wrote the English some articles

00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,780
in English and we have the native

00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,990
speaker in English who are correcting it

00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:02,610
even I read the whole the whole block in

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:06,080
German so I think we have this is

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:09,810
absolutely a very nice tool to spread

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,360
these articles to spread and I had a

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,639
talk with a guy from hot in the morning

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:20,969
he said maybe if I can use it as well

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:24,030
for they for their needs yesterday I

00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:28,370
said where we are going here we are

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:32,039
Laura from Cuba developed a weekly osm

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:35,639
mobile app she told yesterday why we

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,949
developed it here is the URL and until

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,539
now it's not only a weekly osm mobile
