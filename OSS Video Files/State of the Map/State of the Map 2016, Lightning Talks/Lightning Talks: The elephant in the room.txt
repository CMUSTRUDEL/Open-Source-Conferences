let's give word to our next speaker who

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:12,120
will talk to us about well he will

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:13,980
explain to yourself hi everyone I'm it

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,960
is very friend I'm going to talk about

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:21,510
well i work at maps near some of you

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,140
know the application it's basically an

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,090
offline map viewer we say everything

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,080
that offline maps should have like

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,300
geocoding and routing and all the stuff

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:38,100
yeah it's very good but now i'd like to

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,710
for you to look at this chart maps knee

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,629
is also NATO and later that works

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,850
offline that requires no prior knowledge

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:53,160
of taking systems of well josan and

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:57,000
stuff and since april it started to be

00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,510
quite popular last month it's almost

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,909
caught up with ID either by number of

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:09,420
users and it will well it will only get

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:14,430
more users and of course match meter is

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:17,430
responsible for four large of new active

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,189
members as you can see it's the graph is

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:26,580
just have started raising and it

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:29,460
continues and the thing is it's it may

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,729
seem like it's a huge increase but i'd

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,000
like you to know that we had 11 million

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:38,250
active users in last month and more than

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,700
50 million installations and we haven't

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,740
actually started properly marketing

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,210
aging feature so you can imagine when

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:53,130
what would happen when you start yeah

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:56,610
and also a quick look at diversity of

00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:01,009
haters these are current state states

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:04,130
about well who edits openstreetmap using

00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:09,569
common a status like Joseph and I gene

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:12,870
this is where many as receive and top 10

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,740
countries they have edited in just two

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,950
days ago

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,950
you can see iron Iraq repair my rates

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,610
Algeria and so on so it's a pretty

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,630
diverse so basically people from these

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,480
countries they don't know about

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,640
openstreetmap don't know how to open G

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,830
awesome and install it they just open

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:38,100
the application at the shops restaurants

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:41,790
and continue living the life right and

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:44,990
did quite a lot of edits and the

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:48,450
response from the community was mixed

00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:51,000
some my processor even claimed that

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,820
hundred percent of edits done with maps

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,900
me should be reverted something like

00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:00,530
that and I'd like to thank the medbox

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,990
data team that actually went and

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:07,500
performed an analysis of changes from

00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:10,200
meth users turned out just like the last

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,240
time it's around three percent for bait

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:18,960
AIDS which is of course also high but

00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:22,260
manageable and some of these due to bugs

00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,460
in editor some because people generally

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:31,920
like to well add some weird stuff on the

00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:38,000
map the response to that was also well

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:40,890
mixed and what does it show us first let

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,560
the community issues we have are no

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:48,650
specific to mailing lists this was diary

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:53,150
entry and I know something I think

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:58,400
should be done with it community wise so

00:03:53,150 --> 00:04:01,170
maybe we have to think about making less

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,490
toxic community or how it's called

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:08,820
nowadays I know some duration maybe

00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:12,060
whatever right math is not going

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:17,280
anywhere it's a I hope it won't be bench

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:20,520
and it will continue to grow and the

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,750
reason for this harsh replace is not

00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,810
that matters

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:28,390
the way there it's because some rappers

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,960
feel like values can't control over the

00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:33,940
map like they see a lot of edits and

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,490
they don't have proper tools to deal

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:40,180
with it and they're mostly right because

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:44,010
we don't have any tools to properly

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:48,790
watch the map because there were some

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:52,090
releases that challenged common world

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,790
words like monitoring the map isn't just

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:58,419
counting the number of objects that was

00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:00,700
made analyzing the map isn't just seeing

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:03,760
which buildings of joy it's actually

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,419
analyzing taking a plaint file its scene

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,950
which what was moved maybe

00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:11,740
cross-referencing to other data sets so

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:18,340
we need proper analyzers and we don't

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:21,610
have this and well in LA seeing when it

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,919
isn't just by editors is a common

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,860
mistake I made it a couple of years ago

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:31,030
with spotlight now I write the results

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,610
so yeah we should have tools a better

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:36,220
tools so for finding vandalisms and

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:41,160
that's what I want you to do to think

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:47,350
about how can we actually monitor

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:49,570
analyze edits how to how can we find bed

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,880
edits and separate them from good ones

00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:54,460
how to properly revert them and

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,919
generally how to know that the map in

00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,770
your region is actually good and we

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:04,690
cannot do it but it's so the thing that

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:06,790
still needs to be done yeah and thanks

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,979
and I'd like to if you have questions

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,050
I'd like to invite you to our booth and

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:15,180
maybe if you want some have some

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,180
checkers yeah

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,590
um hi I'm Janet I just like to say that

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,430
that I find we're using maps taught me

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,870
to map very poorly mapped areas of rural

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,320
tanzania it's been absolutely brilliant

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,060
for that and so I just like to say that

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,430
I mean although I can see that there are

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,139
some issues please don't forget those

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,639
areas of the world that are read badly

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,169
mapped and tools like this are

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,810
absolutely fantastic for them and

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,280
there's a workshop tomorrow at eleven

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,620
forty-five to try and look at some of

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,770
these issues so please come along to

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,770
