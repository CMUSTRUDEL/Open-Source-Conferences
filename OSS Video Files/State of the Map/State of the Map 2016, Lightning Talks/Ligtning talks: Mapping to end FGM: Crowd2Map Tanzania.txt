Crowd2Map Tanzania is helping to put rural Tanzania on the map, focusing on the region of Mara where female genital mutilation (FGM) is widespread. By mapping they lay the ground for the essential outreach work carried out by the Mugumu Safe House program in the neighbouring villages. Janet explains how and describes why this work is so crucial.
