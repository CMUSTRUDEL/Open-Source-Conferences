Crowd2Map Tanzania is helping to put rural Tanzania on the map, focusing on the region of Mara where female genital mutilation (FGM) is widespread. By mapping they lay the ground for the essential outreach work carried out by the Mugumu Safe House program in the neighbouring villages. Janet explains how and describes why this work is so crucial.

good afternoon everybody my name is

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,580
janet chapman from i'm a volunteer at

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,250
tanzania Development Trust which is a

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,280
volunteer an organization that has been

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,060
supporting grassroots projects in rural

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,760
tanzania for over 40 years so the

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,410
projects that I I go to visit our in

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,560
villages that generally are not on the

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,599
map which is how i came to mapping

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,179
relatively recently though on the

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,910
picture here there is our biggest

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:37,170
project which is for girls refusing

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:40,140
female genital mutilation in magoo munir

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,780
serengeti and these are some of the

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,100
girls that have been assisting with this

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:51,090
mapping community mapping project so as

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:56,039
I said projects are in very poorly

00:00:51,090 --> 00:01:00,180
mapped villages maps don't exist even

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,329
with the local officials and it's very

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,409
difficult to even find your way around

00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:09,030
so as people know urban Tanzania look

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,680
particularly darussalam is very well

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,530
mapped particularly through our

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,040
colleagues Romani huriya that people

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,430
have heard a lot about this weekend week

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,860
even but the villages where I go to a

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,130
generally completely blank that so this

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,299
was a map of a village of 8,000 people

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,130
that I've visited very regularly so

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,799
we've been trying to get locals involved

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,320
in mapping their own communities if

00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:41,100
laptops exist on a open street map

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,759
directly but if not on using mobile

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,390
phones there was a missing Maps project

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,600
in this area in November last year so

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,630
thanks to people there actually put on

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,969
all the roads and residential areas of

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,369
this area of Tanzania but none of the

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,880
village name so although this village of

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,649
Zay Zay was now had the roads maps it

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,970
didn't have it didn't have a name so you

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:12,710
still couldn't find it so and this is a

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:14,780
row B who's an FGM survivor herself one

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,880
one of the things that she does is goes

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:22,520
out into the surrounding villages around

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:25,460
Magoo mu and to try and advocate against

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,200
FGM and to raise awareness of the safe

00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:33,230
house these villages are not on the map

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,130
so what what we've done as a project is

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:40,910
we've first of all try to import

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:45,440
manually import all of the data from

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:50,440
every school in tanzania by used mostly

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,820
by using UN volunteers so we put on

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,640
coordinates and people manually paste

00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,850
them into openstreetmap and so if they

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,790
could see a school and trace around it

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,490
so we've also now moved on to map stop

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,590
me and so volunteers on the ground and

00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,640
where they have access to smartphones

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:17,050
are using maps dot me to actually add

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:20,330
village names add churches etc and so

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,880
this is a map now of Zay Zay where

00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:25,310
locals have added things like churches

00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,780
and so on now we work map stop me

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,940
although I think it's brilliant and

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,340
people that we work with really really

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,980
like it there are some issues in that

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,740
it's not it's not really tailored for

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,100
rural rural Africa so we're working with

00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:44,660
map stop me to develop a a better more

00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:47,690
customized app initially in English but

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,570
hopefully in Swahili as well so we've

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:53,510
incentivized this by organising

00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,070
competition so this is it shows the

00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,520
edits that have been made within

00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:01,520
tanzania on map stop me and so we have

00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,950
regular competitions and people can win

00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,520
a very small amount of money IE about

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:11,720
thirty dollars if they come if they make

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,920
the most points we've also set up a

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,510
Facebook group so for example these

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,480
villages are still not named so well

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:25,220
they weren't so posted on questions and

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,800
people respond and now they're named

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,960
there's some issues with this because it

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,870
omap stop me you're using slightly old

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,870
data so that several people might have

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,840
the same point we've said that what's

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:42,230
that group so that we are communicating

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:45,110
directly and trying to promote mapping

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,540
and we've set up a task on the hospital

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,470
on the tasking manager this is that the

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,970
area around magoo mu and it's now about

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,590
seventy-three percent maps and we need

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,710
desperately to get it finished before

00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,620
the cutting season as cutting happens as

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,060
a seasonal thing in December so we

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,510
really need to get that finished before

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,130
then so that Robi can go out and knows

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,740
where all the religious are and can

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,140
reach them so any help with that

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,250
particularly around validation would be

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:18,020
amazing we had a mapping party in May

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,350
and these are some people the girls at

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:24,560
the safe house and roby herself mapping

00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:27,980
I've got time for the video but some of

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,410
the having the beginnings of a map has

00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,240
made a huge impact already it's allowed

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,730
Robi to find villages that she wasn't

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,520
aware of before and also the way of

00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,800
getting there the road system is is very

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,229
very poor particularly in the rainy

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,510
season and so it allows her to work out

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:47,360
how to get there and also how much fuel

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,919
she was she needs which is again an

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,620
issue for something running on a

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,810
shoestring but most importantly

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,000
long-term that having maps will

00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:59,540
hopefully allow girls to actually reach

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,350
the safe house on their own last cutting

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:08,210
season we had over 200 girls some of

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:11,030
them ran through the night barefoot this

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,979
is rather absolutely zero money I'm a

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,919
volunteer and I've got one other person

00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:17,390
helping me who's also a volunteer so any

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,729
help that people can give will be

00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,490
absolutely amazing one of the limiting

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:25,540
factors is having access to phones in

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:29,840
rural tanzania so if anyone's got any

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:31,700
even old smart phones Android that they

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,630
don't want we could make very very good

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,790
use of them we need validators if

00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,070
anyone's got any idea

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,960
is about funding the competition's we've

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,180
had so far as basically all come out of

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,760
my pocket so it would be great if

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,770
there's even tiny amounts of funding for

00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,830
that what we really want to do is to

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:53,080
build up a network of local mapping

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:57,840
advocates in the rural villages so that

00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:00,310
they can train other people but again

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,380
that we needs a small amount of money to

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,630
get that off the ground but mostly I

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:08,260
mean I'm as I said I'm totally new to

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:09,910
mapping purely because I can see the

00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,250
absolute need for it in places like

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,710
rural tanzania so I would really really

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,290
appreciate technical advice about how to

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,510
be doing it better so there is a

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,750
workshop on Sunday at eleven-forty-five

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:26,410
in d1 and I would really really welcome

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:29,430
anyone's input to help me do this better

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,430
thank you

00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,490
hi Annette how the girls will know where

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,290
to go if they don't have a smartphone if

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,590
they don't have the map to the safe

00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:08,100
houses how they know how to get there

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:10,950
and be safe thank you that's a great

00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,530
question what we want to do eventually

00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,470
is when we have better maps is actually

00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:19,710
print maps out so that will be in the

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,830
village offices there will be a map that

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:26,280
says the safe place in that area but

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:30,750
also where where the safe house in the

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,640
ghumu is as well so yes all the girls

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,800
having access to smartphones is an

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,220
extremely long way off so yes we were

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,900
looking at producing paper maps but we

00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,700
first we need to generate the map of the

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,720
area before we in a position to do that

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,720
