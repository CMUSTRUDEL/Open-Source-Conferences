thank you good morning I will present

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,960
you in about five minutes next five

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,639
minutes about open transport net and map

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,299
open transports necessary European

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,910
funded research projects that I am

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,330
leading now for more than two years and

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:25,830
we are using in this project of course

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:29,160
OpenStreetMap as the main main map for

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,669
all links with open data we we have in

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,309
our project so the project itself try to

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,520
combine open data in the transport and

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,430
mobility worlds make it accessible for

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,890
for people for developers we are

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,200
involved to make this data findable

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,270
searchable on the web as well we're

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,329
trying to combine they're also metadata

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,980
systems from the Geo world and the open

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,960
data world so we're trying there to

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,270
combine them we work in they're very

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,590
close together with the open geospatial

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,949
consortium and the World Wide Web

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:06,030
Consortium as well our consortium itself

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,880
exists from out of 15 partners all

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,890
around Europe and we have four pilot

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,890
cities we're especially working with

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,189
city of Antwerp here and in Belgium

00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:20,220
Birmingham liberabit region and Czech

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,049
Republic and the Paris region as well so

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,390
what we're trying to do is to combine

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,900
all this information make it available

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,790
and so on but one of the projects we've

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,759
we are particularly presenting here is

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,450
the open transport map which is of

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,720
course based on open on OS m and what

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,150
we're what we're trying to do as to

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,180
translate it to the inspire regulation

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,640
in Europe so inspire is a big regulatory

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,770
framework in Europe where we try to

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,920
combine for several datasets more than

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:56,759
40 datasets to integrate it to have one

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,990
data model which is a blur obliged by

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,090
the European Commission

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,570
so we translate their open Street web

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,729
and we are also dance of work to do some

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:10,470
road segmentation as well so that it's

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,629
also able to do work together with for

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,650
traffic modeling so what we are

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,650
basically doing

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,950
is building a kind of traffic model and

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:25,470
display this on an open street map based

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:27,810
map I will all let's say to all of you

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,390
come to our booth downstairs we can show

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,940
you more about how it really works and

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,610
the one example I will show here in just

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,409
one minute it's what we've done now from

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,260
the city of pills and in Czech Republic

00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:44,190
so we've made here different traffic

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,069
predictions the one of them below is the

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,160
normal situation you have with normal

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:52,890
traffic flow and the one in the left

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,209
left upper corner so what you see there

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:59,269
on the right line there you have it's

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,560
the situation when one bridge is closed

00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:02,609
so they will close the bridge in the

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,010
center and there you will see

00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:06,629
immediately how the traffic how it's

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,530
expected that the traffic will flow

00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:13,109
through the city of of Pilsen so it's

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:17,630
maybe a bit a bit another approach of

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:21,120
using Open Street Map and an open data

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:24,180
to find out and to give people an idea

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,419
on how traffic will flow what will be

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:32,099
consequences if some public roadworks

00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:32,910
are taking place so I invite you all to

00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,269
our boots

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,709
my name is leaving grass and I'm

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:40,950
responsible for this European project

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:46,549
but I can of course explain much more

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,549
about its other stands I thank you

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,819
I hope so

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,860
so where does all the information come

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,500
that feeds on the traffic patterns do

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,959
you have a sense of devices or where do

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,639
you get the information

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,880
well the data we typically use for

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,100
traffic modeling is in fact it's a lot

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,520
of sources we have counters on the

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,880
routes we have also demographic

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,280
information we have origin destination

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,520
metrics is where people live where they

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,580
going for work for and so on so we are

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,910
not using this kind of models live data

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:46,220
but we're using in reality a lot of

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:49,229
statistical data to to find out the

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:53,389
origin destination matrixes of people

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,389
during week during weekend and so on

00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,740
well this kind of data it depends so

00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:06,090
some of them are statistical data and

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,910
are open some of them are on this moment

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,860
not so you have there a mix of a lot of

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,289
sources of information so I can't say

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,479
that they are all open now on the other

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:18,479
hand what you also see with with this

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,729
kind of information is that it is also

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,199
very technical to build up this kind of

00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:28,949
models so all the work we've done on on

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,380
making the traffic flow system there of

00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:34,080
course we're using specific software

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:37,020
that is not available for an open source

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,060
we were till now I think I believe so

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,669
what we are actually doing is displaying

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:47,099
the results so there is not that much

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:50,310
demand on this moment for the raw data

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:53,849
let's say like it is in other for other

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:58,580
datasets we have more demand for for for

00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:58,580
the source data yeah okay thank you

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,870
okay let's take our speaker again thank

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,870
