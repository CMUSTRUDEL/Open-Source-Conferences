um hello everyone i'm dan from ram

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,530
source i'm studying creative technology

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:13,200
in holland and I once for a little while

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,450
ready to make one unified map of the

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,390
history of the world so basically that

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,960
would be osm but then with the time

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:27,300
dimension to it and with much many other

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:30,539
kinds of data actually and there are

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,610
already many projects like this and what

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,570
they most of them have in common except

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,930
for open history map is that they all

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,290
are very specific for a specific area or

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,370
specific era and open history map is

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,410
doing I think the global thing but they

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,930
I think they don't have much momentum at

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,579
the moment and I actually think if you

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,079
want to do this right you have to do

00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,660
this like like run it like startup and

00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:03,059
you have to create big momentum and you

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,700
have to go for serious partnerships with

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:09,210
museums cultural organizations and that

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,040
sort of stuff and to be able to collect

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,060
serious funding and to work on it full

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,850
time with a team of people and I Maria

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,479
realizing this is a great challenge and

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,509
I'm actually like thinking about it for

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,430
a while already and I'm now working on a

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,920
prototype and actually decided to

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,130
dedicate like next five years to this

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,250
project and to make this actually happen

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,070
and in February there will be a lunch of

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,049
the proof of concept and to make this

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,549
feasible to do it in this time frame it

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:46,140
is on a restricted area and this area is

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,270
actually the campus of the University of

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,610
Twente and this is a pretty interesting

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,579
area to work on because it changed a lot

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,140
for the last 50 to 100 years so I'm

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,350
going to make a prototype that works on

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:02,520
that area through time free love at

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,909
least last 50 years and I actually think

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,640
this in the future could be like and

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:11,970
graphical user and now a graphical

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,830
search engine because for now when you

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,650
sue

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,660
when you're searching for history things

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,550
you search with keywords and your end up

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,470
with texts and probably you keep idea

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,440
where maybe there is a small map or

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,880
there's some pictures or paintings but I

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,160
actually think it would be way more

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,160
logical to visualize history on a map

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,960
from the top and to see all the data on

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,180
that map if any of you are interested in

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,830
discussing this and actually how history

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,590
should be mapped and how that should

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,500
work please join me at birds of a

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:49,550
feather session today at 2pm actually

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,680
and if you want more information and see

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,350
progress and that sort of stuff you can

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,270
go to map of humanity org that's

00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,680
actually the name of the project and for

00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,750
our there's a website that just gives

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,280
you information and gives you the

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,709
opportunity to come in contact and that

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,930
sort of stuff and in February the first

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:09,010
working prototype will be shown there

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,010
thank you

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,650
my name is Michael I just want to say

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,080
that this is great I'm i did history

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,120
it's all burning in Paris cool and what

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,300
you do is that you're realizing the

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,280
dream of hundreds of historians yeah I

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,130
don't know if you're in contact with

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,200
some of them not eject your project and

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,700
can excite them a lot what's good what I

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:54,770
wanted to sing nice i'm really happy

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:57,110
that so i can extend on that actually a

00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,780
bit like one of the goals i think is

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,320
that it can actually help a lot with

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,910
interesting people into history that are

00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,190
not really excited by reading big walls

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,810
of text and that sort of stuff and i

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:13,370
think it could also play a role in

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:15,140
education and the way like things get a

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,870
context if you see them on a map instead

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,540
of just here a place name on the text

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,620
for example so that's and actually can

00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,620
also make

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,700
right

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,260
where's

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,410
so this is the website and so like this

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,040
is a small visualization of what what

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,410
might be seen on the campus area the red

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,960
circled area is the the campus area you

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,510
see many many changes like buildings

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,910
that appear and the sort of stuff so I

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,460
think it's a sighting location to work

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:11,130
on to show the proof of concept yeah if

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,720
anyone also talked about history and

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,720
