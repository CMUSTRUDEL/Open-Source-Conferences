Title: Lightning talks: Using the ImproveOSM JOSM plugin
Publication date: 2016-10-22

The ImproveOsm plugin is a powerful tool, giving the JOSM mapper access to a huge amount of missing data points in OSM based on Big Data analysis. In this lightning talk the plugin’s main developer Beata will show you how to use it effectively in your daily mapping. If you would like to know more about the way we analyze billions of GPS points to identify the missing roads, one-ways and turn restrictions, you should also go to our talk ‘Using Big Data To Help Us Improve The Map’.

okay hi everyone my name is better and

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,140
I'm from telenav Europe today I feel

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,090
shortly presented the improv sm plugin

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,900
I'm not sure does anyone know the

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,570
plug-in or use it before I have seen a

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,430
few hands ok so the improvised

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,070
unplugging is a plugging that highlights

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,779
re has burrowed one-way attributes and

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,810
turn restrictions are missing from the

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,550
map this is a plug-in of the unification

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,500
of the missing rods plug-in that was

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,119
launched last year in September the

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,550
traffic flow Direction plug-in that was

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,700
launched in october and it was launched

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,370
in december along with the tangi

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:46,309
striction layer now I will show you a

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:46,309
short demo of this plugin just a minute

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:53,820
ok so our clogging is available in those

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,820
awesome plugin store and you can find

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,680
under improvisation plugin if you want

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,699
to use only one of the layers you can

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,830
select from the preferences so we have

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:09,500
three layers the missing Rose layer is

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:12,090
illustrated by red dots then we have the

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,240
filters you can filter out based on the

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,549
status and the top of the tiles the next

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,580
layer is the turn instruction layer this

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,100
is illustrated by blue dots and can be

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,530
filtered out also by status and

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,479
confidence level and the last layer is

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,530
the traffic flow Direction layer that

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,979
shows always on the map so now it will

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,229
be an example of a missing road missing

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,280
roads are actually represented by small

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:44,520
tiles the test was computed for only

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,979
zoom level 18 and are represented with

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,170
different colors based on the type this

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,509
is an example from Italy we have found

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,670
out a lot of small roads that are

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,979
actually missing from the map when you

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,140
select an element you can see on the

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,719
right side the details in the

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,649
improvisation panel no it will be some

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,990
examples of turn restrictions we have

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,880
also a lot of turn restrictions that

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:13,290
need to be verified

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:18,690
and added to the map oh so in this case

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:21,780
you can see with green the from segments

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:24,360
and we thread the two segments and it

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,330
said that you cannot turn from the green

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,330
to the red we have also situation where

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,910
there are multiple turn restriction in

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,730
the same point in this case we do stay

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:40,170
on app on the panel and you can select

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,760
from the table which one of the turn

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,750
instruction you would like to visualize

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,740
and for the traffic flow Direction layer

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,930
we show segments that should be tagged

00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:56,010
as the wrong way in oil Sam and/or not

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:58,680
tagged on the improv SNL we have

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,810
available also filters the filters are

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,580
applied to the selected and active layer

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:09,630
and after you add the element to the map

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:13,380
it is advisable to mark as closed

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,810
because otherwise the other users that

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:20,010
are using also are plugging will not

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:26,660
know if this was already solved or not

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:30,300
and some of the features we are also

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:33,000
working currently on developing this

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,030
plugin and we would like to order to

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,959
selection by moss drag this way users

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,690
can with one click close all the tiles

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,760
for cases under user head headed to the

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,770
lesson map for the tourney sectional

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,450
layer we would like to implement some

00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,880
kind of one click turn restriction

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,720
editing and also we are working in

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,410
adding a new Java 8 features and another

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,840
announcement we also having tomorrow on

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:03,630
the day after tomorrow presentation

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,640
regarding over Street View and we have

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,930
also the boot and if you have time

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:12,770
please go to the boot this is odd if you

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,770
have any question

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,770
what is the source of the information

00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:32,770
provided by the plug-in is this coming

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,030
from your actual navigation systems that

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:43,000
have been driven are you getting them

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:46,060
from other clues so the main source is

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,840
coming from the scouser app and we also

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,840
have other sources

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,400
Thank You beata I just have a tiny

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,620
suggestion because I've actually used

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,740
the plug-in and one thing I've noticed

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,460
is that it statistics are a bit of you

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,980
you tend to say if there's to drive

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,660
thrus over a tonne and none of them have

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:22,240
gone in the other direction you already

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:24,520
classify that as highly a high

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,560
probability for error but naturally at

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,260
the count of two could just be

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,900
coincidence so I think you should take

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,340
actually the number of data points you

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:42,460
have into account when you're

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:45,300
classifying the errors this is a good

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,300
suggestion thanks

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,540
the same

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,860
