sure thank you good morning everyone so

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,640
i'm julian i work at maps in and i'm

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,230
going to tell you a little story today

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,080
about a bug we had a couple months ago

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,429
and it's a sort of i guess like a in a

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,870
Shakespearean play I guess we'll start

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,800
I'll introduce all the characters and

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,140
then we'll see how they combine so this

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,029
is Denmark it's a small country it's not

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,920
too far from here maybe if some of you

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,550
are from there you live there or you've

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,500
been there I hear it's quite nice this

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,869
is Sweden's not quite as small not quite

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,840
as near I also hear it's really nice

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,420
never been there and this is Copenhagen

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,950
it's the capital of Denmark I hear it's

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,390
great place and this is the home page of

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,530
the police gioco dear so you can go

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,789
there if you have questions about it

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,140
there's there's a link and if you don't

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,780
happen to know what a decoder is for the

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,030
purposes of this little talk it's

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,430
basically you it's the thing that lets

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,840
you type in something like this and it

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,250
should give you the right place on the

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,589
map and it generally does this is map

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,729
elyria you may have just seen a

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,830
lightning talk they're good people and

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,110
they're especially awesome because they

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,790
use palios on their homepage which is

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,350
great and we are very happy that they're

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,000
they're using it and we've generally got

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,600
good feedback from them they're also

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,270
based in Sweden incidentally so one day

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,590
in New York City we were waking up in

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,430
the morning and we checked Twitter and

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,530
we saw something like this so this is a

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,020
tweet maybe look at that first result

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,960
and see if you see anything slightly odd

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,500
ah so if you remember from a few seconds

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,780
ago Copenhagen is is actually in Denmark

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,509
and and we have it showing up as in

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,049
Sweden which is I guess some people were

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,670
a little angry to sit some of your

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,070
laughing you might know that there's

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,460
there's been some contention apparently

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,950
around who controlled copenhagen in in

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,700
the past few centuries so it's a bit of

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,130
a sore subject so what what happened

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,590
here it's a really good question so we

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,500
started digging into things and as part

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,759
of polyus we we have a data set that we

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,560
use called who's on first which has

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,180
information on countries and cities and

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,590
whatnot and when when we were initially

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,720
calculating like the parent

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,099
for that data we used being programmers

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,110
we use the simplest thing that we would

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,680
think could possibly work so this is

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,110
Hovis cotton it's the region in Denmark

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,269
surrounding Copenhagen and you can see

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,010
up on the Left there's Copenhagen and

00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:30,900
you can see them there's this little

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,930
island down on the down on the right

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,640
it's also part of that same region and

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,700
so so when we were calculating this this

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,319
parentage we we did the simplest thing

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,180
you've probably done this if you've done

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,519
any sort of geometry work we made a

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,010
bounding box it's this gray square right

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,989
it's the box that surrounds everything

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,459
in that region and then we took the

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,840
exact center of that box and you can see

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,420
the little crosshair in the center and

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,910
then we asked you know what country is

00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:02,280
there well it's definitely Sweden and

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,410
that's definitely wrong but there's

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,840
something really interesting so it turns

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,430
out according to wikipedia a couple

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,069
hundred years ago there's this this guy

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,829
named King Charles Gustav of of Sweden

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,500
and he really really thought that

00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:17,880
Copenhagen should be part of Sweden

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,609
rather than Denmark and so I think he

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,100
went out and captured it and you know

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:25,280
eventually he was repelled and

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:28,200
eventually piece was had all around but

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,940
apparently uh you know the Danes who

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,470
took back Copenhagen they didn't really

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,930
stop there and they took over a little

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,880
bit of Sweden as well and then there

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,880
were some negotiations and and that part

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,430
of Sweden was given back to Sweden in

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,000
exchange for that little island down in

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,730
the corner so you know King Charles may

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,480
not have gotten Copenhagen like he

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,040
wanted in the 1600s or so it seemed but

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,889
at least according to pelas for a few

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,889
hours in April thanks to the Danes who

00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,450
recaptured it he did so if you want to

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,209
know more we have a blog post with all

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,480
the correct dates and fun facts and and

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,120
cool pictures so please feel free to

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,560
read about it and enjoy a funny little

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,799
story and you want to learn more about

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,329
palace or geocoding or other fun geo

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,380
trivia which there's a lot feel free to

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:18,380
chat with me later things

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,269
