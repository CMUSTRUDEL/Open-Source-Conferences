(sound issues present in the first 50 seconds of the recording)

Yuri will describe how Wikipedia is building a map service using OSM data and discuss how Wikimedia would like to encourage closer ties between OSM and Wikipedia communities. If time permits he will cover the technical aspects of the new service they built.

hi um usually this presentation is for

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:35,910
about 30 minutes all very switch so we

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:40,070
can get the comedian all right we'll do

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:44,489
the classical way all right very quickly

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:47,129
go I am yuriai work for Wikipedia from

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,610
wikimedia foundation um about a year and

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,100
a half ago I started the project with a

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,379
few my colleagues to get maps into

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,829
Wikipedia world there's a good reason

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,289
for it I mean we're Wikipedia is pretty

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,660
big but and it has tons of geospatial

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,850
related information but there's no maps

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,250
people are forced to upload images I

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,450
mean imagine SVG's and PNG's in a modern

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:17,909
world representing the world

00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:19,380
geographical data so our first

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,979
deliverable something that's already

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,530
active on most wiki projects except

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,759
Wikipedia which is a map frame you can

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,900
insert a map directly into the page

00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,150
Wikipedia is not there simply because

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,310
we're afraid for our servers to insert

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,530
it because of the traffic once we get

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,450
the snapshots system so that you can

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,009
show this image as a snapshot and then

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,540
click and activate and then interact

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,549
with it then we'll switch it on in

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,460
English Wikipedia will probably enable

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,240
it in smaller wikipedias pretty soon

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,220
other projects such as wikivoyage

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,270
Commons wiki data they already have this

00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:02,000
support the cool thing is that you can

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:05,850
actually edit with Vicky data you can

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,009
yeah you can write very complex Sparkle

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,129
query against Ricky data and extract

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,870
data from it and draw it on the map and

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,660
that functionality is also already

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,420
available

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,820
like for example here it's a governors

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,320
of the United States drawn right on top

00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,410
of the map with their party affiliations

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,990
and pictures and also all control this

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,330
can be done by users there's some stuff

00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:31,930
that being done by Julian integration of

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,210
maps into search in comments where the

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,250
picture was taken into wiki data

00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:39,130
coordinates again something to simplify

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,470
it um as I said which data query results

00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,230
can be amazing you can really tell a

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,350
story there this is a little thing about

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,880
my little plug that someone else did for

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,560
the editor where you insert the

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,670
Wikipedia article and that all might

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,160
acquaintance sir it's a wicked data ID

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,170
without wiki data IDs we will not be

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,060
able to show the relevant information so

00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,980
please please please pay more attention

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,680
to wiki data IDs and I would love to

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,150
talk to whoever wants to talk about

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,100
automating this process even further I

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:11,020
know how or some community love sports

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:12,640
um you know I know so lots of data

00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,310
visualizations I will show it in one

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,100
second and it all runs on Carter

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,020
Therrien which is another shameless plug

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:27,100
this is the server that we wrote to

00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:29,080
render vector a vector tiles to the for

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,580
everyone so this is how it looks like

00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,660
you see there's a link you click on that

00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,830
it pops up the map you can just like

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,150
view of you what it looks like and

00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:42,459
obviously it's zoomable and everything

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,780
from there is another little thing this

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,500
is a totally different system it's

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,630
called graphs which allows you to draw

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,200
the same Joe shapes directly from where

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:56,080
sm but also like with capitals and

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,390
however all this can be done by users

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,220
this is not something that so any

00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,010
developers have to do on the back end

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,830
and it's that's the beauty of the data

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,989
driven design I'll take some questions

00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,760
now because otherwise I kind of rushed

00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:24,419
through it and I know a few things are

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:55,090
not clear questions yeah I guess yeah oh

00:04:24,419 --> 00:05:01,060
there's a question here i have the

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:03,910
license the the licensing uh we're

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,250
basically it's gonna be an open license

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,900
it's already an open license our legal

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,590
department is still working on final

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:15,000
terms of that but basically it's a

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:17,650
probably cc-by that's my guess would be

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,789
again something to be clarified with the

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,460
legal department that i'm pretty sure

00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:23,470
that's what it's going to be and my hope

00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,140
is that you'll be able to embed it into

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,110
directly into different wiki sites

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:41,200
different sites there was a question

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:43,830
here I'm happy I'm providing some

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,830
entertainment here

00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,750
how about we pass this mic

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:12,050
thank you there was some rendering for

00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:15,870
international displaying languages in

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:23,550
wikimedia foundation i would like what

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:27,060
becomes this project so I this is a huge

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,430
huge problem for us we want to render

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,700
maps in every possible language

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,830
currently the fundamental issue is that

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,210
map Nick does not support each store in

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,760
other words there's no possibility to

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,310
stick every possible translation of a

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,500
road or a city into vector tile once

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,100
it's possible we'll render it in every

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:51,690
possible way if someone wants to take on

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:55,410
map Nick c++ please come forward yeah I

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,910
thought so yeah so it's a problem a we

00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,970
actually have a developer who is willing

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,310
to work on that we just need some give

00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,200
them some help to get started like write

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,760
a unit test of what's expected of them

00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,110
and they'll they'll do the work they

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,010
really did some math Nick work for us

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:15,120
solving international font issue with

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:19,340
multilingual so bug any other questions

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,340
