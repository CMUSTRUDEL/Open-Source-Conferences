	Svenja Heinecke (Sozialhelden e.V.), State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/T112-The_new_Wheelmap__Joining_forces_in_accessibility_mapping___feat____I_Wheel_Share_/

In 2010, Wheelmap was launched as a mapping interface of the OSM celebrating the introduction of the “wheelchair tag”. Over 850,000 coloured ratings have appeared in Wheelmap since. Recently, Wheelmap has undergone some important changes: The development of a new backend called Accessibility.Cloud provides an exchange format for sharing data from a variety of sources – because other NGOs and initiatives have done similar work and started to collect accessibility data using their own applications. An example is the French mapping community “I wheel share”. Svenja, the community manager from Wheelmap.org and Florian from iwheelshare.com will give you a little tour, from the backend of Accessibility.Cloud to the frontend of the new Wheelmap where the enhancements become visible, along with its well-proven, adapted and new functionalities. We want to show you how all of us OSM-, iwheelshare-, and Wheelmappers can increase the impact of accessibility mapping together.

okay hello everyone nice to meet you

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,490
guys here and thanks for dropping into

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:12,509
this talk which will be about the latest

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:16,130
developments on louia map org and yeah

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,320
and how this has opened up a space for

00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:23,070
further corporations within the field of

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,439
accessibility mapping and yeah so I am

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,880
Svenja and I'm from from the team office

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,490
of sale Helen which is a nonprofit

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,340
organization in Berlin and we are

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:37,910
running the wheelmap since 2010 as one

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:41,550
of our main projects and next to me I

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:43,920
everybody I'm flowing on a situation

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,950
which is a small startup from Paris and

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,600
we are doing accessibility applications

00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,890
yeah and why we are here together you

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,510
will get to know in the next ten minutes

00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,000
it has to do with the rise development

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,719
and yeah the cold Parisians which has

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,520
became has become possible from that so

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,890
but first of all all those associations

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,600
dealing with accessibility they were

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,009
running into the same problem several

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:20,759
years ago because yeah we were always

00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:24,630
wondering on which places are accessible

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,790
and how we can information on that and

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,340
it they were always hard to find and

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,439
they were not available in a in a

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,650
collection where we could have an

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:39,119
overview of yeah all those places in a

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:42,630
city or worldwide so and for people who

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,390
use a wheelchair in the daily lives or a

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,020
walking frame or move around with

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:53,369
strollers well this makes it pretty hard

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:57,060
to take part in daily life so so the CL

00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:01,229
Helen came up with their solution we

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:05,670
built wheelmap org and yeah it is

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:09,090
running for 8 years now and it works

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,420
pretty fine it's evolved and now we've

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,380
got 900 thousand places which we can

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,590
display in

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,020
our map and which is of course open

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,950
source and open data and well

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,470
community-driven

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:26,400
that's also why it has been translated

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,400
into 25 languages and and yeah and we

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,830
will web a web application but also

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,220
applications for iPhone and Android

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,530
which can be downloaded for free so and

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,470
you see here it's on the first side it's

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:44,520
pretty simple it's a traffic light

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,140
system to get you an idea directly as a

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,510
user of which places are wheelchair

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:54,080
accessible and which are not and well of

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,330
course it is an Open Street Map editor

00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,120
that's that's what's the connection here

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:04,080
and we are focusing on those three texts

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,750
you see here so it's the wheelchair tech

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,880
we've introduced and which gladly became

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,970
accepted by the OpenStreetMap community

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,510
when we started which is the wheelchair

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:18,210
equals yes no limited then later on we

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:21,650
introduced a toilet TAC for wheelchairs

00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:24,480
so toilets wheelchairs no and there's

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,370
the tag which description where you can

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,980
leave through the comments on the

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,500
accessibility of a place so and as you

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,210
see it's it has been widely accepted and

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,710
the OpenStreetMap community there's more

00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:41,490
than 1.3 million uses of the we attack

00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:43,740
so far and yeah and so it has

00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,560
contributed a lot for us to have those

00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:51,060
900 places for the note types we display

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,970
on William a park yeah and the reason

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,790
why it worked so well as we see it is

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,850
that it's the criteria is pretty easy to

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,480
understand for mappers so it's focusing

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,160
on one one main thing which is the step

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,540
at the entrance and the step in the

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,900
indoor facilities so it's yeah it's

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:16,530
something that you can X a mine pretty

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,359
easily with just some minutes of time to

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,950
go into the place check up on the step

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:26,520
and check on the indoor rooms and then

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:29,460
you can add the text with just a few

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,290
clicks and save it on we may pork which

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,020
will then be distributed and transferred

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,930
to OpenStreetMap as well and of course

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:41,750
this the second factor and while worked

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:44,550
so well was the community approach so

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:48,390
we've got or we have we've attracted a

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,790
community which is specialized or just a

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:54,810
special interest group in accessibility

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:57,720
issues so we work together with with

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,260
seniors or which of with wheelchair

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:05,130
users themselves you see themselves as

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,380
experts in their own issue and take

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:13,230
responsibility and go out mapping their

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:16,140
neighborhoods yes and while we while we

00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,660
were doing all this of course other

00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,050
associations and activists were kind of

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,410
going in the same direction and for

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,960
instance there is check set in France

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,460
with their own community and they have

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,160
gathered more than 100 thousand places

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,370
up till today and we've got for instance

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,480
also access maps and use a with also

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:42,300
around 100 places and well and smaller

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,570
communities like I will share who have

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,450
found their solutions as well to work

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,090
with their community and get information

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:57,210
on accessibility and places from their

00:05:51,090 --> 00:06:00,290
community as well so because all those

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,750
associations were doing their things and

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:08,640
having different strategies to collect

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:11,970
data and crowdsource the data there was

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,990
one point where we thought why don't we

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,430
open up the space and collaborate on a

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,670
larger scale with each other because

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:23,880
it's almost important that people

00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:26,850
wherever they are and use a wheelchair

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,340
can find places and information on

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:32,780
accessibility and no matter where they

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,780
are at that point and

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,520
yeah and we build the data exchange

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,620
service to allow all those data sources

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:45,229
to interact with each other to be

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:47,479
available and and to share and all of

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:50,419
that would be with the goal to have to

00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:55,430
increase impact and to raise further

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:59,030
awareness for accessibility and yeah and

00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:01,850
what's what's interesting is that when

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,860
we did that now we were going further

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,169
than just focusing on wheelchair

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,430
accessibility right now we've got more

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:14,509
than 150 different attributes describing

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:16,250
accessibility so also if a place is

00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:20,120
accessible for blind people or for deaf

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:22,610
people and so it's really going further

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,380
on that source and there are three texts

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:31,699
I've just shown you we are using

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:34,520
appFolio map park yes and so this made

00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:38,990
it necessary for us as well to to work

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:41,750
on a new relaunch again for we map org

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:44,630
so that's what we're doing for several

00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:48,110
months now because this new

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:51,919
accessibility cloud will become the new

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:56,090
backend of wheel map and this implicates

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:58,599
some some new features and also some

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:02,919
changes in the infrastructure we've made

00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:06,199
so first of all we are displaying now

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:09,470
the sources from the accessibility cloud

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,380
on William a Park so that means that

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:16,789
also sources like from I will share are

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:20,780
displayed here in the map sorry and all

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:23,419
together we've got this more than 1.6

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:26,270
million places right now so that's much

00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:30,590
more than those 900 900 places which are

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:34,880
displayed a loom a park and and yeah and

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:37,520
you see you well here we don't have the

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,360
possibility to edit the source on the

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,880
map but rather for words users to go to

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,370
the to the site of the data source where

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,779
it comes from

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:52,600
and in this it becomes clear yeah that

00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:58,089
it's that it's a lot of sources we're

00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:01,060
working here and yeah so that's that's

00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:06,459
one new feature to show more sources on

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:09,310
we map org we've also changed the

00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:14,439
feature on how we do how we deal with

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:16,769
edits which go further than just adding

00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:20,259
the wheelchair tax so the wheelchair tax

00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:22,449
the main three ones I've shown you they

00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:26,410
basically stay the same they are belong

00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:30,250
to the core product a we map for adding

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,920
new places or working editing addresses

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:39,399
and stuff which is much more sensible in

00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:42,639
terms of OpenStreetMap data we now

00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,189
forward people while we give those two

00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,379
possibilities so either we you can leave

00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:50,019
a note as a user who is not familiar

00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:55,949
with working with OpenStreetMap so far

00:09:50,019 --> 00:10:00,279
or if you are a metal which has gathered

00:09:55,949 --> 00:10:03,579
some more experience you can go to the

00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:06,220
OpenStreetMap editor itself and lock in

00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:10,540
and do the normal process which you

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:18,069
would do as an open street map so that's

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:21,060
new as well and then which is even

00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:24,370
exceeds even a bit further the the

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:28,059
feature of just showing more sources it

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:31,910
is that we can now also display real

00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:33,480
time data so we've integrated

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,540
[Music]

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,490
information on escalators and elevators

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,069
which will well which will change the

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,430
color when they are out of operation or

00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:48,160
in operation again so it's it's kind of

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:52,240
an automatic process where it switches

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,960
from green to to red when an elevator is

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,790
not working

00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,060
so yeah these are three main features

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:03,180
and the new ones here's again an

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:06,990
overview on the infrastructure how it

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:10,400
looks now so we still have OpenStreetMap

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:13,680
as a the main bucket and geo database

00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,300
which feeds into the we met back ends at

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,360
the same time you see all those other

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,410
data sources which feed and it feeds

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,950
into the parallel back-end of

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,810
accessibility cloud and at all yeah it

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:29,340
creates an API and then it's all

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:32,880
displayed again in in we map is one user

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:37,920
interface and from that of course from

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:43,350
that API which is can be shared and used

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:47,940
for new apps to be developed okay and

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:51,510
yeah and how this all impacts on other

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:55,730
apps we will show you with the example

00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,730
of I will share and I hand over to you

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,050
so yeah so I

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,110
I wish shells of course the vision of

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:07,170
social Elden and this accessibility

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:10,230
cloud which is more than only a map but

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:13,830
also comes with a technical structure to

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,960
use with the API and the repository so

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,000
here you have the represent or of I will

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,000
share in the accessibility cloud we have

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,610
like 2000 places but most of the edits

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,450
we do directly them in in OpenStreetMap

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:32,010
and we used it's through the

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:35,790
accessibility lab so what we decided is

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:39,060
to go to to develop a tool which will

00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:43,170
fit the needs of our users the disabled

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:45,600
people and so this is a chatbot that

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,490
could be used directly in facebook

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,180
Messenger and very soon we'll have a web

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,860
version and I'll show you a bit it's in

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,780
French but basically it's it's very

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,410
simple I'll show you okay let's have a

00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,130
try so it just say hello I'm Wilson how

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,740
can I help you

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,060
and then you can pick a service so for

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,270
example you are in a wheelchair you

00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,310
you want to find toilets around you that

00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,430
are available for a father for the

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,810
wheelchairs oh and we haven't seen it

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:19,900
but very quickly you have the results

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:22,120
and it says this data comes from the

00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,700
OpenStreetMap community but it could

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,400
also come from other sources so mixing

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,620
sources is the second point so this is

00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,280
another service here I'm looking for a

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,930
place to stay and I find a note hell

00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,120
here comes from the OpenStreetMap

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,040
community so it comes directly this one

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,590
is from accessible net which is a

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,980
partner of us this one is from to his

00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:49,750
MIDI cap which is a French label about

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,370
tourism so you can see that this the

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,550
accessibility cloud allows us to work

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:57,160
with a lot of partners so too is my only

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,380
cap as I said a label so it's like from

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,070
a public institution but we are also

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:06,010
banks on this power is the French spot

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:09,460
on the spot Federation and the share

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:12,190
like spot places for the for the

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:19,540
disabled people to go and we have also a

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:21,970
toilets tourism leisure cinema a lot of

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,700
partners so yeah this accessibility

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,780
cloud allows us very quickly to embed

00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:32,140
the data which could be a raw data or

00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:36,210
the API is directly to work with

00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:42,390
directly on a very standard standard

00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:46,810
technical documentation so for example

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:50,410
how could I display all the cinemas for

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:53,530
the people that are in a wheelchair I

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:56,050
find the places of the of the cinemas

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,360
directly in OpenStreetMap and in France

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,600
it wasn't that good so we we made a lot

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,430
of edits to to to have the the data

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,070
better directly in the past remap and

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:10,210
then we have this partner 12x which is

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:12,250
like really dedicated to find the

00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,710
accessibility of these places so they

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,630
have the data and they they don't know

00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,089
anything about technology so they will

00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,610
not

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:23,240
put it in OpenStreetMap so they have the

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:26,720
data we just imported in India access

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:30,259
via cloud and the last partner each a

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,499
lucinei which will be the IMDB of France

00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:36,079
and they have all the the timetable the

00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:39,939
schedules of the of the of the of the

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:43,069
cinema so we mix these three sources and

00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:46,279
directly within the the chatbots we have

00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:50,300
we have the answer so there is only one

00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:54,499
tool to to have all this data which is

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:59,990
very convenient so it's made possible

00:15:54,499 --> 00:16:01,579
because of of course open data so we can

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:06,040
share the data but also because it's

00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:09,350
standardized so this is an example of

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,839
toilets is the described in the index

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:15,199
SVG cloud so you can see that there is

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,749
the the eight of the the base the the

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,149
space that sits on the on the on the

00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:22,929
left side the space on the right side

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:27,470
the space in the front this is like very

00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:31,819
detailed and you can as it has been said

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:34,819
there is more than 150 parameters that

00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:37,550
you can you can you can have so this is

00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:40,790
a very precise it could be very simple

00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:48,079
but also very precise this is another

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:51,079
example from table which is in Bly which

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,199
there is an audio description is it's

00:16:51,079 --> 00:17:02,300
printed in big so this is these are the

00:16:54,199 --> 00:17:04,850
details you can you cannot directly well

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:08,569
what what can you what can you do now to

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:10,809
you know when we can collaborate on such

00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:14,390
a scale which as an accessibility data

00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:18,010
how can we how can we go even further

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:19,970
and especially also in the direction of

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,880
the collaboration with the Open Street

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:26,720
Map community and collecting more data

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,480
and ensuring its quality and there's a

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:34,409
bunch of call to actions

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:38,490
I collected so first of all yeah let's

00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:42,269
talk about on how we can promote the

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:44,909
wheelchair tax within all mapping events

00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:48,870
we are doing or to bring that further in

00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:54,179
the awareness of mapping events in

00:17:48,870 --> 00:18:00,830
general and and also you see when well

00:17:54,179 --> 00:18:03,899
now that that mapping will also comprise

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:07,289
editing in into OpenStreetMap directly

00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:09,799
on how can we bring the OSM was em

00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:14,399
expertise into you into common events

00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:18,750
and to find a way on yeah on having a

00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:19,470
concept to ensure data quality and of

00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,539
course

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,500
well now that there are so many other

00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:30,840
data sources which which are there which

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:33,090
are present how can we find a process to

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:37,860
add the extra accessory data of those

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:43,049
sources and well and life later to add

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:45,299
them to to OpenStreetMap as well so yeah

00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:50,519
so I don't know let's talk about this

00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:54,240
maybe we can discuss this in the Q&A and

00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:56,960
also come to us and yeah and tell us

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,250
your ideas on how we can do that and

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,440
yeah of course you can you can have a

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,149
look at how the new wheel map will look

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,490
like with all these new features and

00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:08,130
more data sources when you go to we

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:11,490
mapped org slash be there and I want to

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:15,990
invite you to go there test it and yeah

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:19,440
just see how it works and yeah that's

00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:22,409
that's it for now and yeah thanks for

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,139
attention and if you have any questions

00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:26,990
very welcome to go into discussion right

00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:34,409
now thanks

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:37,539
[Applause]

00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:41,049
Sueno you said you're using data from

00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:43,779
here maps which data do you use and how

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:48,220
do you deal with the share alike laws of

00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:50,850
the OpenStreetMap license well so here

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:55,029
he maps is one of the sources and

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:56,679
they've got they've started mapping or

00:19:55,029 --> 00:20:01,600
giving information about access

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:03,580
accessibility as well so and we just

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,320
mentioned the harmonization of data and

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,029
the attributes we're collecting an

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,269
accessibility cloud it's a new back-end

00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:14,610
but we're also handling licenses and

00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:18,580
kind of giving options on what kind of

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:20,740
license they pick and what kind of

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,759
interchange they allow with all the

00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:26,860
other sources so for us it's well one

00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:30,730
thing is that they get displayed in into

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:36,940
we map org and yeah and then they can

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:40,149
just yeah they give the license on how

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:44,169
they created it and then well there's

00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:47,970
several levels of how open the data is

00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:52,119
and well they just choose themself on

00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:54,809
how far they want to go and this in just

00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:59,200
sharing the data so that's that's how

00:20:54,809 --> 00:21:03,070
well a license model is also kind of

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,600
part of accessibility cloud here this

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:11,190
does it answer your question

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:14,919
not really so we'll points-of-interest

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:17,320
form here maps appear in will map beside

00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:18,779
Open Street Map points of interest of

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,220
the same category

00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:23,220
well they okay

00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:31,720
I can introduce Hollywood who's the

00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,309
product manager of Wilma Park and runs

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,600
the project accessibility cloud as well

00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:36,580
hi yeah

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,679
so we displaying them a separate layer

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,769
so they are completely independent they

00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,749
have their own latitude longitude so

00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:45,610
they collect us the data so from the

00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:48,070
here mac we're a team when other

00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:51,279
partners Foursquare for example and they

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,110
allow us so say will map to display this

00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,029
on will map so we're not putting this in

00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,799
OpenStreetMap or anything but we also

00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:58,990
have many sources which are open like

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,619
open government data which is compatible

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:04,389
with OD BL and what we make them choose

00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:06,580
in the beginning is to state explicitly

00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:11,139
like - is it all rights reserved

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:13,149
is it share like is it CC 0 or ODB L so

00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:15,700
that others can also use the API to just

00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:17,740
get a bunch of data so we are not the

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,539
role to share you know data from here

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:26,549
from Foursquare there just displaying it

00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:30,029
on will map is this more clear now ok

00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:30,029
other question

00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:39,000
how can the user add more detailed

00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,310
information of an access for example in

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,380
a park when where you have a ramp but a

00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:46,470
very bad ground to transit to the

00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,870
bathroom and how the application for the

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,180
final final user can transmit this

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,490
information so you have an access

00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,830
successive goods but you can't transit

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,860
in the zone well this this this kind of

00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:01,230
information is not shown from

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:04,560
OpenStreetMap data in we map walk right

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:07,640
now but what's possible is that from the

00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:10,290
other data sources we are integrated

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,170
that you might have seen for the I would

00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:16,560
say example that it was a field where a

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:19,590
lot of text appeared so whenever the

00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,660
community has has gathered something in

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,210
a text format it will be displayed as

00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:28,110
well giving some more information about

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:30,720
it but we at the moment what we display

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:33,960
on on we a map in terms of which access

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:39,270
ability I just use three text I've shown

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:42,390
you so it's it's if the switch is now

00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:45,840
limited the description and toilet

00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,420
information we just have time for one

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,930
last question

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:54,090
thank you are there any other interfaces

00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:56,070
to the accessibility cloud besides the

00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,850
website so can you repeat there was just

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,320
some noise yes are there any other

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,600
interfaces to the accessibility cloud

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,000
besides the website so are there any API

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,670
is are there any possibilities to for

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,170
others to get data maybe the data that

00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:15,840
is allowed to access just just like the

00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:18,300
infrastructure the backends so and we

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,970
map kind of is one example of how this

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:24,120
API can work on the interface of we map

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,670
org I which is another example where

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,610
they with the IP is used in a chatbot

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:33,210
solution so you can you can grab this

00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:34,920
API and well it's it's open-source code

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,620
to build your own applications with that

00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,450
right but the data is not are there is

00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:45,630
there an open API for the data that was

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:48,210
the question yes just first question

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,950
I think maybe partially a comment to

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,470
earlier question if I understood it

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,420
correctly I'm working on a project with

00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,090
the University of Washington to map

00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,890
sidewalks and we're mapping sidewalks

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,110
make sure we have proper width for

00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,860
wheelchairs mapping the curb cuts

00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:09,630
mapping the crosswalks marked unmarked

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:10,830
buttons to push because just having no

00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:13,170
any business as wheelchair access

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,180
doesn't mean you can get to it

00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:20,340
the other thing that they've done it's

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:22,920
really impressive is they have a access

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,920
map that I oh where you can go in there

00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,680
and this is a demo for Seattle Seattle's

00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,690
a very hilly city and so to get a

00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,670
wheelchair around you you have to go run

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:36,060
quite aways but it will take advantage

00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:40,470
of elevators and they use the open hours

00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:42,950
tagged and osm to allow you to say I can

00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,870
use the elevator if the building's open

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:49,260
and the one last question real question

00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:51,570
I have is when you're working in for

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,100
accessibility for the blind I have you

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:56,790
thought about screen readers for the

00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,470
blind for map tiles because right now

00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,950
when you when a screen reader sees a map

00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,380
tile

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:05,190
it just says map tile metamath tile map

00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:09,120
a map - yeah well it's in the beta

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:12,480
version after Sony we've we've really

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,120
made sure that the app itself is it was

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,960
accessible as well so it can be used by

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:25,470
by screen readers it can be put into

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:27,180
your audio format so yeah that that's it

00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,070
that's basically it so we've improved

00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:32,850
that a lot compared to the other

00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:35,650
application we were running so far so

00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:38,639
thank you very much

00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:41,639
[Applause]
