Description: 
	Drishtie Patel (Facebook), State of the Map 2018
https://2018.stateofthemap.org/2018/T078-OSM_at_Facebook/

Over the past year a team at Facebook has been using machine learning algorithms to help human mappers edit and validate faster. In addition to sharing how we use OSM in product, connectivity and disaster response you can learn about the AI-Assisted Road Tracing Import currently being done in Thailand. We will talk about the tools we have created to support this effort, the lessons learned and share our next steps.

hey everyone thanks for hanging in for

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,740
three days it's been a really fun event

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,269
so thank you to everyone who helped work

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,460
on it as somebody who's been on a

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,679
conference planning to you I know it's a

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,190
lot of work so good job to all the

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,190
planning team

00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:27,609
so we get a lot of questions about why

00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:31,099
we use Matt but why we're involved in

00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:33,379
OSM and the very simple answer is that

00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:36,530
we actually use osm in our product so

00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:39,190
how many people have seen a Maps product

00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:43,550
in one of the Facebook family of apps

00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:45,260
okay I want to say that's 50% so you've

00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,489
definitely seen that little map pop up

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,930
either in your checking stories

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:53,030
messenger location Instagram places

00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,510
there's now the marketplace to sell and

00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,830
buy things there's lots of different

00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,400
functionalities and and apps within the

00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,839
Facebook family that used maps so if you

00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,790
if you've seen it then you know that

00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:07,400
we're predominantly a display feature

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,560
and so while we're not an exact product

00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,680
within Facebook we do support a lot of

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,290
the products who need a map surface so

00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,570
last year when we talked about OSM we

00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,280
mentioned that we were rolling out and

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,770
we were in about 22 countries and these

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,310
are the countries that were running on

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:29,350
osm and we're happy to say that in the

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,350
last six months we're about here

00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,970
so it's been a very interesting time

00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:43,300
we've been a going non-stop long crazy

00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,980
hours we've had a lot of good successes

00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,210
and we've also had some challenges

00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,550
because you don't know what you don't

00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,250
know sometimes when you're doing it for

00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,800
the first time but it's been really fun

00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,570
and I'm gonna talk about kind of our

00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,840
dynamic within the team and how we've

00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,880
split things up so these are our two

00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,510
streams of work that we focus on within

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,970
Facebook this is our QA work and the

00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:10,720
very technical term remove that stuff

00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,040
team so that's one of the streams and

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,740
we're going to go into more detail so

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,990
you can see things with pictures and

00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,010
then we also have our second stream of

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,140
work which you guys are probably

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,800
familiar with based on the last talk and

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,110
we call this the add good stuff team and

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,290
so basically you can see the top one is

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,940
more about quality and making sure that

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,010
the the map that we use is free of

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,480
vandalism and we do a lot of work there

00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,270
to try and understand what's going on in

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,459
the base map so that we can use it in

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,350
different places we have more than two

00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,810
billion users so anything that is on

00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:47,110
there is definitely visible to a lot

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,060
more people and then our good stuff is

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,770
out a I assisted road tracing which is

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,080
basically using machine learning to help

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:56,140
us do things a little bit faster so we

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,940
go into some more detail there so you

00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,350
can see based on the icons we do a lot

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,030
of searching and then we have a

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:04,330
validation process and then eventually

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,310
we have like a final checklist so let's

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,870
talk about profanity this is something

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,050
that we're obviously super concerned

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,730
about because I don't think we have a

00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,140
full grasp of everything that's in our

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,239
so I'm especially because of the

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,000
different link languages that render in

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,620
different locations and also it's just a

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,980
really hard problem to tackle because

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,570
there's no one full database of all of

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,610
the bad words that could potentially be

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,250
in there so first we started with

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,230
creating a list of potential profanity

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,989
so this meant scouring the internet for

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,640
bad words so if anyone walked past my

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,910
laptop they definitely saw some weird

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,799
stuff on there but then we also have a

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,580
lot of integrity teams at Facebook that

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,830
focus on these kinds of things and

00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,930
lots of language supports so by asking

00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,400
pts to kind of go through and fill these

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,320
lists for different languages we ended

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,530
up with a list of about 39 thousand

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,180
words in 43 different languages which I

00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,430
know is not confront completely

00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,690
comprehensive but it we felt at least a

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,690
little bit safer for what we were

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:05,030
looking at and then secondly we went

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,610
through and validated against this

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,010
dictionary of words throughout the OSM

00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:13,700
PDF file and what we found was that we

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,440
found 84,000 flagged words so while we

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,019
do have an editing team this is still a

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,760
lot of words to go through manually so

00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,709
we started doing some filtering and so

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,300
if you think about some of the words

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,700
that could show up on an integrity list

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,850
some of them actually might be shops in

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,380
the shops or restaurant names too and so

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,680
we did some filtering so that we would

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,540
eventually have a much smaller list that

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,520
we can actually manually QA and then

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,380
look at words that are more contextually

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,870
based so then we ended up with about

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,840
2000 of these and we manually checked

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,550
them and what we was super happy about

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,290
after all of this especially seeing

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,970
these numbers there was only a hundred

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,520
and thirty nine of them that were true

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,930
positives so actually bad words some of

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,520
them had been in there for about five

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,750
years but because they weren't maybe the

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,270
language that was rendering they

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,780
probably weren't flagged manually so we

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:04,580
went ahead and fix those in osm um this

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,050
is a little bit about our team so in

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,110
addition to having the resources of

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,300
always asking within the wider Facebook

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,310
network of language support our actual

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,750
editing team speaks these languages and

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:18,650
have lived in different place so we make

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,630
sure to hire diversity not only from

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,640
places but also languages so that when

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,900
we're cueing these things people are

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,760
from the countries that are there so

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,330
they have much better context on what

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,220
we're looking at this was the map but

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,510
just to show before we filtered it out

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:37,130
what the profanity looked like across

00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,140
the world and you can see that there's a

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,790
lot more in English that's because our

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,830
list for obviously English was much

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,960
larger but then there's a lot of false

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,600
positives in here so I you know I wanted

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,790
like make sure to us to mention that

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,449
this is not all of the bad words and not

00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,860
representative of how vandalism

00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:57,789
but it's just the first thing that

00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:00,279
popped us to popped up to us the next

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:04,479
thing that we do with the OSM data is we

00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:07,629
also run osm Chow so we picked about 33

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,580
of the most I guess important features

00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:12,580
that Facebook cares about in the display

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,490
functionalities and kind of went through

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:19,360
and we manually curate every single of

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:21,699
these in about 90% of the world and so

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,309
we we pretty much like had the entire

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:25,810
team and we did like a hack month and

00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:28,659
all we did every single day was go

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,550
through or some chat and bad words the

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:33,159
the nice thing about this is that if you

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,919
see the total counts for what it flagged

00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:38,979
as a potential issue versus the red line

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,759
which is the actual issue which in most

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:44,110
cases is less than 50% so that also

00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,629
helped us feel a little bit better

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,729
because we were then we then knew what

00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:51,219
we were working with but then there's

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:54,789
still a lot of other types of vandalism

00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:58,330
within our Sun that we weren't quite

00:06:54,789 --> 00:07:00,219
sure how to look at so we decided to use

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,999
some optical character recognition so

00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:07,149
this is also support that we have for

00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:08,469
within the Facebook infrastructure and

00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:11,740
to be able to do this we actually

00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:15,339
removed the labels from the PB FL and

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:18,849
then ran it on the raster Maps using

00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:21,969
these different training data sets and

00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:24,580
because x-ray is usually horizontal we

00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:26,050
did a couple of augmentation data sets

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,729
to be able to see them in different

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,319
views and so we can catch things at our

00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:32,830
different angles or upside down or

00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,899
reverse and it picked up all of them and

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,300
so we've also that also helped us feel a

00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:40,270
little bit better and you can see over

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,159
here kind of the words that it's it's

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,039
the letters it's picking up and then the

00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:46,659
detection confidence right over there

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,060
and this is one more example there's

00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:51,909
there's quite a few of these if you look

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,399
at the OSM cha or some of the talk lists

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:56,740
you'll see a couple of that they all the

00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,449
other thing to point out is that in the

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,409
in the case where there was labels it

00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:03,440
was a lower confidence so it was able to

00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:05,480
recognize

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,120
through size and shape it's a different

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,270
zoom levels what we were working with so

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,490
that was pretty much it on the vandalism

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,440
stuff you can definitely go into more

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,870
detail later

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,510
now for the adding good stuff the

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,360
machine learning roads that finally get

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:27,200
into OS n as you can see we have a ML

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,820
data model and then we add training data

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,590
which we create ourselves coupled with

00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,750
the DG imagery which is pretty much the

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,180
same one that's in OS m and available to

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,990
everyone do our road predictions

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,760
eventually we get some vectors we get a

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,289
raster map that we turn into vectors so

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,300
that we can merge it much better because

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,030
it's now the same file format as OS m

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,260
and then we have our editing team go

00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:52,280
through pretty much every one of those

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,230
tasks and it finally gets into OS m so

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,820
before we started doing that and I think

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,320
I've showed this map before but just for

00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,560
reference this is what your road

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,510
coverage looks like in OS m so you're

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,160
more developed countries that are blue

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,360
obviously have a lot more road coverage

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,330
but the minute you get out of these

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,160
areas into more developing nations it

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,870
starts to get less and less and this is

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,820
kind of the areas that do need more of

00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,280
help especially remote teams because

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,690
it's much harder to map on the ground so

00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,600
think about the conditions that people

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:25,130
are in you're dealing with like no Wi-Fi

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,830
really crazy terrain conditions not good

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:30,680
technology and so we feel like this is

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,950
important to us because it helps connect

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,370
people in those areas this is an example

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,380
of one of the raster outputs and you can

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,030
see based on the yellow that's our

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,010
population density which I'm also going

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,110
to talk about a little bit later but it

00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:48,020
the white is the roads that it's picking

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,030
up so we create our own datasets

00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,400
training datasets in house without

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,110
editors and these are basically examples

00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,540
of the types of training data sets these

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,670
are and simply this is in Photoshop we

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,370
just draw out every single road and so

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,110
the machine model can get a sense of the

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,880
different textures colors and widths

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,210
that it needs to look for within the

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,430
entire country and as we go through we

00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,050
also validate the results that are

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,760
coming out to see what it's missing and

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,570
then we can create a more specialized

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,890
data set

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:21,890
to add it to the model this is the raw

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:24,500
output and basically the darker it is

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,990
that's the more confident the confidence

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,550
of what it's picking up from the machine

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,620
learning and so you can see a different

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,870
thickness in the roads and using the

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,670
same example which is an area in

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,400
Indonesia you can see the

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:40,130
post-processing steps so we apply a

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,350
really high threshold as soon as the

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,940
output is completed to make sure that

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,460
we're super confident that it actually

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,290
is picking up roads which kind of throws

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,730
away the roads that were not confident

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,820
about which is why this image

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,980
particularly looks more fragmented and

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,160
then we extract a centerline from this

00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:00,730
image and then we go through the more

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,710
lower confidence areas and we trim out

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,570
roads and we connect the lower

00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,700
confidence areas and low confidence

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,010
areas doesn't usually mean there's no

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,480
road but if you look at satellite

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,700
imagery there's going to be areas where

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,370
the trees are covering or their shadow

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,350
or there's some greenery and and there

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:22,760
is most likely a road on the ground

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:25,100
it just has kind of a block with through

00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,690
the road we then go and remove the

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,410
island roads and this is the same

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,240
concept

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,430
usually these eyelet nodes actually do

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,800
exist but because we're mapping in more

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,270
rural areas so so far it's been Thailand

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,240
and Indonesia and we're starting from

00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:40,160
the outskirts moving into the city this

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,690
is areas that have a lot of greenery so

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,220
they tend to have a lot of these roads

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,290
that are seasonal and they change and

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,330
there's greenery and it all moves around

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,100
but for the sake of getting it into OS M

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,560
we want everything to connect into the

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,560
major road network and so we take them

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,410
out this is what it looks like when it

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,930
gets into ID so this is actually four

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,850
different tasks that would be put

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,700
together and you can see we have some

00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,680
color coordination and styling that we

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,560
do there to help our editors figure out

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:14,690
exactly what their mapping and what they

00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:16,250
need to focus on so this is the tasking

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,320
manager we've used the hot tasking

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,210
manager that's available open source and

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,610
we've added a couple of things that make

00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,310
sense for the way our team works in the

00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,950
process that

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,900
we do and so you'll see we actually have

00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,420
three editing steps so we have an editor

00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,610
a reviewer and a publisher so every

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,690
single tile that goes into osm is

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,880
actually if you'd by three different

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,070
people to make sure that nothing is

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,029
getting in there that might not be good

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:43,410
data we've done some logic building into

00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,940
the tasking manager because we're

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,770
dealing with roads we prefer people

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,240
don't edit right next to each other so

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:52,440
when you pick a random task it tries to

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,480
pick different tasks we have like a note

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,400
section so you can review and leave

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,110
notes to the editor so if there's any

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,060
training gaps we can fix that right away

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,830
and then we also have the ability to

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,600
read the files that are right next door

00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,130
so a lot of the times you don't want to

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,050
work in just the zone that you're

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,970
editing and you want to have contacts

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,680
for the full picture but we don't want

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,570
the ability to edit any of that data

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,940
because it could belong to a different

00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,920
person that's doing a task and so the

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,130
read-only file helps us to view these

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:24,810
files in an an editable way that gives

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:27,050
the mapper more context we have a ton of

00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,940
quality analysis in this step as well

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,410
we've customized the ID editor so we've

00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,240
added a ton of hotkeys and there's a

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,210
little video next that'll help explain

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,160
what this is we also use jos them for a

00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,170
full project review so once everything's

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,580
live you know at Sam we also go through

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,830
and do like a whole nother review

00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,050
process and then we use a lot of the

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:49,110
open-source tools like osm cosmos and

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,060
keeprite we these are actually built

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,070
into our task queue managers so they go

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,050
through the editing process and if we

00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,970
find any of these errors it actually

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:01,020
shows up as a task to our editors and

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:03,570
they can go through and fix those up so

00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,790
this is the ID it's actually on Oh some

00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:08,670
labs so if you wanted to use it it's

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:11,240
there but we've built validation checks

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:14,670
so these are very similar to Jotham

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,589
except it's right with an ID and it goes

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,450
through each of the lynchings and so we

00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,360
basically doesn't let you go to the next

00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,709
step unless you fixed all your issues

00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,570
we've done some custom road styling

00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,130
because that helps out editors kind of

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,339
see things a little bit more clearer it

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,350
helps us with hierarchy helps us to make

00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:34,380
sure that things are split and

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,300
merged correctly so there's a couple of

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,130
different features in there so editors

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,110
constantly make requests for things that

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,640
are doing a lot and so each time they do

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,320
that we have a feedback loop and we're

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,530
able to go through and make the changes

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,690
that they're looking for we have things

00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,540
like you know toggle through the hotkeys

00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,550
toggle through satellite imagery so you

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,820
can look at different types of imagery

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:59,850
going through much easier than you would

00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:02,130
you know clicking all the icons so this

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,230
was for Indonesia you guys do know we

00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,600
were working in Thailand we've also been

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,420
able to share some of the m/l vector

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,370
data with partners so this is from

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,550
Mexico and we ran the same model that we

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,380
used in Southeast Asia in Mexico and

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:20,520
we're able to get pretty decent results

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:24,990
so this was a city in Mexico it is not a

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:26,970
NOAA Sun this is just sample data we

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:31,140
then also have something similar for

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:33,300
Uganda that we shared with NGOs and you

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:37,080
can kind of see very similar results so

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,120
it seems to be doing pretty good we

00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,340
tried something very new for our work in

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,710
Indonesia luckily there was a there is a

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,540
very strong community in Indonesia

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:49,260
between humanity and OpenStreetMap and

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:51,240
local Indonesia so we were able to try a

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,850
different model this time so we actually

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,280
shared our vector data with the local

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:59,040
community and went over and did a

00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,900
training and opened up our tools for

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,660
them to be able to do that because it

00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,430
helps us they're the local community and

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,410
they know the area much better so this

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,650
seemed like a really good model for us

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,120
this time and basically how that went is

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,010
we spent the first three months just

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,810
cleaning up Indonesia so if anyone's

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:19,440
ever seen it there's a lot of

00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,910
misalignments some digitized roads that

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,490
may have been done a few years earlier

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:26,370
and so things were looked a little bit

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,110
differently some were not digitized so

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,300
great so we went through and spent about

00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,940
three months just cleaning up the entire

00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,470
country and so this was both teams at

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,830
Facebook and

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,660
in Indonesia and we used both the

00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:43,170
tasking manager and map roulette to find

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,480
and fix these issues we then did an

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,860
in-person training and went over with

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,990
our QA s and engineers to basically help

00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,960
startup and coordinated around the local

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,820
mapping and we got a lot of we learned a

00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,770
lot as well about the tagging scheming

00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,140
how locally everything is done how

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:03,890
they're tagged which really helped us

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,270
also figure out like how we should work

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,530
there versus how we were working in

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,630
Thailand because it's a little bit

00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:13,350
different and so far they've been able

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:15,650
to complete 4,800 tasks we also do a lot

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:18,120
of ground truth with the local community

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,760
so this is things like validating what's

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,540
on the ground confirming different types

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,819
of roads and tags and types of bridges

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,830
so Gulen is going to be doing an awesome

00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:31,620
talk next about the details of ground

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,750
truth so state to hear that and she'll

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,790
talk more about the experience in what

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,480
it is they were validating and how it

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,680
worked with the roads we were producing

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,820
the other thing we're focused on is

00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:47,490
crowdsourcing Road names so with

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,380
Facebook we have a ton of places data

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,930
that's already in our system we also

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,090
have a great card we have a lot of users

00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,490
that are very engaged in crowdsourcing

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,460
and answering questions and so what

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,680
we've been able to do is make calls out

00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,900
to local people and if we are if there's

00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,780
two or three places with the same street

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,640
name on the same Road we will ask back

00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,410
and have them confirm what the name is

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,400
and we'll get a confidence rating based

00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:17,400
on that in Indonesia we ran it for about

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,080
I think ten days and we're able to get a

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,930
hundred and seventy six thousand

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,490
confirmed names for streets so this is

00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:27,300
something that the local community will

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:31,440
be able to confirm and then also put

00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,970
back into OSM so how much mapping is

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,340
left so I get this comp I get this

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,380
question quite a lot is like we're gonna

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,170
map out everything and what's left the

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,360
answer is like quite a lot of data the

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,510
one constant is that there's always

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,790
change and so

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,890
a map is going to be continuously

00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,720
changed in addition to some of the

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:53,350
geometry that's missing there's always

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:56,800
going to be place movements changes you

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:58,750
know as people move so one of the data

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,240
sets that Facebook has released is the

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:04,930
population data sets these are open data

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,550
sets that you can find on season and the

00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,930
process of doing this is very similar to

00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,690
how we're extracting roads from

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,250
satellite imagery this is actually for

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,780
buildings to get a better sense of

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,110
population in areas

00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:20,950
this is examples of India Madagascar and

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:24,670
Mozambique and the images that from

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:28,480
there basically how does this help

00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:30,280
mapping so we've been able to share this

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,040
with a lot of NGOs and one of the

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,750
primary use cases across the world Bank

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,420
Red Cross Humana is here and

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,720
OpenStreetMap taught Doctors Without

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,310
Borders was being able to identify

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,960
specifically areas of population so

00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,420
instead of saying hey we need to map

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,920
this entire province we can narrow down

00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,440
on the areas that have a lot of

00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,540
buildings which makes the entire process

00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,510
more efficient when you're dealing with

00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,280
like limited time limited resources this

00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,340
is a much better way to get coordinated

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,140
faster so in the case of this this was

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,840
part of a health initiative the measles

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:08,170
and rubella initiative in southern

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Africa where we're not that you used to

00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:14,020
hearing about this maybe in the US or

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:18,480
Europe but it's quite a big deal in

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:21,550
Africa and Southeast Asia so basically

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,520
how this works says volunteers will go

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:26,200
through door-to-door talking to houses

00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,500
and making sure they're informed about

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,260
the health benefits or health

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,180
information that they need to know and

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:37,960
so the Red Cross was able to do this in

00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,940
Malawi they created 58 mapping projects

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,480
based on the population density focus

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,950
areas where people were and volunteers

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,450
around the world and this was remote

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,040
tracing were able to add a million

00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,680
building

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,920
in almost 120,000 kilometers of roads

00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,720
and this was done by about 5,000 remote

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,230
traces that probably weren't even in

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,470
Malawi and this allowed about 3,000

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:06,420
local mappers in Malawi over three days

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:08,580
to go through and talk to 100,000 houses

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,770
so they went door-to-door and were able

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:14,880
to be more efficient about how they

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:17,400
spoke to people in the face book use

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,810
case we're starting to look at ways that

00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,910
we can get quantities for what how much

00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:27,510
of the world is mapped and do it by

00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:30,750
feature type so this is an example of

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,860
the population density in Mexico and you

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,990
can see the heat map basically

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,790
everything from purple to yellow yellow

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,850
means there's more people living in that

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:40,770
area and since we have a sense of how

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,140
many people are in that area or the

00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,760
populations in that area we're wondering

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,400
if we can kind of merge this together

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,190
with some of the OSM data plus our ml

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,900
roads to see exactly how much further we

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,740
need to go to at least be somewhat

00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,300
complete so this same image with the

00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,740
satellite imagery background so you can

00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:03,030
get a little bit more context on the

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:05,460
area and we we were able to kind of do

00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:07,820
this and normalize it against a the

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:10,530
machine-learning roads we've produced so

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:14,490
basically comparing what to NOAA some

00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:16,380
versus what we've produced against the

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,540
population data and this gives us a

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,420
really good indication of very specific

00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,190
tasks that need more work for us to be

00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,740
able to say that we're completely mapped

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,300
that area and so if you are doing a

00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,360
project you could make high priority

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,190
areas or be more specific about what it

00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,850
is that was left to map and this is

00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:37,050
normalized from zero to one so zooming

00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,780
in a little bit this is what it would

00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:42,330
look like so you could see the different

00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:45,350
the same color codes of areas that

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:50,880
already have data versus what's needed

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:54,340
and the same against the imagery so what

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,030
does that look like and if we look at

00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:01,690
an example in Uganda for example this

00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,550
would be at 80% of 80% of the population

00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:07,890
being mapped this is what he would look

00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:12,570
like compared to how many people at 90%

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:17,620
this is what we end up at at 95% and

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:19,660
then finally a 99.5 percent and so you

00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,610
can see there's a much longer way to go

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,230
and so it helps us put that metric on

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,670
how many people are mapped against a

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:31,360
certain feature type much easier than

00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:33,400
other datasets so what's coming next we

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,470
want to focus on improving vandalism so

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,480
that we could you know run more checks

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,240
do them faster be more efficient and

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,170
we're always adding more features to the

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,400
open source ID and we're also looking to

00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:47,320
find ways that we can share the vector

00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,870
data more easily so when partners come

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,460
to us we're not putting it in a Dropbox

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:55,300
I think there's like a more efficient

00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:57,670
way to share that data and if you guys

00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,700
remember we showed a little bit of the

00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,830
tile and progression from the last year

00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,470
and we've had great community support

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,600
and we learnt a lot from continuously

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,820
communicating with them and learning how

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,450
to tag and were able to go through and

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:16,560
I'm going to really quickly show a video

00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:37,760
of what that progression was

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:40,130

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,920
and that's pretty much it

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,710
thanks Jesse for the interesting talk a

00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:42,620
question with respect to the validation

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:45,800
data would it be possible for you to

00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:48,260
flag change sets just like map box does

00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,730
it annoys in-car because it's not so I

00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,340
mean I assume that you fix the stuff

00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:57,350
anyway but by flagging the change sets

00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:59,000
we get a history of a person's work and

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,160
in the cases where it's just an accident

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,530
doesn't matter but if we have systemic

00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,260
vandalism makes it easier to detect if

00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:08,450
we know that the change that's so bad

00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,790
yeah absolutely so this was our plan

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,800
this was the first time we've rolled out

00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,180
or done any kind of check so our idea

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,970
was to get a sense of what's going on

00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:19,370
and then we definitely want to open that

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,050
up and flag it one of the things we had

00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:23,750
a conversation with the other people

00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:26,180
that care about validation was how can

00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,530
we put it in a more coordinated space

00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,180
and so that people don't have to go to

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,730
multiple tools to look at different

00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,960
types of validation and so our hope is

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,880
that we can plug into one of these

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,890
systems and so that it's much more

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,360
easier for users to go and see what's

00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,360
going on but yeah absolutely

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:50,150
I got the mic first and say you talked a

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,180
bit about how you're working with the

00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:55,160
community and particularly using hot to

00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:59,230
work with that in certain countries but

00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:01,400
so I'm from the UK and I'm noticing

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:04,400
OpenStreetMap in the UK now so I

00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,350
wondered us as a community as

00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,590
individuals in that community but also

00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:12,080
our local chapter and how can we help

00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,720
Facebook and support how you're using

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,790
the maps and what you're doing that's a

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,530
great question so we're always open to

00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:20,450
call it collaboration there's there's a

00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,780
lot of work to be done you can always

00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:26,660
reach out to us get on a call email

00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,630
whatever and if there's any way we can

00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,310
support each other we're completely open

00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:34,130
right now I just we're also learning

00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:35,750
what it means to have osm be on Facebook

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,370
on such a large scale were actually it

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,100
happened in the last few weeks to be

00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:42,220
very honest but you know as we all learn

00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:54,560
more we're completely open to

00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:58,840
collaborating hi hey I wonder yeah so

00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:01,430
Facebook uses various databases

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:05,000
geographical Geographic databases in its

00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:07,400
services so Bing Maps here OpenStreetMap

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,170
is there any what would be the

00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:15,110
perspective is there any long-term plan

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:17,960
to to have a single data source or would

00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:20,660
it be always like collaboration of the

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,400
data sources so I think the world map is

00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:25,070
interesting that some places are just

00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,340
better on certain places so I imagine

00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,680
you know at least for the near future

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,880
there's going to be different data

00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,490
different pieces of the data that comes

00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,640
from different places basically based on

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:39,530
what's just best at that time but we're

00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,630
very focused on OSM within Facebook

00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:44,090
we've put a lot of resources and time

00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:46,250
behind it and we like the open culture

00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:50,060
it's very similar to the culture that we

00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:52,580
have at the company so we'd like to keep

00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,030
pushing more and more resources and time

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:59,150
into

00:29:53,030 --> 00:30:01,550
son I am I understand that you do not

00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,920
publish the war data from your machine

00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:07,160
learning photo outs as open data

00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,020
directly we know that Microsoft did a

00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,630
different approach they published the

00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,480
whole data so my question to you is why

00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:17,360
do you not publish the original or

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,730
machine learning output that's open data

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,750
it actually is open so on our wiki it's

00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:25,970
it's available on upon request so you

00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:30,220
know if you just drop us a line and we'd

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,220
be happy to share it it is it is open

00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,090
sorry I also just to add to that so what

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,680
was open with am asks what we're trying

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,930
to do is open the vector data which is

00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,560
more usable and now that the ID tool

00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:48,800
helps with all the validations it's a

00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,660
much more better union of getting that

00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,640
data into OS I'm should you choose to

00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:56,090
because you're getting both the tools

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,740
and the data yes also change which are

00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:01,040
displayed on the screen have been done

00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:03,020
by your single accounts no no they've

00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,310
been done by like a group of team

00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,500
members so if you actually look at our

00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:08,300
wiki page we've mentioned everybody

00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,250
that's in our team and all of our user

00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:13,130
profiles also say they work for Facebook

00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:18,460
so you can see by chain set and by user

00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:18,460
everyone that has been adding data yep

00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,790
