The OpenStreetMap data model has served us well for the last ten years, but it has its quirky corners and some larger problems. From the missing polygon data-type, over difficult handling of updates and historical data to the processing overhead added by the need to get locations for everything from the nodes, this talk will look at current and foreseeable problems, solutions and workarounds we have found, and issues that still need addressing.
