Title: 2019: Human Mapping with Machine Data
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 1, Hörsaal Ost
Description: 
	How useful are map features automatically extracted from street-level images? Can they be trusted? These are some of the questions we tried to answer through community campaigns and student-led research in 2019. We will share some of these lessons and elicit a broader discussion on the methods that can be used to turn automatically extracted features into useful OpenStreetMap data.

In early 2019, Mapillary began generating point data representing map features that have been recognized and extracted from images, including benches, fire hydrants, bike racks, and post boxes. We worked with various Mapillary communities and users to test the value of this new form of data. In this presentation, we’ll explore two campaigns. The first was the ***#mapillary2osm*** campaign which made point data available to six communities (Antwerp, Austin, Ballerup, Kyiv, Melbourne, São Paulo) in GeoJSON files and then encouraged map edits to turn each point into nodes on OpenStreetMap. Each location was given a 25 km^2 focus area and encouraged to add these points with the hashtag ***#mapillary2osm***, with the results being shared on a public leaderboard.

The second was a project led by undergraduate students from the University of Washington’s Department of Geography. This particular project focused on a suburb of Portland, Oregon with the goal of validating and verifying Mapillary data in order to enrich OpenStreetMap. This involved measuring the difference between the OpenStreetMap data before and after the project and augmenting with Mapillary point data. 

We’ll conclude by looking at the longer term possibilities of editing OpenStreetMap with data derived using computer vision.

okay welcome everybody my name is TD we

00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:20,590
are going to have a presentation on

00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,020
human mapping with machine data by

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,730
Christophe Ironwood Eduardo from italeri

00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,800
it's going to be a 20-minute

00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,009
presentation and then five minutes for

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,529
questions thank you thank you very much

00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:34,900
from the number one mapper in Africa

00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:37,949
nice introduction so my name is Eduardo

00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,600
and I'm from mapillary this is Chris

00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:42,910
alright and today we're going to talk to

00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:48,460
you about the topic of human mapping

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:50,410
with machine data so human mapping is

00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,300
really the core of why we're all here

00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:57,160
today for this conference mapping itself

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,879
some would call it cartography but

00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,879
there's also aspects of data collection

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:07,360
design visualization data management

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,039
many more ways to paint it and in one

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,990
way you could say it's symbols that help

00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:13,030
us make sense of the world and it's

00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,920
something that goes very far back in

00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,470
human history so I have here a cave

00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:22,450
painting it's not a map but this is a

00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:24,640
very famous piece of human symbology

00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,160
that helped us just kind of represent

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,560
something more real and the map does

00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,810
something very similar for us and one of

00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,179
the ideas behind all of this is symbols

00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:38,110
like this and maps or cartography are

00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:42,119
created by humans and they're intended

00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:45,399
to be a tool that's also used by humans

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,160
humans build these maps but we also

00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,979
design them we tweak the design we test

00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,569
them we try to break them even more so

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:56,110
in the modern day when they get complex

00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:57,819
their web Maps we invent new ways of

00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,360
visualizing things we imagine new ways

00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:04,060
of using the map and we find all these

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,940
tools that help enable us to build

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:14,680
better maps or to use maps better and

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:16,150
maps come from various sources in a way

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,480
you could say all maps are built from

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,969
data in some way shape or form and the

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,560
raw uninterpreted data is the source of

00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:24,120
information

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,180
like you might see and I changed that

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,340
comment and OpenStreetMap so you can see

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,069
the sources on this one our street-level

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:36,890
imagery mapillary aerial imagery local

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:40,700
knowledge survey GPS all of these can be

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:43,680
not so meaningful on their own they take

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,680
some interpretation in order to turn

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,050
them into a map whether it's an image

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,800
from the ground an aerial image just a

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,830
GPS point it takes the human to actually

00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,880
transform that into some larger piece of

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:03,239
information so really the human serves

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,640
as the bridge between that raw data and

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,580
the information that's derived from it

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,110
and in our case that's in the form of a

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,790
map okay so we're pretty familiar with

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,200
photo mapping in the context of Open

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,810
Street Map now but just to reiterate

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,599
kind of how its evolved we're doing

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,670
dense image capture now so we're able

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,709
now with a lot of the action cameras

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,989
that are available to get up to in some

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,480
cases if you're using a dash cam five

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,630
images per second and so you can get

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,430
almost any very possible object on the

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,560
side of the road as you're driving

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,910
through or cycling or walking and so

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,769
this is kind of what we're really

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,209
pushing now is dense capture whereas in

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,519
the early days of urban street map when

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,799
you saw people using photos in kind of

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,959
using DSLR cameras that were taking one

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,340
photo of a garbage truck or a garbage

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,079
can rather moving to the next scene

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,739
taking another photo now it's about

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,209
doing a field survey and then computers

00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,769
deriving a lot of data and then also

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,329
making that data available which we'll

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,250
talk about in a second so you've got

00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:06,410
that geo tagged image you've got a time

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,410
stamp and they can compare across time

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,180
so in terms of the computer vision

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,859
that's going on behind the scenes so the

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,739
algorithms are detecting are using

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,209
training data that's collected well

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,820
we've actually manually manually

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,510
annotating images and that's done by

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,030
humans and then we are able to scale

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,740
this once we actually have humans doing

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,510
verifications which we'll talk about in

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,560
a second as well so if you look at

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,560
what's going on behind the scenes

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,320
so this is a fire hydrant detected

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,700
across three different images actually

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,750
in this case seven different images and

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,460
it shows you which images have been

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,470
detected we're actually able to

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,820
triangulate that using a 3d

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,450
reconstruction that's taking place

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,580
behind the scenes so this is the PI

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,200
hydrant viewed within mapillary you can

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,600
see other segmentation so there's light

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,190
poles that have been segmented traffic

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,830
signs as well and many images of

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,960
streetlight and we're able to do this

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,520
because of that 3d reconstruction and so

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,140
we're talking earlier about dense

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,680
imagery the more dense imagery you have

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,090
the better this 3d reconstruction and

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,950
this is very fast gift but that equates

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:16,450
to 3d points on the mountain so if we

00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,150
look back at like how map Larese been

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,460
involved with Open Street Map we had a

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,350
traffic sign layer available for a long

00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,180
time this was one of the first things we

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,450
did as far as making computer vision

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,190
available for Open Street Map and then

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,550
shortly after that it was available in

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,140
Joslin but the problem was we had map

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,760
features we had map features for a while

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,320
but they weren't actually available in

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,150
OpenStreetMap so we had like traffic

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,100
signs but not necessarily fire hydrants

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,770
that we detected so we started to ask

00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,660
ourselves how can we make this data

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,090
available what what data is useful for

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,410
the community what data is not and this

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,970
was partly because we had a huge up

00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,230
swell of like community interest in

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,790
improving our data when there were

00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,650
traffic signs that weren't detected

00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,680
correctly they wanted to be able to help

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:04,030
us and improve that and improve the the

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,560
recall rate of those signs so earlier

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,050
this year we ran a project called map

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,300
Lurie to osm there's a very like hacky

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,800
project but the idea behind it was to

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,290
take some of this data that we had and

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,790
make it available to OpenStreetMap we

00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,350
didn't do it in a very elegant way we

00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,390
thought we'd just do it as an experiment

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,010
at first and so what we did was chose

00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,080
five cities that had pretty decent

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:25,780
coverage in a pretty strong community so

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,610
that was Austin in Texas Balor up in

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,910
Denmark we had Melbourne in Australia

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,830
South Paulo and Kiev and we downloaded

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,340
data sets of things like crosswalks

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,500
streetlights benches and we made that

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,330
available as just a Google Drive form

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,550
that they could download and then load

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,380
into Open Street Map as a geo Jason so

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,790
25 square kilometers of interest and

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,210
three different types of out features

00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:51,560
and then we tracked what

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:53,419
add it to the map wrong computer okay

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,800
great so this is what it looks like I

00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:58,669
don't know if you've hands up if you've

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,030
used a GI Jason file in ID editor or

00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:03,889
Jocelyn so it's it's kind of handy but

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,050
it's not interactive so when you click

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,960
on those pink squares nothing happens

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,789
this is showing the 3d the actual

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,580
location of that sign as we've estimated

00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:14,960
it to be but you don't know here which

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,880
image it's been detected so you might

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,410
need to click around again a lot to

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,389
actually find it so not the most elegant

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,250
solution but this was just step one and

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,490
we found in this particular case that

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,990
benches were the most useful object and

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,180
one interesting finding was the benches

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,030
identified in Ukraine were a lot more

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,070
accurate than benches derived in Austin

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,509
Texas so for whatever reason our

00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:43,849
algorithms are better in Ukraine for

00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:45,590
benches so in terms of the feedback that

00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:48,620
we've got from the data not all the

00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,449
icons are intuitive so we have a suite

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,699
of icons that correspond to the

00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:54,169
different points and to make mapping

00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,490
kind of as efficient as possible someone

00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,229
needs to know when they're looking at

00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,729
say 50 different points that that's a

00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:00,830
street light that's a garbage bin I

00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,000
don't know if you've seen the icons of

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,199
mouth or comm Chris is going to show

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,940
them later but it's not always intuitive

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,419
what they are so that's one thing we can

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:10,310
improve on the lat/long varies a lot so

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:14,240
in downtown areas like Melbourne the

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:16,099
estimation of of a point can be far off

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,050
because the actual GPS of the smart

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:20,990
phone capturing it is all wild and all

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,430
over the place and the last feedback I

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,690
don't know if you met Henry yesterday if

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,990
you're at the hot summit but he was

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,280
using Mallory in Kampala Uganda and he

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,690
was telling us that a lot of the object

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,300
classes that we have things like

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:35,450
crosswalks and benches they're not

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,770
actually set up in mind with Uganda in

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,930
mind so that's one thing we're trying to

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,820
do is get more training data from places

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,289
like Kampala and then that will probably

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,959
change that scenario and we can also add

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,100
new object classes like windows which

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,440
are actually very important for

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:53,089
humanitarian purposes and understanding

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:55,640
earthquake resilience so a similar

00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:57,110
project we worked on this year was with

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,150
four students from the University of

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:03,000
Washington in Seattle in the US

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,220
and we decided that we wanted to analyze

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,610
an area that had dense mapillary

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,590
imagery and therefore pretty dense data

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:13,350
so we picked a section of Portland

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:16,770
Oregon known as a Perl district so it's

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:19,650
a nice quadrant of the town and what we

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:22,410
wanted to do was take the data that map

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,810
ler had detected and compare it to what

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:28,860
was already on OS m to see what matched

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:30,660
up as well as see what was valid data

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,960
that could be added to OS m and improve

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:37,980
it and finally see what data was either

00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,810
a false negative or just a duplicate

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,520
that wasn't actually useful in improving

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:46,200
the map so the specific project was

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,160
called verifying map boy Point features

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,720
and improving Open Street Map data and

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,400
the total number of points that came out

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,750
of mapillary were just over two thousand

00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:00,710
and about 1200 of these were actually

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:04,080
visible in the photos the other 900 were

00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,760
some combination of either too small or

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,980
blurred to be visible at least to the

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,780
human eye which sometimes means it might

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,210
still be there it's just not easy to

00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:15,780
identify other times it was a false

00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:17,390
classification so that rate would be

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,370
about 59%

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,080
were brought onto the next stage of

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,810
actually analyzing for adding to the map

00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:29,630
and so that cut down by a little less

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:32,700
than half to 452 points added to OS M so

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,530
the main classes you can see here very

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,740
similar to ones that I'd mentioned

00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,870
previously as we had benches crosswalks

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,360
trash bins fire hydrants and bicycle

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:45,230
racks these we knew from previous tests

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,220
were some of the more accurate

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,550
classifications so we're not talking

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,750
about spatial position accuracy but just

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:55,350
having an algorithm find this in an

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,870
image and so these ones we selected

00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,940
specifically to keep the task small

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,420
allow them to evaluate this over the

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,490
course of about six weeks and also they

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:09,110
were ones that translated very well into

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,110
matching tags in OpenStreetMap

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,540
so we found quite a few of them had

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,029
issues with false positives

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,790
benches for example when you're a

00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:22,339
machine and not a human that thinks as

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,660
critically as we do you can classify it

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:27,230
often very the same as things like

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,720
guardrails cafe chairs and tables like

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,100
all these technically you'd give the

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,589
Machine some leeway that looks like a

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,970
bench but it's really not so it wasn't

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:37,189
useful and actually adding to the map

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,019
and wastebaskets

00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:42,790
very similar a lot of confusion with

00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:45,649
similar shaped objects bicycle racks

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:48,110
just imagine what one looks like in the

00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,790
city or town where you live and it's

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,019
probably completely different if you

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,209
travel somewhere a few hours away

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:55,310
there's no standardization of these

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:56,540
visually even though we have a standard

00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,939
tag for it in OpenStreetMap

00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,040
so again it can be confused with other

00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:04,189
things that are similar shapes handrails

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,170
on stairs going into buildings often was

00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:08,300
classified as a bike rack and sometimes

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,610
even had a bicycle attached to it so

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,769
this can this can be how the machine

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:15,800
thinks and we have to definitely have

00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:19,250
some some oversight on this and

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,319
crosswalks as well just white light in

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,290
the photo or other pavement markings a

00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:26,180
lot of these can cause issues so they

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,759
did a breakdown of the total detection

00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,860
rate but you can see here from the

00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:33,079
percentages just to sift through it the

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,329
bicycle racks actually perform pretty

00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:38,389
well overall despite a few confusing

00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:40,819
ones fire hydrants also are very

00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:45,170
consistently good and crosswalks also

00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:46,970
we're pretty useful so what we're really

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,160
interested in gleaning from this was

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,420
what the drawbacks are what our data is

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,160
failing to do and where we can improve

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,949
we already see there's quite a few

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,100
strengths and that's what we wanted to

00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:00,199
focus on for getting that data into OS m

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:03,410
but we found it can be difficult to

00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:05,269
interpret the data especially if you're

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,509
pulling it from an API just trying to

00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:10,069
get goj saans and limited quantities you

00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:12,259
need to have a good way to import that

00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:14,569
into Open Street Map so in our API you

00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:16,970
put in a bounding box choose a square on

00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:18,889
the map you'll get the data but you need

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,870
to filter it out there's some data

00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:22,040
classes aren't relevant things that Open

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,670
Street Map doesn't have a

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,529
for like a paint marking so it becomes a

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:31,100
lot of work just to get started before

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:32,509
you even in the editor and finally once

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,149
you're in the editor you're seeing that

00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:36,709
something is said to be detected as a

00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,630
point in the map you can't find it in

00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,100
the image so it's helpful if you can

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,690
actually go through the imagery first

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,720
and verify that it's really there or

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:47,060
validate that it's what it says it is so

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,060
there's there was a lack of workflow for

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,980
this and so it really boiled down to how

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,319
can we make this workflow exist

00:13:51,980 --> 00:14:00,769
how can you ingest this type of data

00:13:54,319 --> 00:14:04,730
into osm so a next experiment that came

00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:07,819
up was some kind of data overlay we knew

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:10,100
that we wanted to take certain point

00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:12,889
features and put them on the map and we

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,350
wanted to have act in the way of a tile

00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:17,899
layer if you're familiar with mapillary

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,329
from recent years on Open Street Map

00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,940
you'll see traffic sign layer available

00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:24,620
an ID and jostle and you can overlay it

00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,720
so you can find something like a speed

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,699
limit you'll know which road is adjacent

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,889
to it and you can go ahead and add that

00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:35,600
max speed as an attribute of the road

00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:38,230
but we wanted to find a similar process

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,870
for point features beyond traffic signs

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,329
so we had a sprite system created so a

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,910
set of icons and we were able to

00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:48,079
associate these with the points and see

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,660
what it looked like when you brought it

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,569
in as a layer an ID we were to filter

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,819
out for just a few classes and we made

00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:57,980
it so similar to our traffic signs if

00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:59,690
you click the icon it'll pull up images

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,170
that are facing toward that measuring

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:05,750
off the camera angle and it allows the

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,459
mapper to then analyze where that data

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,459
is located like a traffic light and an

00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:12,889
intersection inspect the images verify

00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,810
exactly what it is and then use their

00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:18,110
knowledge of osm and the tagging system

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:20,540
to go ahead and add it to the map and we

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,990
also filter out images or points that

00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,850
don't appear in at least three images so

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,860
if even if it's only two images we don't

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,899
consider that dense enough so this is a

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,320
really important reason to have lots of

00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:34,840
images in one area and

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,430
that really helps give evidence that the

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:43,330
thing actually exists so we ran a quick

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:45,160
test with this send it to a few users so

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,950
one user in Japan provided very good

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,990
feedback you can see the map of the area

00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,250
he was looking at here and the first

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,130
thing he said is I don't know what these

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,540
icons mean and these actually seem a

00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,910
little more intuitive when you see them

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,280
larger but on a small screen there's

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,450
just a lot of details so we said okay

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,070
well we need to have some more

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,530
information about what exactly you're

00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:09,670
seeing on the map I need to add that as

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:12,670
a map key somewhere it was also clear

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:15,580
that like a lot of the data positioning

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:18,310
was affected by the quality of the GPS

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,990
so it was offset a lot of false

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,670
negatives and of course there was no

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:25,270
compendium of what actual data is

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:28,050
available so we came up with this slide

00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:30,700
right here just to make a concise list

00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:33,790
this is one will tweet out later as well

00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:36,190
it just gives you an idea of what you

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,730
can get on the map and what the icons

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,990
look like and we find this is a huge

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,250
huge aid for people that want to know

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:48,010
what they're looking at when they

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:49,660
overlay that layer so we have this

00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:52,300
available in a few test regions right

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,960
now so you can see the names of the

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,300
regions here including Heidelberg we did

00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,030
some tests with users specifically just

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,760
outside of Munich and freising in a

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:05,560
small area of Tokyo and we also enabled

00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,949
the data and follow-up which is outside

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,900
of Copenhagen and then mostly on my end

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,240
I was doing specific tests just looking

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,640
at the island of Madeira and Portugal

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,560
the Galapagos Island where we did a

00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,470
collaboration with a student mapping

00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,660
project as well as Zanzibar where we had

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,300
met with the Zanzibar mapping Institute

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:28,990
last year and Ed and I had the chance to

00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,060
capture a lot of imagery in that area so

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,690
you can test it out it's on the preview

00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:37,710
editor for osm ID so there's a URL at

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:40,450
the top just tiny dot CC / map LOI test

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,450
and this will allow you to see under the

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:47,190
mapillary section of map data the map

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,190
features layer

00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:54,100
and you'll see in red there it says

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:56,019
request data if you click that it's

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,850
going to bring up a form so just a quick

00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:59,620
look at it you're gonna draw a shape on

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,149
the map where you want the data we ask

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,059
that you keep it small so it's very

00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:05,409
specific we wouldn't expect you to be

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:10,090
able to test out something like the

00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:11,769
entire country of Sweden so we will

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,389
provide it to that shape and we just ask

00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:17,110
a little bit about who you are and what

00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:19,899
you're working on with it okay so that

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:22,000
ties in nicely to verification projects

00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:23,950
so one of the drawbacks that you saw on

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,539
the slide earlier was that often there

00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,250
are false positives which means there's

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:30,130
an object that mapillary has said is

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,570
there and it's not actually there and so

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,700
that's frustrating for OpenStreetMap as

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,710
if they were actually downloading this

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,080
data and then looking at it in ID editor

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,970
and only 50% of the fire hydrants they

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,399
click on actually have a fire hydrant

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,889
there and that's where the community

00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:47,049
comes in earlier this year we ran a

00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:49,389
verification campaign where I think we

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:51,669
had about maybe Lindsey can correct me

00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:54,549
if I'm wrong with about 50,000

00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:55,840
verifications that took place and now

00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:59,200
we're actually going for 1 million

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,429
verification so what this means is we we

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,970
have a game where we have a set of

00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:05,559
classes so he you can see the different

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,649
kind of classes that we create projects

00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:10,600
for things like birds ground animals

00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:12,519
crosswalks planes and if you're

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,870
wondering like why things like birds and

00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:16,600
ground animals come up when they're not

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,250
related to OpenStreetMap that's also

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,620
helping us to remove things that aren't

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,950
relevant so crosswalks is one example

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:26,860
and what it looks like when it comes up

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,389
is just a very simple image where you

00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,549
see the bounding box where we think this

00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:32,529
object is located you can either give it

00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:35,080
a thumbs up if it's correct thumbs down

00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:36,940
if it's not and you can skip through

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,340
them if you're unsure and this goes into

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,830
a leaderboard and so what we're doing is

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,080
40 object classes you can participate in

00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,210
the ones that interest you and for the

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,250
top three the people who once we reach 1

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,929
million have had the most verifications

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,720
they'll receive one of these three

00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:55,899
prizes so we're aiming for October six

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,519
which is not too far away but given the

00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:59,570
previous kind of feedback that we've had

00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,330
on this change we think it's possible

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:04,609
but I think the prizes should be pretty

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:07,070
enticing and we've made it now so that

00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:08,869
when you actually verify it's not just

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,429
you clicking yes or no you actually have

00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:11,840
to have someone else confirm it in the

00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:14,029
same way that you did so you can't just

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,070
cheat the system and thumbs down to

00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:17,450
everything or thumbs up and you can't

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,639
even have someone else like you know

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,440
your friend going through and pressing

00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:22,700
the same as you are because we'll be

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,049
scanning for that as well so we're

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,029
actually trying to create quality data

00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,129
we don't want to be dumping bad data

00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:31,489
into OpenStreetMap but if there is an

00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:33,559
area of interest to you that you'd like

00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:35,690
to improve this is how you do it and so

00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,489
I guess the final point if you

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,409
participate in this it's improving in

00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:41,989
two ways one it's removing false

00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:43,639
positives so if there is you know you're

00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:45,979
trying to add bike racks in your city

00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:47,659
and Antwerp you can go through you can

00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:49,549
create a verification project you can

00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:50,929
remove all the false bike racks that

00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,059
have been detected and then you'll have

00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:54,950
a clean data set for OpenStreetMap the

00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:56,869
second thing is it helps us once we

00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,789
retrain our algorithms to improve the

00:20:56,869 --> 00:21:00,440
recall for that object class and so

00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:02,299
maybe you do it in Antwerp but maybe

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,090
someone else does it in Uganda and then

00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:07,309
we'll have a global verifications data

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,840
set so that we can identify what a bike

00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:15,409
rack looks in many different scenarios

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:18,019
across the world scooter so the last

00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:19,700
thing that we want to mention so we wrap

00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:21,739
up pretty quickly now but it's a global

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,479
verification project I've just mentioned

00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:25,309
I think the other thing is we're really

00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:27,529
emphasizing dense capture now so we have

00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:29,299
a series of capture tools which we'll be

00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:31,099
speaking it about over the next few days

00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:32,659
which is where if you have a team you're

00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:33,139
trying to divide up where you're each

00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:35,090
going

00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:36,649
you can assign tasks if you like the hot

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,710
tasking manager but for street-level

00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:41,450
imagery the other thing is we have this

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,249
huge amount of data available from each

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,989
image but what is relevant so we'd love

00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:46,759
to have this conversation with you about

00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:48,649
what map features you think a useful for

00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:50,090
Open Street Map and which ones aren't if

00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:51,710
there are new features you'd like to

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:55,220
have in please let us know it as well

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:57,559
and lastly before we get to questions we

00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,659
have a raffle that will be taking place

00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,789
tomorrow in a bird's feathers session

00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:03,229
yet to be announced but follow us on

00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:07,070
Twitter where we will announce that and

00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:09,320
we'll be giving away a GoPro and Harry

00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,720
from hot Indonesia was the lucky winner

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,889
yesterday and you have to be there to

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,200
collect the prize I think there was

00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:15,149
three

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,250
for people who missed out because they

00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:19,769
weren't there but hehe showed up and say

00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,090
he received the prize so please do come

00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:22,500
along to the birds of feather session

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,350
we'll talk about street level imagery

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,580
and how we're all using it so thanks for

00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,050
coming to the session I think we'll

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:36,210
throw it over to questions now

00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:39,249
[Applause]

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:44,740
the enlightening presentation and

00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:47,080
increase and I think you have moved way

00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:50,259
into the questions time I will give you

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,639
only two minutes okay yeah quick

00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:55,019
questions and then you can find us

00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:55,019
outside as well we're always available

00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:02,340
hello you were complaining about bad GPS

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:05,350
position and Aria and any efforts of

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,600
improving that but by just looking at

00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,759
the images from that you can actually

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,499
determine the position where race

00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,419
through the city yeah we're doing that

00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:15,369
with the 3d reconstruction so we're

00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:17,230
actually trying to realign the GPS

00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:19,629
positions but you don't see that on the

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,220
when you look at the sequences on map or

00:23:19,629 --> 00:23:23,649
comm that's just showing whatever your

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,350
phone recorded but with the objects

00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:30,389
we're actually trying to improve the 3d

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,389
reconstruction so we are doing that

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,350
[Music]

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,940
reattachment one more okay it looks like

00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,279
there are no more questions

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,260
but if you don't have any questions they

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,480
are they have the green pin so you can

00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:55,429
catch them anyway and ask thank you

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,429
everybody for attending okay thank you

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,680
