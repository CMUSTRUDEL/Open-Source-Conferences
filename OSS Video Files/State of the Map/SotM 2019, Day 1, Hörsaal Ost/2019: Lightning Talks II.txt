## OpenStreetMap intrinsic quality assessment using “Is OSM up-to-date?” web application 
Marco Minghini and Francesco Frassinelli
Approaches to analyze OpenStreetMap (OSM) intrinsically, i.e. based on the history of data, have become an established way to achieve a wide range of final goals, most importantly to study its quality. Started in 2017, “Is OSM up-to-date?” is an open source web application licensed under AGPL and mainly written in Python. It can be also run in the command line or inside a Docker container. The target beneficiaries of the software are OSM users and communities, who need to assess the quality of data in a given area to decide whether to use it or not as well as where mapping efforts should be best directed, and OSM researchers and scholars, who can use it as a tool to help in their OSM quality studies. The project has a dedicated wiki page (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Is_OSM_up-to-date), source code is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate) and a demo is available at https://is-osm-uptodate.frafra.eu. Using the OSM API, the web application generates history-based, quality-oriented visualizations of OSM nodes and ways having at least one tag for any rectangular user-selected region. Such visualizations (on top of a grayscale OSM basemap) are available for the following criteria: date of creation, date of last edit, number of versions, number of different contributors who edited that node or way, and frequency of update. When an OSM node or way is clicked, a popup shows its values for the previously mentioned criteria as well as the list of currently available tags and the links to the OSM iD editor (in edit mode on that node or way), history and details of that node or way (both linked to the OSM website). A number of additional features to further improve the analysis of quality is currently planned (see https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate/labels/enhancement).

## Deriviste - Click and Go Photo Mapping
Christopher Beddow
There are many OSM editing tools, but only one that allows the user to click inside a Mapillary image to add new data to the map. Richard Fairhurst's Deriviste tool was a quick experiment that proved this was possible, but it's important to ask more questions. How useful is the tool? How accurate and precise is it? How can it be improved?

## Fifty states in 12 years and five minutes
Minh Nguyễn
A whirlwind historical tour of the OpenStreetMap project in the United States.

## "MAPAbabae": Using OSM as a Tool for Mapping with Women and For Women
Andi Tabinas, Arnalie Vicario
We would like to share how we, as part of the Social Welfare and Development agency of the Philippines (DSWD), have utilized OSM to have a collaborative and gender-inclusive approach of mapping points of interests catering to women.

## Reverse Geocoding Is Not Simple
Ilya Zverev
Having seen a dozen of different geocoders, I did not expect to find myself writing another one. But here I am, tasked with making a reverse geocoder better than the industry-standard Nominatim. Turns out it is a fun and not so straightforward task. Let’s see what can go wrong.

	00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,600
welcome to the lightning talks to

00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,519
session we have five talks to get

00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,980
through in 30 minutes so we're going to

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,550
start

00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,189
and see how this goes our speakers will

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,259
have five minutes to share their work so

00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:25,060
we're gonna kick this off with Marco

00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:27,070
Ming Guinea talking about intrinsic

00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:35,020
quality assessment and OpenStreetMap so

00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:36,550
let's give them a good afternoon

00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,050
everyone yes my name is Mark coming

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,390
Jeannie will give you this lightning

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,969
talk on the ESO sm up-to-date web

00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,250
application co-author with francesco

00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:47,020
frissina le first of all is awesome

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:51,580
up-to-date is a software is open source

00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:53,020
under the a GPL license and it performs

00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,570
so-called the intrinsic quality

00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,630
assessment of OpenStreetMap by analyzing

00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,550
the history of OS m notes and ways it

00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,460
addresses the needs of researchers of

00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:06,040
users contributors communities who wants

00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,290
to have a quick visual but intuitive

00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,540
idea of the possible quality of the data

00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,280
there are some links here the links to

00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,259
the repository the links to the wiki

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,450
page there's a web front-end that you

00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:18,430
can use to play with the software and a

00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,369
docker container for quick deployment

00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,649
this is the architecture very quickly

00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:26,829
the backend is written in Python free it

00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:28,990
fetches data using the OSM api it

00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:31,179
converts data into an SQLite database

00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,789
and thanks to the JSON one extension of

00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:36,459
SQLite it basically produces a valid geo

00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:40,329
JSON that is then exposed through a REST

00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:42,039
API using hug the front-end can be

00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:44,109
either web application if you want to

00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:45,729
run your analysis online or a

00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:47,340
command-line interface if you want to

00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:50,950
download the data and perform some

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,560
additional analysis as you will see in a

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,079
minute for each node and way in a user

00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,270
selected area the software computes some

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,729
history based parameters in particular

00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,099
the date of creation the date of last

00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,109
edit the number of versions the number

00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:07,359
of different contributors who edited

00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,160
each node away and the frequency of

00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,520
update so this for each node and way

00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,410
with some hypothesis so we consider only

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,349
the notes and ways having at least one

00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,940
tag and we consider a new version of

00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:21,910
each nor the way when the reason you

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,650
change that so even if many tags are

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,890
added in a single change that this is

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,020
one

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,430
new version this is how the web

00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,550
application looks like so basically

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,200
there's gray oh it's an base map but you

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,480
can increase the color of the base map

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,490
using this bar there's a search box here

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,930
based on dominating here you have to

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,670
select the parameter you want to

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,280
investigate this is the date of creation

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,200
or first edit here you select if you

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,660
want to analyze north ways or both and

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,640
then you press this patch data button to

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,280
get this color visualization so this is

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,560
the date of creation in red we have the

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,320
way is created less recently in blue

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,239
those created more recently let's see

00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,220
another parameter so this is the city

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,750
center of Milan if you are at state of

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,150
the map 2018 you should know this area

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,489
very well we are looking at the date of

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,160
last edit so the last update and you can

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,940
see that most of the nodes and ways here

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,680
are blue which means very well update of

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,320
the data which might suggest good

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,390
quality this is the Louvre museum in

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,580
Paris and we are looking at the number

00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,200
of versions or revisions existing for

00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,350
our same ways you can see that for most

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,880
of them one so they are red so only one

00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,190
version existing of course there are

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,079
exceptions here if you click on

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,340
something you have a pop-up showing you

00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,280
the values of this five parameters

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,160
showing you the tags the links to the ID

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,110
editor to the wiki and so on this is the

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,970
number of different contributors who

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,519
edited the notes in the area of

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,620
Alexanderplatz in berlin again you see

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,890
that for most of them you have exactly

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,870
one different person but of course there

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,610
are exceptions finally this is the

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,370
update frequency which is also something

00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,920
quite interesting to analyze again in a

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,170
quality idea the higher the frequency of

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,760
AB the ID higher might be the quality so

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,170
what is the message here the message is

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,930
by testing all these five parameters

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,730
together you can get an overall idea of

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,680
the quality of the data in your area and

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:17,200
this might be super useful if you need

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:19,000
to quickly make or choose when where to

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,500
make edits or if you need to use the

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,120
data or if you need for example where to

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,910
organize a mapping party to update the

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,190
data I as I said you can also use the

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,720
software through the common line if you

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,460
need for example to download the data

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,289
and make some additional analysis later

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,880
on you have just used this Python

00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,180
function you give the bounding box in

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,889
input and you get

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,800
J'son including all the notes and the

00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:43,100
ways in the bounding box with clearly

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,070
all the parameters as attributes of the

00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,229
geo jason if you want to know more of

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,729
course I had to be very quick but you

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:52,580
can have a look at this paper published

00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:55,160
exactly one week ago there are a number

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,900
of features that we want to add now to

00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,910
the software so if you are interested to

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,500
contribute of course you are more than

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,590
welcome just that a look at the issue

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,789
tracker or just contact us directly

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,789
let's see Thanks

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,320
[Music]

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,070
Thank You Marco we're gonna hold all the

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,930
questions until the end next we have

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,930
Chris at mapillary

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,629
that's okay

00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,680
hello my name is Chris Beto I'm

00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,600
solutions engineer at mapillary and I'm

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,770
here to talk to you today about Dara V

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:08,360
stay click and go photo mapping a quick

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:09,860
introduction to this this tool first and

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,430
foremost you can call it a proof of

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,690
concept the idea was to create data from

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,740
images it's an open source project

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,870
created by Richard Fairhurst

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,210
so to quote him says patches are lovely

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,680
please send patches so we're looking for

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,350
more people to collaborate on the

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:31,790
development there's four contributors so

00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:33,590
far and it's not really an editor for OS

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,660
M because you can't edit things that

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:39,320
exist already but it's more of a creator

00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,210
so you can create new data we also like

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,260
to think of as an opportunity to explore

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:49,100
a new concept of edit our enriching

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,590
OpenStreetMap from photos so when you

00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:55,190
first visit the website you're gonna

00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:57,710
find this screen for the Devi State web

00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,960
creator and you'll see a world map

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,640
you'll see edit tags in the bottom right

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,780
search for tags and a set of

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:08,090
instructions you can also in the top

00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,830
right turn on the layer switcher the

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,650
layers literature will let you choose

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:16,010
some satellite layers as well as the OSM

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:18,350
carto style and you can click to turn

00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,120
map layer layer on and off so the

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,860
mapillary coverage will appear in green

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,160
to show you where the images exist as a

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,290
guide so when you zoom into your area

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,530
you can also use the search tool at the

00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,960
top right to zoom in you'll be able to

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:36,590
then click on the green and a photo

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,230
appears and in this photo you have a red

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:43,040
indicator it shows you where your mouse

00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:45,950
is hovering in the image and you'll also

00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,620
see as we see on the left a red line

00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,420
with a dot and that line shows you the

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,000
angle you're facing in the camera and

00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:56,030
the dot shows you exactly where on the

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,850
map your mouse approximately corresponds

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,760
to in the image also when you zoom in

00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:03,470
the green mapillary tiles disappear this

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,849
is because we were using a raster tile

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,240
for performance

00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:09,860
and this right now is sort of a bug but

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,779
I considered a feature because it lets

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,219
you see the ground more clearly without

00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:17,389
the green overlay so in this instance we

00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:20,449
found a streetlight

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:22,520
so once you've double clicked either on

00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:25,009
the map or you can double click in the

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,839
image then a point appears in both the

00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:29,659
map and the image they correspond with

00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,520
one another so we can see that in this

00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:34,219
image we have double clicked on a street

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,959
lamp and it appears in pretty much the

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:39,259
right location on the right side of the

00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:42,589
road on the map as well so so far we're

00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:44,750
succeeding at creating this data next

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:47,389
you can search for the tag you want so I

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,310
search for street lamp and you'll select

00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:52,069
that one and it appears under edit tags

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,690
if you had something else to add maybe

00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:56,149
you're creating a restaurant then you

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,339
can also type in other tags such as the

00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:03,079
name or the operator of the opening

00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:05,269
hours so what's really important

00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:07,370
besides how this tool currently

00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:07,899
functions is what we could possibly do

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,699
with it

00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:12,259
so one of the most important things I

00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:14,959
want to look into is putting vector

00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:16,610
tiles into this tool the vector tiles

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,829
mean that we would tile the mapillary

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,319
imagery and this gives you a little more

00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:23,839
functionality like filtering down the

00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:26,149
imagery by date or maybe by user names

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,189
so if you only want your images and from

00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,569
August and you want to create data from

00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:32,149
those then this is helpful

00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:35,839
you could also show only 360 images or

00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:37,310
you can show all images some suggestions

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,139
have come through such as saving the

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,660
last tag you used right now you have to

00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:43,639
re-enter streetlamp each time and be

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,819
ideal if it's just Auto suggests this to

00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,860
you and when you submit the data ask for

00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:51,220
a change set comment so we'd also look

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,019
at persisting that from your last one

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,579
it's been suggested to do localization

00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:57,170
and translation so this is a great way

00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:59,180
to contribute once we're able to set

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,790
that up so you can have it in your local

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,380
language another is to use computer

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,269
vision detection zazz you see in this

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,829
image it'll suggest where you can look

00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:10,189
for something like a crosswalk or a

00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:12,949
traffic light we want to make oh s M

00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:15,740
more compatible with with logging in

00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:18,199
through the OAuth and finally some other

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,700
items like adding notes something like

00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:22,690
fix me

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:25,810
or doing a line-drawing mode so overall

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,370
you can view the app at the top link the

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,050
bottom link is the github where you can

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,540
get involved with development or submit

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,010
an issue as a suggestion you can also

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,560
tweet me on Twitter if you have ideas

00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,360
about this or send me an email so we'd

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,250
love to see more people get involved and

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,200
please consider trying to use this you

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,030
know your own workflows and come up with

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,270
new ideas for what kind of challenges it

00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:49,860
can solve thank you

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:53,610
[Music]

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,610
[Applause]

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,590
[Applause]

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:36,170
okay next we have men to take us on a

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:39,290
tour of 50 states twelve years and five

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,420
minutes all right hi everyone I'm

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,950
mingwan from California most of the

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,230
talks at this conference are about the

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,720
present or even the future this talk is

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,340
actually about the past sorry I'm going

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,990
to squeeze 12 years of history into a

00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,970
handful of slides to give you a basic

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:58,760
understanding how how OpenStreetMap has

00:11:52,970 --> 00:12:00,830
developed in the u.s. from the beginning

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,690
volunteers and corporations alike has

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,060
tried to solve a key problem how to

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:08,240
scale OpenStreetMaps traditional mapping

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:11,060
techniques to such a vast country that

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,490
has dinah dense dynamic cities as well

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,650
as vast rural areas with few potential

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,720
contributors just to put things in

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,220
perspective the official unit of

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,610
distance measurement in the u.s. is not

00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,350
actually miles it's ours so when I

00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,330
started mapping over eleven years ago

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,600
the nearest mapper was three hours away

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:33,350
from from me by car I don't know how

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,870
many miles that was so practically

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,850
speaking the US community began in 2007

00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,300
with the first permanent import of roads

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,260
from the tiger and massagist datasets

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,270
imports have played in out straw

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,680
outsides roll in the US as you can see

00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:50,480
going from blank to seemingly filled in

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,100
so those imports kicked off years of

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,200
large-scale cleanup efforts that that

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,870
continued to this day

00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,490
so you can see here just such as some of

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,630
the problems that we've that we continue

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:05,330
to deal with so Tiger data from the

00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,590
Census Bureau was was messy it was

00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,940
really suitable like it was so it's

00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,920
suitable for display at low zoom levels

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,350
but not at higher zoom levels and let

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,110
alone being useful for routing so

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,270
community members manually cleaned up

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,970
these misaligned in some cases purely

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,730
fictitious roads and boundaries mostly

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,290
from the comfort of armchairs

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,090
subsequently data on waterways

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,730
boundaries and buildings were imported

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,140
from numerous other sources mostly from

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,190
the federal government to give the map a

00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,190
higher quality baseline

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,470
over the years map improvement efforts

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,300
have become more localized mostly focus

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,190
at the county level so below the state

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,810
level with local communities becoming

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,600
more involved in all steps of the import

00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,490
process

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,259
there have been city county and state

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,389
level imports in 37 states and

00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:55,029
territories everywhere from Alaska to

00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:56,380
Hawaii Maine to Puerto Rico with a

00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:58,319
couple of notable exceptions in large

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,970
cities like Los Angeles in New York

00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:03,160
these imports have been planned proposed

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,459
and carried out mostly by by volunteers

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,110
almost entirely by volunteers so this is

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:10,600
like a really yeah it really

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,029
volunteer-driven part of the u.s.

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,130
community building imports are the most

00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:17,290
popular kind of import but from this map

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,519
of buildings normalized by state

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:23,829
population you can see that we still

00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:25,810
have a long way to go armchair mapping

00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:27,670
has also played a large role in the

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,680
projects development

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,209
besides Tiger cleanup a small number of

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,040
enthusiasts relatively small number of

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:35,620
enthusiasts have built and maintained

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,810
massive networks of not just the road

00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,350
network but also road routes cycling

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,610
facilities and rail infrastructure

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,750
they've also established relationships

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,360
with government and community

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,519
organizations that result in a more

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,230
well-rounded map and of course there's a

00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:54,939
much larger group of more casual

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:57,279
contributors the story of osm in the

00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:59,380
u.s. is really one a variety one can't

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,449
talk about just imports or just armchair

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,970
mapping manually or just field serving

00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:05,439
in isolation if you leave out any of

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,790
these methods this is what the vast

00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:09,279
majority of the map ends up looking like

00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:11,939
in the u.s. rest assure I did at

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,939
attribution

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,029
on an organizational note OpenStreetMap

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,830
us was incorporated in 2010 to support

00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:23,339
the project's development and put on the

00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:25,960
state of the map us conference annually

00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,580
technology companies and university have

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,589
also provided various kinds of support

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,360
to the project as well

00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:32,860
despite this support in-person meetups

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,930
and mapping parties have always been

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,580
relatively rare in the u.s. even as they

00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,740
are hallmarks of OpenStreetMap in other

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,089
countries but slowly communities are

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,089
popping up across the u.s. instant

00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,980
surprising places we need volunteers or

00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,000
some US and corporate partners to step

00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,800
up and harness these budding

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,810
opportunities in various parts of the US

00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,200
to build a solid foundation for the

00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:55,060
community it's my sincere hope that in

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
12 more years this history lesson will

00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,630
require a lot more than five minutes

00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,870
thank you

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:06,360
[Music]

00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,360
[Applause]

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:43,680
okay and next we have Andy before for

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:46,590
tips on how to start their own ladies

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,110
group or how to encourage more ladies to

00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:52,280
participate and mapping an OpenStreetMap

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:56,850
so I hope that through this presentation

00:16:52,280 --> 00:17:00,030
we can inspire more to mobilize more

00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:02,340
women both men and women women to start

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:05,360
projects for underrepresented

00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:08,550
communities and for their adversities so

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,400
this is a project and how good miss

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:14,819
Nelly you too Claire Danner and Mike

00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,560
laboratory were all the jsapi

00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,390
specialists for the Philippines

00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,050
Department of Social Welfare and

00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,990
Development

00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:24,890
so mapa bye-bye um it's actually

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:28,560
composed of two words napa and by by a

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:32,040
map me map a nice map and by bias woman

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:36,900
but together these two words mean also

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:41,910
women too so what why why this project

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:45,750
so we we agree that a map sometimes only

00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:50,730
shows what the map maker knows or at

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:54,390
least cares to show so with a lot of map

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:56,790
makers who are men there are all there

00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:00,480
could be gaps so we want to help fill

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:04,080
this gap and through OpenStreetMap you

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,080
want to encourage more women to make

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,090
rajma projects

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,340
so let's look back a bit

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:15,730
so I'm sure a lot of us already know

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:19,810
about this the woman mapper has been I

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,040
had has been challenged to join has been

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:25,660
through a lot of challenges

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:28,630
so before mapping has was made vine

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:32,010
ships and women were not allowed to

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:34,690
enter universities so those are

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:39,130
challenges for women to join the mapping

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:42,760
process and if you recognize this Buy

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:46,180
and a nun in the 10th century that's the

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:50,590
first map that heard but that's made by

00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:55,500
a woman and this one in the 1800's by

00:18:50,590 --> 00:19:01,030
Shanna did hit she did it this map for

00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:03,910
she mapped the history of her tribe and

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:08,050
the Philippines if you can see here in

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:11,620
this photo is from 2009 to 2011 okay at

00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:16,180
first there are at most two to seven

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:19,210
ratio of women to men so we want to

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,490
change this ratio and we did this

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:25,540
through the map of Avaya workshop it's

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:27,730
it started in 2018 as part of the

00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:32,110
International Women's Day so we first

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:34,810
thought OpenStreetMap and we we didn't

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:38,290
mapathon with women and for women so men

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:41,470
are also invited and from the

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:43,210
participants inputs we recognize that

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,480
these are the facilities that are

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:49,110
important for women to be mapped so for

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:54,580
health for fertility clinics hospitals

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:57,160
for protective fal'cie desks violence

00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,010
against women and children tasks women

00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,980
and children protection desks and the

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:07,660
others that are listed here and this is

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:10,300
the output on that first mapathon so we

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,920
thought that why not choose one of these

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,920
facilities that are important to women

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,050
and make a map added of it so we made

00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:22,270
map over by it too we did not provide

00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,940
you but we did several series of

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,880
mapathon

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:29,860
different venues and dates to be able to

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,750
make this outward map so it shows the

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:38,900
number of cases of violence against

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:40,700
women as the base layer and then it can

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,580
be overlaid with the hospitals police

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:47,590
stations breast feeding stations also

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:51,800
from the sub projects of jail ladies and

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:55,190
centers for women and other facilities

00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:59,150
that cater to women women's needs and

00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:04,460
lastly in March 2019 we also had macapa

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:07,250
by 2019 when women map it's focused on

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,530
women as agents of development and admin

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,480
and to answer the question what happens

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:15,020
when women map and these are the

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,840
highlights of the feedback and answers

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,420
to that question so I recognized OSM as

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,340
a venue to empower local knowledge maps

00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,560
are useful to locate facilities for

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,560
operations especially in the far-flung

00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:30,230
areas in this women's perspectives

00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,180
matter so inclusive mapping labels are

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,310
inclusiveness political social and

00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,560
economic areas it can be a tool for

00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:40,060
public participation and hopefully

00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:43,140
democratization thank you

00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,140
[Applause]

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,240
[Music]

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:53,430
[Applause]

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,080
okay so we do have a couple minutes here

00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,270
for questions so I'll have all the

00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,140
speakers come I'm sorry that's totally

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:05,450
not true at all

00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:05,450
I live entirely our final speakers Illya

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,430
[Applause]

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:32,840
it's working yeah but should work so hi

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:37,160
I'm les girlfriend

00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,900
I work in Juneau and junuh working in

00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,680
Juneau allows me to help OpenStreetMap

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,390
and quite unexpected ways like just two

00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,170
weeks ago I was talking about how we

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:51,470
shared all of our GPS traces for

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:55,370
OpenStreetMap and now we needed a geo

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:57,590
coder and when you think geocoding well

00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:01,520
in relation is OpenStreetMap the first

00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:02,840
thing comes to mind is nominated it's

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,140
pretty boots is maintained by the

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:09,620
community everyone uses it and we tested

00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:12,740
it and decided to package it into

00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:16,700
container and put in production so I was

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:20,360
tasked with docker isin it but it turns

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:23,630
about to turn to be quite complex tasks

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:27,020
it's big and it has very many moving

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:30,190
parts so I asked for couple days to try

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:33,650
make something better and smaller and

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,690
why I thought I could do it because most

00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,060
decoders well all of them inclusion

00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:40,010
emanating I built this for Webb jacory

00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,920
in might like from address you get a

00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:45,470
location and you have to focus on

00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,210
parsing texts and building structure

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,400
from that and we need to reverse the

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:52,550
decoder and there were no the reverse

00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:56,720
decoders on the market but for usual

00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:59,660
decoders reverse geocoding is just not

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,730
the sort it's just finding a closest

00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,790
object like a closed polygon to the

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:07,190
location and producing the results for

00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:09,520
most cases that works like finally

00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,590
closest building finest address and

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,110
print the result but opposite map is not

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:18,700
perfect in opposite map there are many

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:22,280
unmapped or party map places and many

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,650
animals like what do you do when there's

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,170
a building inside a building which of

00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,840
the addresses you return

00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:32,620
or for example where there is a building

00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:37,240
with house number but no street from

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:39,550
which street doing for the name or when

00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,340
the house is on the opposite side of the

00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:44,830
street do you return it or do you in

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,860
first and fall house number or something

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,170
and the first forced case is interesting

00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,440
in that it's very very long building and

00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:56,200
by giving its address you might confuse

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,640
the user sometimes it's better to give a

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:03,430
different address like building near it

00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,850
also there are address points very

00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:08,800
usually used for corner Bill Jones

00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:11,230
corner buildings that have two or more

00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,290
addresses and as first it looks simple

00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,730
just take the closest one and return it

00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:18,340
but when the dress points inside

00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:20,530
buildings they infer the end dresses on

00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,290
the whole building so in the first case

00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:25,780
it's not right to return the closest

00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,610
addressed object like most debtors do

00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,850
you have to return the building's number

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:33,760
six which in first it address from

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:36,970
address point number six and the second

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,870
case point 62 is closer to the location

00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:43,750
but the location is closer to Street K

00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:47,890
so you might want to address a street

00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:50,650
which is 11 and addresses in opposite I

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,530
can go on anything it's just a couple

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,990
texts they can go on address points on

00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:58,570
points of interest like shops and cafes

00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:02,950
and on the building that contains them

00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:05,320
as well and determining a proper address

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,530
for allocation becomes quite interesting

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:12,580
and non-obvious tasks it's not just

00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:14,200
returning the closest point and there

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,070
are also points of interest that are

00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:21,580
polygonal like schools or churches they

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:23,800
mark the dress for a territory and you

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,720
don't always want to return the

00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,480
territory address for a location like

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,670
for the red point it is better to return

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,670
house number 35 than 14

00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:37,500
in this case we just transfer the

00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:40,230
address to the biggest like the main

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,870
building of the area that's usually

00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:45,240
correct and where polygons all points

00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:49,470
can be inside buildings in this case we

00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:52,019
convert them to a point there's just a

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,899
few examples from our hundreds of test

00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:56,820
cases there are also different ways of

00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:59,669
addressing all posted map like address

00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:02,760
interpolation or place addresses instead

00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:04,740
of suitcases but since we as junuh

00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,309
operate only in New York City we decided

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:13,440
it address points and buildings could be

00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:16,830
enough and these things also work it

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,440
works in production is deployed and it's

00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:22,350
quite fast more than 50 requests per

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,110
second in a single core and basically

00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:28,200
inside it just a dozen of SQL scripts so

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,029
it is very easy to package and some of

00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,000
these scripts work on the plane is

00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:35,250
mt.fuji scale database and just last

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,679
week we got permission to publish it in

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:42,500
the open source so by this address you

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,500
can see it in your field that's all

00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:53,680
[Applause]

00:27:50,070 --> 00:28:01,030
and for maybe one quick question for any

00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:03,880
of our speakers they take it yes so

00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:06,240
basically how do you deal with at

00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,880
countries where there aren't actually

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,460
addresses but you say it's 30 meters far

00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,840
away from this in this supermarket or so

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:22,210
on so is this something this project is

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:24,400
also taking into account I didn't quite

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:27,580
get the question but the idea was here

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:33,160
to set limits how far the address can be

00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:35,920
and that for example a shop has its

00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:39,490
address inside 20 to 30 meters but the

00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:42,610
plain address point deals with the whole

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:45,960
building and stuff so yeah the algorithm

00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:48,640
is quite complex and in that address

00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,760
wiki's help you can see hard-soled

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,910
calculations the geo coder itself is

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,390
just one big scale script it's heavily

00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,390
commented
