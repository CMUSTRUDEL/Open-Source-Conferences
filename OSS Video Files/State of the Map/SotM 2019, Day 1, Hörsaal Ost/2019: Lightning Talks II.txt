## OpenStreetMap intrinsic quality assessment using “Is OSM up-to-date?” web application 
Marco Minghini and Francesco Frassinelli
Approaches to analyze OpenStreetMap (OSM) intrinsically, i.e. based on the history of data, have become an established way to achieve a wide range of final goals, most importantly to study its quality. Started in 2017, “Is OSM up-to-date?” is an open source web application licensed under AGPL and mainly written in Python. It can be also run in the command line or inside a Docker container. The target beneficiaries of the software are OSM users and communities, who need to assess the quality of data in a given area to decide whether to use it or not as well as where mapping efforts should be best directed, and OSM researchers and scholars, who can use it as a tool to help in their OSM quality studies. The project has a dedicated wiki page (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Is_OSM_up-to-date), source code is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate) and a demo is available at https://is-osm-uptodate.frafra.eu. Using the OSM API, the web application generates history-based, quality-oriented visualizations of OSM nodes and ways having at least one tag for any rectangular user-selected region. Such visualizations (on top of a grayscale OSM basemap) are available for the following criteria: date of creation, date of last edit, number of versions, number of different contributors who edited that node or way, and frequency of update. When an OSM node or way is clicked, a popup shows its values for the previously mentioned criteria as well as the list of currently available tags and the links to the OSM iD editor (in edit mode on that node or way), history and details of that node or way (both linked to the OSM website). A number of additional features to further improve the analysis of quality is currently planned (see https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate/labels/enhancement).

## Deriviste - Click and Go Photo Mapping
Christopher Beddow
There are many OSM editing tools, but only one that allows the user to click inside a Mapillary image to add new data to the map. Richard Fairhurst's Deriviste tool was a quick experiment that proved this was possible, but it's important to ask more questions. How useful is the tool? How accurate and precise is it? How can it be improved?

## "MAPAbabae": Using OSM as a Tool for Mapping with Women and For Women
Andi Tabinas, Arnalie Vicario
We would like to share how we, as part of the Social Welfare and Development agency of the Philippines (DSWD), have utilized OSM to have a collaborative and gender-inclusive approach of mapping points of interests catering to women.

## Reverse Geocoding Is Not Simple
Ilya Zverev
Having seen a dozen of different geocoders, I did not expect to find myself writing another one. But here I am, tasked with making a reverse geocoder better than the industry-standard Nominatim. Turns out it is a fun and not so straightforward task. Let’s see what can go wrong.
