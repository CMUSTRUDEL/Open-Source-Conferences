Title: 2019: VR Map: Using OSM Data In a WebVR Environment
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 1, HÃ¶rsaal Ost
Description: 
	Can you actually walk through or fly over a 3D scene of live OSM data using a VR headset - and if so, can this be done in a way that easily transforms to a view on a normal computer (or mobile) screen?
The answers are "Yes" and "Yes", and this talk will show how this can be done with relatively simple code, and just inside a web browser!

Mixed Reality (XR), i.e. Virtual and Augmented Reality, opens up new possibilities for 3D visualizations of OpenStreetMap data. With WebXR and Mozilla's A-Frame library, it's really simple to create cross-device XR experiences running right in the browser with very little code, and scaling well from mobile via laptop/desktop to fully immersive VR headset experiences. VR Map is a demo that brings all that together and allows you to walk or "fly" through a virtual model of the real world courtesy of live OSM data from the Overpass API.

The talk will describe WebXR as Mixed Reality APIs for the browser and A-Frame as Mozilla's library to make it really simple to build WebXR scenes. Then, it will dive into how those technologies were used together with live OSM data to create the VR Map demo and show how it enables people to move through virtual models built from that real-world data. This will include a dive into an actual live demo, and into the HTML+JavaScript code used to create this experience. Through all that, it hopefully will show an interesting new perspective on OpenStreetMap - and hopefully inspire developers to build similar experiences.

hi I would like to show a few chemistry

00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,240
experiments for you because I studied

00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:18,190
chemistry and okay

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,779
for that no not in the wrong place with

00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,500
the wrong crowd I guess but I'm missing

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:26,320
the periodic table of elements here

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:30,430
still I will talk about OpenStreetMap

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,430
stuff of course and about my demo I put

00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,050
together called we are map that uses

00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:39,040
Open Street Map data in a web we are

00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:43,239
environment this lights are already up

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,070
if any of you want to go to them there

00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,350
right now there for the first piece a

00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,739
bone slice of carrot or a tea for the

00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:55,290
past you can use the full for future you

00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:59,769
can use the full URL here

00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:01,690
short thing for me I'm Robert Kaiser my

00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:04,379
nickname and a lot of web places is

00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:08,170
Cairo that's also my username on

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:12,580
OpenStreetMap I've been a mapper since I

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:15,040
think 2007 I saw on my profile my email

00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,290
and and website are up there I'm a

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,000
Mozilla tech speaker this is the tech

00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,659
speakers logo in case you wonder what

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,189
I'm wearing here I'm a volunteer for

00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:26,979
Mozilla who goes to conferences and

00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:29,859
talks about web technologies I'm based

00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:32,350
in Vienna in Austria and I'm not on most

00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:36,399
social networks if you look for me but I

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:39,039
am on a few smaller ones including

00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:42,130
telegram which we're using here for some

00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:49,329
of the communication as well look to the

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:53,950
slides if you want links so what do we

00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:55,630
want to get from this talk for one thing

00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:59,350
I want to show you the cross device

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,869
nature of web VR or web X are the ease

00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:05,170
of use of the a frame library or

00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:07,990
framework whatever you call it and the

00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:12,330
ability to use OpenStreetMap data in an

00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,330
environment like that and how to use it

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:22,210
so first I said bad PR or in web X R

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,460
what do those words mean web PR is web

00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:29,230
reality powered by web technologies

00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:32,050
which a lot of people may have seen

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:36,220
virtual reality devices like the oculus

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:40,210
go or HTC vive or our different headsets

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:43,570
or even those phone mounted things like

00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,760
gear we are or Google cardboard or

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:50,080
things like that you can actually

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,420
powered those with web technologies it's

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,380
evolving right now into the web X our

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:59,980
device API where X R means mixed reality

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,900
or some call it extended reality we are

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,770
basically virtual and augmented reality

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,720
put put together into one standard

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,600
because they're very similar in terms of

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,000
what you need in technology it's a

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,490
proposed open standard in concert with

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,350
WebGL which some of you may have heard

00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:22,720
of Web Audio and gamepad API is and in

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,110
terms of browser support we have support

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,740
in Firefox release on on PC on Windows

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,780
and Mac Linux is in development mostly

00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:36,100
because the drivers for the headsets are

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,660
pretty shaky on Linux still and then

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,930
there are some graphics patches for

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,030
Firefox that are still needed chrome has

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,530
some experimental support in development

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:50,200
versions that you can turn on with a

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:53,320
flag and standalone headsets like the

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,710
oculus browser here in this headset or

00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,170
Firefox reality which is a browser for

00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:03,250
standalone headsets or Samsung Internet

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,010
and on the whole lens the version of

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,530
edge that is on there those have support

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,560
for web VR as well so it is actually

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:14,500
supported for multiple browsers on the

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,810
PC for the PC connected headsets it's

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,250
pretty much Firefox only right now the

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:24,710
chrome seems to be working on it

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:29,280
so one thing I would be interested in is

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:38,520
who of you is has been developing any

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:43,770
code or who has not of those who have

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:49,710
have not who has not done any HTML

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:55,020
editing one okay so everybody has at

00:04:49,710 --> 00:05:00,090
least seen how HTML document works and

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,580
that will be very helpful because we

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:07,890
will come back to that when I get to the

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:12,180
to how this is built a demo web we are

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,950
map is as I said using web we are with

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,320
live OpenStreetMap data from the

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,730
overpass API we will see a little bit

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,730
from of that as well

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:25,140
it's usable in 2d mode on any modern

00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:29,520
browser so you can open it on your phone

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:32,370
your PC in Firefox in chrome in edge

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:39,320
whatever in any modern browser and you

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:39,320
will see it 2d window into the 3d world

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,100
but if you have a headset and

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,940
controllers you can fully immerse

00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:51,419
yourself into the VR experience with

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,850
those it's using the e frame framework I

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,479
will come back to that later and it's

00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,180
pretty simple it's about HT lines of

00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,520
HTML most of which are actually the

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,070
intro dialogue and then a little bit of

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,820
very important coated set up sets up the

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:12,150
scene and about 600 lines of JavaScript

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:15,150
which which is not too much because some

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,890
of that is very simple selectors on how

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,729
I estimate for example building heights

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:23,070
and some calculations to transform

00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:26,550
coordinates which if you have worked

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,039
with OpenStreetMap data in some way or

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,090
map data in some way you know that

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,830
coordinate translations are something

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,680
you need quite a bit

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:39,160
so let's go into the demo right away

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:42,910
when you open it up first and you saw

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,310
the URL you can call it up yourself if

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:51,370
you want to it's on VR map dot Cairo dot

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:53,410
eighty so if you go into it at first you

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:57,970
will get this introduction dialog where

00:06:53,410 --> 00:07:00,070
you can select a few scenes here it

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:04,090
starts in front of the building I live

00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:07,780
in so unfortunately you know where I

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,310
live but they on the other hand I run a

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,600
business and I need to publish my

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:17,800
address for that anyhow so it doesn't

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,290
change a lot so you can load a few

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:25,810
things here I did not add haidle back

00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:29,080
here I did not get to that but say I

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:33,760
want to load New York Salo location it

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:37,870
loads up New York and then I can see it

00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:42,630
in 2d mode here I can use the W is the

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:48,550
keys to go or fly around in the scene

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:50,710
and if trees are in there in

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,020
OpenStreetMap with a pretty good data

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:57,070
set you actually see different heights

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:59,380
and sizes of trees even different kinds

00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:03,940
of trees if we have needle lifts and

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:06,310
broadleaf trees and different building

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,460
heights as you see here this is the

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,180
scene from where I live as we saw in in

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,260
New York

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:16,360
you actually have some building colors

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:22,750
where OpenStreetMap s colors on the

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:26,100
buildings on the ground you have the map

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:33,340
Nick layer for additional orientation

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:35,890
and there's also some limits to this you

00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,860
may have seen Perry Perry's here if I

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,900
turn around here you may see some

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:44,110
limitation of how I render stuff

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:50,650
I hope it's it actually did load this or

00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:53,860
they did not I seem to not have the

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:56,740
thing that I wanted which is bad should

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,960
be over there somewhere because it

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,890
should have the Eiffel Tower here oh it

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:07,600
did not load buildings let let me try

00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:14,050
and reload it because I think we should

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:16,030
have time for that as I did not see any

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,450
buildings I only saw trees yet now we

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:22,720
got it you will see one limitation that

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:25,740
that I have in there and that's that

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,380
that is the Eiffel Tower

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:32,830
not exactly how you know it but the only

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:35,710
thing I'm doing there is I take the area

00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:37,750
on the ground and extrude it too to some

00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,420
height and of course that doesn't give

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:46,660
me the form of the Eiffel Tower the

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:50,220
color is right though okay so now that

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:53,080
we've seen a little bit of it let's see

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,330
what I did there so for one thing and

00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,970
that's especially interesting in this

00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,100
crowd I assume that the world is flat

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,940
and actually in two ways there's no

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:08,470
curvature to the earth and there's also

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,920
no hills and valleys but before the Flat

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:14,980
Earth supporters ritual is too much I

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:17,470
actually had to respect where you are on

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,700
earth because the the tiles of in

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:23,500
Mercator projection are different sizes

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,170
depending on how far north or south you

00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,090
are and I actually have to respect that

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,850
to get the correct size in the

00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:34,180
environment the units in the VR

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,710
environment in a frame are meters so I

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:40,930
need to get the correct size of the

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:42,700
tiles in meters and as I said before I'm

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,760
using the map Nick

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,150
tiles via a towel cache so I'm actually

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,880
using the official

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:53,710
Open Street Map rendered tiles but why I

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,960
tell cache that operate myself

00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:59,290
to not get too much load on the

00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,180
OpenStreetMap service and then I have as

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:07,120
you saw trees and buildings in there

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:11,640
from the overpass API what VR also needs

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,980
is a camera and controller setup that

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:19,450
allows you to see your your controllers

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:23,709
in the right shape as you have them and

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:27,700
to be able to move in in multiple ways

00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:30,190
in the scene and as I said before it's

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,770
built with the a frame library which was

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,920
originally created by Mozilla it has now

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,750
been taken over by the community and

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,910
that a frame library makes it really

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:46,740
easy to build something so that's

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:56,010
actually one thing I forgot to preload

00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:56,010
did it okay no no load it here yeah so

00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:05,020
just wanted this loaded so I have the

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:11,020
code here for a very simple a frame

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:19,270
preview and that's this scene which is

00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:26,860
just a sphere a rotating cube a cylinder

00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:31,690
in the and plane on the bottom the code

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:35,290
for that looks like that it's it's very

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:38,230
simple to understand you even if you

00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:40,750
only know HTML it's not the official

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,820
HTML text it's some modified tags so you

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:47,800
have an a scene tag which means your

00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:50,430
scene is inside this and the sphere is

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,730
just a sphere take the cube cube tag

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:56,440
this is an earlier example for a frame

00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:59,470
0.8 the the newer versions have

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,990
animation as an attribute and not a tag

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:06,120
inside the tag but it works pretty

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:09,060
similarly cylinder you see the plane

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:13,830
is basically a sphere around you that

00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:15,900
you view from the inside so you can you

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:21,840
just need some HTML text and you can get

00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:25,740
to something as I'm running a little bit

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:29,930
short on time I will not go into a lot

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:33,450
of the code details there's one HTML

00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:36,930
file with the basic scene and all the

00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:40,650
includes and start dialogue and then

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:44,040
there's some JavaScript files the most

00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:47,780
interesting ones there are the tiles

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:50,880
trees and buildings that load the actual

00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:57,870
objects most interesting of that trees

00:13:50,880 --> 00:14:03,110
and buildings that's up on github so I

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:06,870
want to take one look into the buildings

00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:09,360
because for OpenStreetMap there's one

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:13,050
interesting thing there and that is how

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,050
do I get to the height of buildings and

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,240
you see some variables I put there to

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:22,310
actually estimate the height if there is

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,690
no height tag on the buildings and so I

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,550
use the levels and that's the first

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,040
variable you see there that I'm

00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,380
estimating 3 meters for building levels

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,840
so if there's not a high tech I look at

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,650
the levels if that's not there as well

00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:41,400
then I go to down to defaults based on

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:45,480
the building equals something and if

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,460
that's also not there then I go to just

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:52,560
some standard height which i think is 10

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:55,050
meters unless the building is very small

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,700
then I have some heuristic that I don't

00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:01,550
want to go into because that's a little

00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:03,570
bit more difficult to talk about so

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:08,510
basically if you have done any

00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:13,440
JavaScript so this is the height

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:16,140
calculation if you have done JavaScript

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,230
you know think things like that that's

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,510
how I'm creating the element for the

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:25,110
building the a entity is more or less

00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:27,780
what the div element is in HTML here so

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:31,910
it's a generic container thing I'm

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:35,790
giving it a class just for myself for

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:38,790
being able to take care of those and

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,890
then I'm actually accessing the

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:43,200
underlying three J's library to build

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:48,180
the geometry there because buildings

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:51,690
have pretty different geometry based on

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:55,440
their data and I need to to deal with

00:15:51,690 --> 00:16:00,060
that that's actually not done down here

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:06,000
that it's it's done in the registered

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:09,260
geometry the code for someone who has

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,770
done JavaScript stuff the code should be

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:20,490
pretty easy understandable I hope if

00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:24,710
it's not please ask me so to recap we've

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:27,360
seen how those technologies web we are

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:30,330
WebEx are can be used on different

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,920
devices you may have loaded on this demo

00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,280
on your mobile phone you saw that it

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,780
worked there you saw a 2d version there

00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,390
for my talk you have to believe me that

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,700
it works in here but afterwards are

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:46,770
outside you can actually try it out

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:48,840
yourself in the oculus co headset ease

00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,300
of use of a frame you saw that you can

00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,030
use HTML tags you can then attach

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,190
JavaScript to those you can of course

00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:00,320
also build those tags up with JavaScript

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:03,720
and OpenStreetMap data you saw it used

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,180
please look at the code or or ask me for

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,370
for details on how you will see the very

00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:13,320
simple of overpass queries that I'm

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:17,910
using I just wanted to get to the end

00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:20,520
here and just see if you get to this

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:25,020
slide because I really want you to take

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:28,920
the code and try to use it for your own

00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:32,130
ideas there's two examples here someone

00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,550
who tried to load models that are linked

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,180
in open

00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:39,570
street map and get positioning info on

00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:43,710
how to position it exactly in the map

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:48,630
that's the toon 3d mr and the OSM rail

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:50,820
is someone who built a environment where

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:57,330
you can ride a train through the virtual

00:17:50,820 --> 00:18:02,690
environment basically and that brings me

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:05,940
to the end of the talk itself I will

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:08,700
jump to one thing in the in the code

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,890
here because I mentioned it and here I

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:15,480
think it's a good idea to do this and

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:17,940
that what's that in you know in

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,340
buildings I only build it no here it is

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,840
I wasn't the right file anyhow so this

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:30,480
is how I'm building up the the overpass

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,720
query so we that has a building tag on

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,700
it

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,870
relation that has a building tag on it

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:40,830
both with the bounding box then out body

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:42,570
resolve it out scale QT that's you have

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,220
to look at the word pass documentation

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,260
for the details but that's that's what

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,510
I'm using here and then I convert to

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,380
Jason but we don't go into that in

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:55,450
detail right now so that that's it

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,539
let's get back to this slide

00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,539
[Applause]

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,520
do we have time for a question we do we

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,660
do have a couple minutes first questions

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,660
please feel free to ask

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,550
great presentation I was just curious

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,710
with the roads layers it seems like most

00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,750
of it is still 2d so pretty planar do

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,970
you have any functionality within with

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,590
the layer tag so having roads underneath

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,580
or bridges at all demonstrating that

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:46,890
through the the VR I did not put any

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:51,570
code for this scene into it but it's

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:54,120
possible you could also load some model

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,610
of the terrain and then use that

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,620
information but then you need to respect

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,300
the height information to put the

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,970
buildings and different heights and so

00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,460
on because it doesn't know physics wise

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,830
where the building lands so that's why I

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,970
assumed everything is flat to make it

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:13,800
easier to code this but it would be

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,110
interesting to try and use a terrain

00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,840
model and then get Heights and get

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:21,630
bridges and whatever in there I just

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,410
went with the most simple thing that I

00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:27,650
could also demo on on a session like

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,650
this

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,450
[Music]

00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:42,350
and you while the microphone is going

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:45,320
around you can load 3d models so you

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:50,380
could load a pre created terrain model

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:56,090
for example what information could you

00:20:50,380 --> 00:21:01,299
is worth adding to the map to make make

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:04,640
this virtual reality models better so

00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:07,490
what I found here was that it already

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,640
helped quite a lot when I went around in

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:13,039
my area and mapped how many levels the

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,520
buildings have because that gives you a

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,070
more realistic picture of how what the

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,140
height of the buildings is of course

00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:24,679
exact height of buildings would be even

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,780
better which sometimes is available from

00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:29,480
open government data but not not

00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,600
everywhere and when you're going through

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,460
the street yourself building levels is

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,299
much easier than to find out how high

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,909
this building is right so all those

00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:45,370
things that that make it easier to get

00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:47,870
the height of objects is really the

00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,789
biggest missing piece that I see right

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:52,280
now because we have pretty good

00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:54,980
information when it comes to do 2d but

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,679
the one third dimension is or it would

00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:01,789
already be a big step to get some

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:04,360
information there and that's missing in

00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:04,360
a lot of cases

00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:11,920
one last question

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,920
[Music]

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:23,460
if there's none feel free to come up to

00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:27,239
me I can show you can view it in

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:29,820
Indonesia in the device and call it up

00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:31,889
yourself try to play with the code I'm

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,220
really happy if people make something

00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:34,220
out of it

00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,690
