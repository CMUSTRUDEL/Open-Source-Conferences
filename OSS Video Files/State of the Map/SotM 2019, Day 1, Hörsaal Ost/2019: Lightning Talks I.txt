the first part is the Lightning talks we

00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,070
have four talks here each five minutes

00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,210
and we have two questions right after

00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:21,460
the talks so keep your questions till

00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,660
the end of all the four lightning talks

00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,649
and we have five minutes of questions

00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:30,970
and then we do the room change and so

00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:35,020
we're going to start with talk uses of

00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:37,739
native language in osm by Sivan Sharia

00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,739
so on

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,340
hello hello everyone

00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:18,460
I am Sean Shahriyar from Bangladesh I am

00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:24,040
here present the uses of native language

00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:26,650
in USM actually native language why

00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,870
important in versum usually you just

00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:34,030
have map is just better for everyone but

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:38,610
as an under developing country like

00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:41,890
Bangladesh the literacy rate is not mass

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,040
in parts per sentence and in the remote

00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:49,210
area you can go to the remote area it is

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,550
very low there are many people who has

00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:55,360
difficulties to recognize an area that

00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:57,970
English description in osm especially in

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,120
the remote area there are many people

00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:04,780
who didn't understand English as well as

00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,810
English map effectively so they can use

00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,450
the map with regular work in or in

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,350
emergency situations like any disaster

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,100
you know

00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:20,050
Bangladesh is so much Jesus starts order

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:21,430
every years but it is the problem to see

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,480
the reals you know what is the real

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,550
scenario in Bangladesh if you see the in

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,840
tuk if you see that Hakka map the

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:34,120
capital city you have found that Dhaka

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,010
City has some mangly or description but

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:42,100
not more as per our local demand but in

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,820
the remote area or divisional area we

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:48,850
are really really seeing LEDs

00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,220
description in osm as a result in the

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,280
remote area mapping should not be

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:59,590
testable to local people and I believe

00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:02,070
that it is the common problem in the all

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,070
countries

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:13,550
what I want to do for that I want to

00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:17,220
input details in Bengali as you know

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:21,230
Bengal is the Bangladeshi native

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:25,290
language and as well as with the English

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:28,740
languages like buildings rose roars P

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,470
wise I mean landmarks name will be in

00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,940
Bengali language with English language

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:38,970
also example if you say the that's point

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,390
is in bangla language is gunas are a

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:45,440
striking row in bangla but in the

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:51,060
English name is a cyclone Center

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:54,780
you know our remote areas people does it

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:58,170
know much more English so if you see the

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,830
cyclone center they don't understand

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:07,620
anything so there so I I want to input

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:16,109
that way that is the way to native

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:20,220
language in OSM if you add the native

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:23,220
language in OSM some advantage for the

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,729
local people so local people who would

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,280
jump of the fully interest on this

00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:33,720
platform they contribute to more

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:38,340
reliable data to diverse them and the

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:42,180
OSM will be the proper used to the local

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:47,040
people and maintain quality data so the

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:49,470
people is know of what is that locally

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,910
they have local knowledge so if he if he

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:57,990
or she put the Latin native language or

00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:04,280
put the data in OSM the OSM data will be

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:10,470
maintained with quality and as well as

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:13,620
if we input native language so we can

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,950
reduce the vulnerability of any

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:20,420
disasters so

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:24,720
and also help the people who didn't

00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:28,860
understand in English so that's why I

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,940
want to show the importance of users

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:40,380
native language innovation thank you

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:42,120
thank you everybody thank you we'll have

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:53,460
questions later after all the library

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:56,940
talks okay so next speaker will be no

00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:00,290
it's a open solidarity solidarity city

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,290
map by Martin over

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,059
[Applause]

00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,590
okay can you put the microphone on so

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:34,300
again solidarity a city map by Martin

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:36,190
over yeah hello everybody I want to

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,190
introduce you to the solve our city map

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,410
the concept behind the Solidarity city

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:45,220
is that everyone is able to participate

00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:48,699
in city life no matter what financial or

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,919
legal start of the personnel and with

00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:55,060
this simple web paper on the left side

00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:57,100
you will find such places there are

00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,530
already many of such places mapped in

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,080
other open data projects first of all of

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:04,690
course open suite map so on a daily

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,120
basis the data is processed the text

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,150
public villain excess forints toilets

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,970
showers fitness stations parks libraries

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,770
for camping cover on sites and you have

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,470
you have any ideas what's left out

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,870
please get in contact then we have the

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,330
food tweeze brushes and not treats for

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,300
moon talk dot orc or the public food

00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:29,169
storage places forms food food sharing

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,750
dot di and the repair cafes the database

00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:34,030
should be extended in the future if you

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,669
have any ideas please get in contact and

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,460
then we have a simple web editor were

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:42,280
able to map the more project specific

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,380
places or better collar ends I will give

00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,940
you an example on the right side you see

00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,430
the city of Dusseldorf

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,260
and here's the category of sport of web

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,349
app there over 20 categories available

00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,930
and the Northeast marked in red they are

00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:59,860
awesome fitness stations and all other

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,650
places are temporary weekly sports event

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,539
the whole thing called sport in the park

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,419
in düsseldorf and there you can many

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:09,789
sports from aerobic from to Zumba but

00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,770
only for a special time so you have to

00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,139
leave this places all next week when the

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,630
summer is finished but I think this

00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:21,880
place is probably best practice advice

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:24,100
don't map temporary events you can click

00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,970
on the icon in this case is the

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:30,490
category medical care and opens with all

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:33,760
the information available if available

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,760
you can jump directly to the website get

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,350
in touch via mail or ring them up and on

00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,470
the bottom we offer description of the

00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:43,599
place which could be quite special and

00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,790
then we have a little legal note on the

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,880
bottom which brings us to an exponent

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:51,480
the language barriers over 100 languages

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,220
are supported and whenever possible

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,560
human translation are used you could do

00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:00,060
them with the web editor as a fallback

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,410
mode we have the Google Translation Rp

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,600
unfortunately there was no open source

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,000
alternative especially when it comes to

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,900
languages in the area of conflicts from

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,610
conflicts from the Middle East this list

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,400
were even extended in the eyes of

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,190
standard K U stands for coders which is

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,040
a meta language and not command G like

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,440
Google users and the two other main

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,350
Kurdish languages Central Corridor Ani

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,510
and South Scottish palawan e we edit so

00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,180
you could do translations as languages

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,800
but you cannot map originally in this

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,200
language just because there's no for

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,090
baek-mae with who edible in fact a

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,010
friend of mine is the natives who aren't

00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,760
speaking code so most of the translation

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:44,590
the database are now in Suwanee let's

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,840
have a quick look at the web editor on

00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,240
the white side here you could create

00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,630
places edit them or delete them and do

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,760
the translations and beside other other

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,860
other attributes like wheelchair

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,590
accessibility there's also an attribute

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,630
if this place is already mapped in

00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,510
OpenStreetMap and not so you can never

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,490
look at the data if this place is worth

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:09,760
or not to memory in open Sweetman do it

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,910
by yourself last but not least other

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,620
thing is free data and software the

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,080
artists re-arrest endpoint as a geo

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,150
Jason and multi-line sense for maximal

00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,270
possible users so no problem to use this

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:25,150
in OpenStreetMap in the one way then we

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:27,760
have the swagger open REST API web

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:30,760
mapping service and all the code is on

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,230
github and based on open layers so

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,150
thanks a lot for your attention that I

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,240
hope for contributions

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,240
[Applause]

00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:41,559
Harry Levin time in team

00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:00,429
yeah can you hear me okay

00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,839
mmm I've been informed I only have five

00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,739
minutes not seven so I'll probably have

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,429
to come back and finish the presentation

00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:10,239
next year my name's Sean Lynch and I'm

00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:12,730
the developer of open letter Mac back in

00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:15,999
2009 I was studying geography in first

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:19,629
year University and I was introduced to

00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:21,879
GIS and up until that point you know I

00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:25,660
was strongly interested in digital games

00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:27,519
when I was introduced to GIS my interest

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,160
shifted dramatically from digital games

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,939
to digital science fast-forward a couple

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,220
years later and there was this area near

00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:38,919
my house that's plagued by illegal

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,749
dumping burnt-out cars and anti-social

00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:43,540
behavior and I thought wouldn't it be

00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:45,790
very interesting if I could use GIS put

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,399
this data on a map communicated to

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:51,129
educate society and use the data to get

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,529
a fixed fast forward another couple of

00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:56,799
years and after teaching myself how to

00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:59,470
code and April 2017 after being inspired

00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,910
by Open Street Map I thought why not

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,649
apply the same principles of

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,169
crowdsourcing and open data at the

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:08,529
plastic pollution and open data map was

00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:10,600
born so it's OpenStreetMap as a base

00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:12,730
layer and then the litter data is

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,829
layered on top and it's all accessible

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,499
as open data you can download all the

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:20,230
call the data by country state or city

00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:23,470
and over the last two and a half years

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,850
we've crowd-sourced data from you know a

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:30,699
nearly two-and-a-half thousand people

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:33,939
across over 60 countries it's a web app

00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:35,769
that recently launched on iOS as well as

00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:37,569
the global map you can click on the

00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,129
World Cup where we have the countries of

00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:40,869
the world competing against each other

00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:43,209
and if you drill down through the

00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:45,039
contrary the state and the city with a

00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:47,199
smaller amount of data we can render

00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:50,139
more sophisticated maps so this is a

00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:52,569
weighted hexagonal grid map on the left

00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:54,429
hand side that's a Skibbereen in Ireland

00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:56,649
in the middle you have a snare and

00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:59,019
Netherlands and on the right hand side

00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:00,669
that is cigarette waste or

00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,399
smoking-related waste cigarette butts

00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:05,049
mostly outside the Bundestag and in

00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,819
Berlin I think I promise that correctly

00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:07,540
but you can notice that you can toggle

00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,459
the layer

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,470
by behavior so you can see where is the

00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:13,120
alcohol-related letter occurring where

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,519
is the coffee related litter occurring

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,930
what brands are responsible for their

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,310
products rotting in the environment

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,370
where is the smoking-related litter

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,899
occurring etc so as I mentioned we've

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,250
the countries of the world competing

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:26,259
against each other and what I call the

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,380
litter World Cup to see who is creating

00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:31,420
the most open data on plastic pollution

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:34,750
and when someone uploads to open letter

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,310
map I take the address of that we have

00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,050
an open street map of that value and I

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,660
use those values to populate the

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,579
database dynamically so if your location

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,259
doesn't exist yet simply by uploading

00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:46,300
you'll automatically include your

00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:48,370
location at the the litter World Cup

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:52,600
where the countries of the world compete

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,610
against each other as I said I recently

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,709
launched for iOS

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,949
I've yet to push this colorful update

00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:01,509
but we're soon to launch on Android but

00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:04,839
as you can see the user takes a photo of

00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:06,279
litter tags what litter is in that photo

00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,860
and you can tag any amount of litter in

00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,480
a single photo and then uploads that

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,269
which will render the data automatically

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,980
I should also add that I manually verify

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:19,660
all of the data in each image to remove

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,310
any ambiguity from citizen science data

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,199
but also to gather really high quality

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,839
data for machine learning which I'm

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,120
studying at the moment you know we have

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,100
data for streets but what we don't have

00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,839
is the data for you know what on those

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,459
streets in terms of litter and plastic

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,290
pollution and we don't understand yet

00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:37,510
how that moves over time or how it's

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,579
entering the ocean and in fact the the

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,620
cities that we live on are designed to

00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:43,329
facilitate what I call the illusion of

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,190
urban cleaning so you can see here that

00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:47,680
pot holds grid storm drains

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,690
while they remove rainwater they also

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,250
remove a lot of litter from the

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,319
environment as well and an interesting

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,300
experiment you can do is just take a

00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:57,490
glass jar and pop some cigarettes in

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,170
there and watch that water water quality

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,240
change this will give you a rough idea

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:04,209
of the effect that smoking litter has on

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,130
our water up until now plastic pollution

00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:08,290
has been largely characterized as a

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,870
marine phenomenon it's estimated as

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,759
about 916 tons of plastic going into the

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,870
ocean every hour and we don't really

00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,389
even know where it is

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,579
data is significantly lacking but

00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:20,470
although it has a significant impact on

00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,110
the marine environment we need to be

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,570
more Pro

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:25,579
active and go upstream and communicate

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:29,360
plastic pollution where people live

00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:33,079
because this is a much more interactive

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,970
and it's a closer to home approach that

00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,430
has the potential to change human and

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,019
institutional behavior

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,149
I've also invented litter corn which is

00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:42,529
the first blockchain token rewarded for

00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,529
the production of geographic information

00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:48,290
so I applied the principles of proof of

00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:50,120
work from Bitcoin to citizen science for

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,579
the first time but let me tell you what

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,410
later coin is not it's not an IC or

00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:57,529
money grabber it's not meant to be

00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:00,019
listed at any exchanges it simply

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:02,480
rewards proof of work for open data and

00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:04,640
geographic information and I want to try

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,040
and use litter coin to pay people to

00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,420
create geographic information and I

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,519
believe this is the potential to

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,870
incentivize the most rapid production of

00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,350
crowd-sourced data the world has ever

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,660
seen

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,579
potentially leading to a situation where

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,260
if people could get paid to do it it

00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:19,910
could lead to you know a global

00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:23,420
production of open data and about 15

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,010
minutes and in the future as well open

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,110
another map is now currently open source

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:29,029
but that's the plan but and in the

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,230
future people be able to vote on every

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,890
part of the ecosystem through a

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,990
decentralized autonomous organization so

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,699
to close I'm looking at this is a call

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,380
to action currently I'm doing all this

00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:41,510
by myself but I'm launching several

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,579
working groups today so I'm looking for

00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,769
people to volunteer and to contribute to

00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:48,620
software development mostly PHP

00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,040
JavaScript and block and machine

00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,350
learning

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,300
second working group if people would

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,070
like to contribute in terms of community

00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,620
development I'm looking for local and

00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,170
national coordinators for marketing etc

00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,180
third working group is research how do

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,429
we use the data how good is it

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,120
how statistically significant is it etc

00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:09,890
and finally a management committee for

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,110
oversight and future direction in

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,370
platform so that's over another map

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,540
thanks for listening and I hope you join

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,540
me in math the world's plastic pollution

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:39,470
we're coming out to the last speaker so

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,660
we have to talk now map to end female

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:48,830
genital mutilation and the talk is given

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:54,170
by a Jin the Chapman thank you very much

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:56,480
can you hear me okay okay so I've been a

00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:59,030
volunteer with Tanzania Development

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,190
Trust for the last six years I've

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,440
normally spend about two months a year

00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,230
in Tanzania and I very quickly realized

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,450
that there's very much of Tanzania like

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,580
many African plate countries that are

00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,760
very very poorly mapped so for the last

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:16,130
four years we've been mapping rural

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,640
Tanzania in an initiative called crowd

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:21,590
to map and one of the reasons that we're

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,470
doing that is to help protect girls from

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:26,000
female genital mutilation FGM and for

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,060
people who don't know what that means

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,520
I've put the four main types here and

00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,220
it's a big issue in certain parts of

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:38,480
Tanzania particularly because it's a

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:41,030
tribal issue it's an issue in the

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,040
Northeast particularly so we're working

00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,800
with local activists on the ground in

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,540
Tanzania to help them map their

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,310
communities to better protect these

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:54,920
girls and girls like the ones here so

00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:58,100
we're working with a really amazing FGM

00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:01,700
activists particularly this woman Roby

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:04,880
samwell II she was cut against her will

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,830
when she was 13 nearly bled to death and

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,140
now she does outreach work telling

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,030
people about the dangers of FGM and her

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,640
work was really hampered by the fact

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:17,930
that she didn't have access to maps of

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:21,530
the surrounding area she's organized his

00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:23,990
two safe houses but girls couldn't find

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:27,860
the safe houses and safe house staff and

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:31,190
the police can't find the girls so much

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,730
of rural Tanzania still looks like the

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,410
picture at the top

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:39,030
whereas places like Jerusalem of

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,610
extremely well mapped particularly

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,440
through initiatives like Romani hariya

00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,720
that have done a lot of mapping thereon

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,140
there's people in the door in the room

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,660
here that have contributed to that

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:54,750
so activists in rural Tanzania need maps

00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:57,480
for many reasons to protect girls from

00:19:54,750 --> 00:20:00,870
FGM but also for more general community

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,400
development so crowd to maps been going

00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,140
for four years now we've got around

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,060
eleven and a half thousand online

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,180
volunteers who are from all over the

00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:12,990
world that are helping map from

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:15,030
satellite images to do a base map so

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:20,480
these are some of the places where they

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:26,760
came from and so far we've added around

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:30,690
mm 3.6 million buildings into

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:34,290
OpenStreetMap using the hot tasking

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:37,440
manager and these are some of the areas

00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:39,870
where we've particularly maps so mostly

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:44,040
for against FGM but also for more

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:47,160
general community development and we've

00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:50,100
also used map swipe and app - how many

00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,740
people know about maps were excellent

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,420
developed here in Heidelberg there so

00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,260
map swipe has been helpful for

00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:01,440
identifying the places that need mapping

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:05,040
where there are buildings so using the

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,320
tasking manager we've also taken open

00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:11,370
government data such as school locations

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:14,430
and clinic locations and put that into

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:17,130
Open Street Map so by copying manually

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,960
the latitude and longitude and then

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,730
looking at a satellite image and

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:27,540
thinking does that look like a school if

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:30,660
so then labeling it as that like this we

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:33,270
have a slack channel of over 3,000

00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:36,180
members now and it's been really really

00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:38,550
successful in giving immediate feedback

00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,290
to new mappers the vast majority of

00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,740
their remote mappers have come from the

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:45,850
UN online volunteering service and most

00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,549
of them are completely new to OSA

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,470
had never heard of osm before so this is

00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:52,210
a really good way of having some more

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,190
advanced mappers who will give them

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,330
immediate feedback on their first edits

00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,889
so that they can improve but we're also

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,879
working with people on the ground in

00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:04,749
Tanzania

00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:07,929
so we've training them to use the map

00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:10,479
stop me a free app that uses Open Street

00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:15,399
Map data which is fantastic for routing

00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:19,619
but also you can add data so people in

00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:22,749
on in Tanzania are adding points such as

00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:26,470
school names village names water points

00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:30,099
etc and thanks to Ilya who I think is

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:32,259
here who's helped us a lot with that so

00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:35,379
better Maps have helped over 3000 girls

00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:38,229
find safe houses and coincide with a

00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:40,330
reduced FGM death rate every year

00:22:38,229 --> 00:22:43,479
girls bleed to death and their bodies

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,340
are thrown into the bushes but having

00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:49,929
better Maps is one way of helping

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:52,239
protect them so we've trained over 1,600

00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:56,739
local activists in many different areas

00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:58,629
of Tanzania around 40% of female we've

00:22:56,739 --> 00:23:01,419
had support from humanitarian

00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:04,269
OpenStreetMap as a microgrid two years

00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:08,970
ago and also with net Hope which allowed

00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:10,989
us to get small cheap smartphones

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,429
generally in these communities people

00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:14,679
don't have access to smartphones

00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:18,220
particularly women so that was extremely

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,960
helpful last year we were invited to

00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,220
organize a mass phone at the United

00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:26,080
Nations General Assembly by unfpa and we

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,599
also had satellite events in many

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,119
countries and I think some of the people

00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:35,470
here helped with that so thank you very

00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:39,669
much and these are some of the events so

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:42,999
it's an ongoing initiative it's very

00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:44,470
easy to make real difference to people

00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:46,539
in Tanzania so if you're at all

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,909
interested please get involved and

00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:52,359
helpers we particularly need people to

00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:54,849
help with validation and feedback to new

00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:56,230
mappers to train them to become you know

00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:59,429
better mappers in the future

00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,429
so thank you

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:09,480
so we have a couple of minutes to four

00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:18,200
questions to any of the for lightning

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:18,200
talk presenters any questions yes please

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:33,840
I think here one for the great talks I

00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,080
just a quick question at the Solidarity

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:40,020
city map how does it go with integration

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,610
with other countries outside of Germany

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,049
we haven't seen any of that so this is

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,049
very general question yes worldwide

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,159
thank you

00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:58,529
my question is also about solidarity

00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:00,960
solidarity map and it's about when you

00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:04,279
are talking about those languages that

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,809
are not supported and there are multiple

00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:10,679
Kurdish languages like northern Kurdish

00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:12,899
certain okay when you don't have a

00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:18,029
translation for one of those languages

00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:25,679
oh is it okay to switch to the next

00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:28,020
closest language this is very no no

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,700
definitely not the Kurdish language they

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,919
can't understand each other and have

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:36,289
different alphabets even person in Latin

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:38,490
it's really complicated you can do

00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:40,380
translations this languages which is

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:42,929
newless languages but you can then map

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:46,380
originally a point to must do is a other

00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:49,250
language because there's no fallback

00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,250
