Title: 2019: OsmInEdit : a simple indoor editor
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 1, Hörsaal Ost
Description: 
	The Indoor Map Creator is an easy-to-use open-source map editor for OSM indoor data. It's web-based with an intuitive user interface to make mapping indoors accessible and easy for everyone. Check it out and enjoy mapping buildings!

The demand for Indoor Navigation is increasing worldwide. Unlike outdoor GPS navigation, indoor navigation is still rare and expanding at a slow pace. That is in part due to the fragmented landscape for positioning technology and in part due to the absence of indoor maps. Successful mapping starts with good tools. That's why we have developed a tool for mappers to create and edit indoor maps easily. With OSMInEdit we aim to repeat the OSM success story for the indoor space. The foundation for the OSM indoor data model is already laid out. The “Simple Indoor Tagging” schema is the community consensus on how to represent indoor data in OSM. It allows tagging of indoor specific content and is actively used and supported by the community. Popular OSM editors like ID and JOSM lack essential features that are required to map buildings - you need, for example, specific styling to filter data level by level, specific indoor tags, and indoor specific validation rules. OSMInEdit is an easy-to-use use web-based map editor that solves these specific challenges. It offers, for example, “Simple Indoor Tagging” presets, specific indoor styling, the ability to import custom floor plans, display them in the background and an easy way to edit routing graphs.

in the next 20 minutes we are going to

00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:17,330
we're gonna present you what we don't

00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,270
want to do so what we want to do is

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:23,270
simple we want to map buildings indoors

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,919
and we're going to present to you a tool

00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,550
that we have developed in order to do

00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:30,980
that because we think today there isn't

00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,500
a good tool available and that's partly

00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:40,129
the reason why there are not so many

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:41,660
indoor maps there is also the URL to the

00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:46,670
to the tool if you want to check it out

00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:49,369
in between let me give you a short on

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:53,299
outline for the talk so we're gonna

00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:55,510
start with our vision why do we want to

00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:57,979
have in your Maps why develop the tool

00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,610
what are possible applications for

00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:04,000
indoor maps we want to go a little bit

00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:07,700
into the status quo where are we today

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,280
how many maps are there what about the

00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:15,320
data model that is used that has emerged

00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,980
as a consensus as we see it what are the

00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,670
tools why were they not successful in

00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,710
our estimate then we present our tool

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,050
what are the key features why we think

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:30,110
that it addresses the issues the other

00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,970
tools didn't address so far and give a

00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,120
little outlook into what are specific

00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:38,530
challenges regarding indoor tagging or

00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,870
indoor maps in general what are the next

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:44,810
specific steps we're going to take and

00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:47,540
then the most important thing how you

00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,810
can contribute because at the end it's

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:53,210
you who will do the mapping and

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:59,180
hopefully we can contribute a good tool

00:01:53,210 --> 00:02:02,450
to do so so we just picked for example

00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,280
four areas of typical applications

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,770
indoor navigation everybody knows a

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,649
navigation system outdoors but in Norse

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,879
they're still where you could do

00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:15,920
simulations emergency planning on maps

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,159
you can do advertising interesting for

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,599
businesses if they have maps and of

00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,819
course for a maintenance work that's

00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,799
also attractive if

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,950
the light bulb isn't working properly

00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:30,140
and then the facility manager can just

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:36,950
use the map to say hey the light bulb

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:38,540
isn't working please repair so osm

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,420
that's that's an incredible success

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,840
story if you look at it today there are

00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,090
over five million registered users and

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,579
these three pictures tell the story of

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,569
how successful it was the entire world

00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:56,030
was mapped within a short time I would

00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,159
say and when we want to do we want to

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,500
repeat the story indoors because

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,079
buildings are the black sports on the

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,440
map today and we think mapping only

00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:09,099
happens with good tools so that's why we

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,099
developed the tool

00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:17,780
Apple Maps and Google Maps of course

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,760
they already entered the inner space but

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,530
they are not open so they don't provide

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,730
you the data they just give you services

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:27,620
and they have their own reasons to their

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,299
proprietary commercial and we want to we

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:35,510
want to have it open and accessible for

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:38,870
everyone that's our vision so if we look

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:42,410
at where we are today you see there's a

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:45,949
map of the level tech that that's kind

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:50,449
of the tech you use an attribute to see

00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:52,280
if something is indoors there's happened

00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:54,129
a little but not so much in the broad

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,139
community so mostly there were

00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:59,419
initiatives by SNCF for instance they

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:02,419
said we map a bunch of train stations

00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:04,819
and most of the internal apps that are

00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:06,530
today available are done by these

00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:09,470
private initiatives and we want to

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:15,699
really broaden that so that everybody

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:17,590
can take part in mapping indoors and

00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:19,660
earlier

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:23,050
she's gonna tell you a little bit about

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:28,030
the data model and the consensus are you

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:30,580
ever so can you hear me correctly so how

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:34,270
many of us are aware of the simple in

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:39,130
dog tagging scheme can so yeah quite

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:41,590
quite some of you so the idea was to

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,470
make something simple for tagging endo

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,660
so this race this tagging scheme was

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,169
already existing in the OpenStreetMap

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:53,350
communities we didn't invent this and it

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,990
has mainly two tags it has a little tag

00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,570
which arose to say this feature belongs

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:02,470
to this level in a building so you just

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:05,020
put an a value like zero one two and say

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,780
okay this is on this floor and then the

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,000
second second tag is we in the tag

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,640
- allowed to say what kind of feature

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,060
you are describing is it a room is it an

00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:19,120
area corridor and so on so we are two

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,790
main tags there are some over for sure

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,770
but the two mines are this one so if I

00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,770
want to describe for example the bakery

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:29,350
on Liberty one I say in the equals room

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,690
shop the course bakery and Nevada course

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,300
one and that's all it's quite simple and

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:38,770
with this scheme we can do mostly

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,140
everything so there was already existing

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,680
tools for doing indoor mapping which

00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:47,110
have many ID and Joseph Joe Sam is a

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,590
great tool it's widely used in the

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,770
community but it's a general tool I mean

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:56,470
you can add extension you can add plugin

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,960
to manage for example with floorplan if

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,990
you have emergency NAP architect map of

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,810
a building you can add it on chosen and

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,660
draw over to add the features but it's a

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,690
plugin you can have a digital filtering

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,180
it was added not so long ago so you can

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,400
do basic level filtering but it's not on

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,260
link all the cases and you have also

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,100
support for the simple in the tag in

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:23,350
preset so it's not not that bad but

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,539
Jotham is a great tool but it's not

00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,700
meant for everyone I mean you have to

00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:29,790
take some time to learn how to use Joe

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Sam you can't just take two million

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:35,460
add something it's quite difficult when

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,400
when we stuffed and also it's not

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,410
web-based or it kid makes a complicated

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,530
for some people in some condition to

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:46,050
access it so yeah and we are also ID

00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,360
which is also on the bug read tour but

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,270
it doesn't have the possibility to add a

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,300
flop run in the background we can't load

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,330
emergency NAP of a building and start

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,700
adding features you not have also the

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,620
possibility to filter data little by

00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,930
little so if you are editing in the

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,960
earth you know I think Oliver at once

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,460
it's not very convenient and you don't

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,410
have support for the simple ind of

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:15,810
tagging preset which makes things very

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:19,440
difficult so there was also another

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,540
attempt so to make indoor mapping more

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,750
popular in the community for example i

00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:27,330
started a fork of ID which was called ID

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,000
India which I did some basic liberal

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,540
filtering so you can only get one letter

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,510
at a time

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,180
and also adding the simple in the

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:39,090
tagging preset so you can make sense of

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,220
the data you are looking at but it was

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,890
quite limited and it was quite hard to

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,670
follow the track of the new features in

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:50,700
the ID the main ID - on so it was quite

00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:53,700
not maintained for a long time and also

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,160
go to which are many viewer so you can

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,070
view the data but can't edit like open

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,870
develop and open session matter so we

00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,780
are interesting but they are not meant

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:07,890
for editing they are just for seeing the

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:10,620
data so it's not a complete torture so

00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:13,530
that's why we started creating with in

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,620
the this indeed sorry miss endo editor

00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,330
and I will present you who main features

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,810
which are interesting and the first one

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:25,440
is with Rockland eepa import so you can

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:28,050
load images images of emergency not

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,690
architect nap and put it on the map so

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,750
that way you can set the image being as

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:36,570
we at this position on this building and

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:39,960
you can from each of them saying okay

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,039
this plan is far little - so that why

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,099
you are information

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:47,459
of location and also the vertical

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,440
position so you can distort image with

00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:53,360
scale and so on so it's quite easy to

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,190
use you also endure specific feature

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,259
preset so that way you make sense of the

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:02,100
data you have in front of you it's also

00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:06,600
easy to add a new feature so mainly it's

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,730
a zone preset with new feature type so

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,040
you have possibility to add things like

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,730
building structure like room are we as

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,550
world and so on and also in some case

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:23,279
we've found it if it's available on your

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:26,790
data and also you can see from a single

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,819
feature both it's a usage and it's

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:33,660
richer if you take an example bakery I

00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:36,509
was present in just before is at the

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,240
time a room and also a bakery so it has

00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:41,519
a function being a shop and a structure

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,160
being a room so but why in the editor

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:49,410
you have clear preset it is both a room

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:52,440
and the shop so it's easy to edit and

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,079
last thing is that you have clear a year

00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,560
key in editing you don't edit everything

00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:01,319
at once you have a first after Street

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,750
mode view so you have access to the data

00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:07,310
but you just browse around so it's

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:10,110
mostly working like what view well dues

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,480
you can just browse around the map so

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,790
it's interesting you can see the data

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,800
level by in either and then you go to

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,199
the editing mode you can edit the

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,839
metadata of a single building saying

00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:25,170
this one as freely well for example and

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,779
you can edit one even at a time so you

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:30,209
can draw a flow of contour and then add

00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,670
features in this room so it's quite easy

00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:35,389
you only have what you want to see on

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,389
the map

00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:44,149
okay so we made it web-based because so

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:48,800
what you see here is that the change

00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:50,959
sets done mostly by ID editor then

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,800
followed by jaws I'm not surprising but

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:58,010
we think web-based is the better way to

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,320
go so our hypothesis is that it's easier

00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,000
because chasm you have to install on

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,130
your computer and it you have to be a

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,980
little bit more of an expert that's our

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:10,760
take on it and so we said it has to be

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:15,560
web-based and similar in usage like

00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:19,459
ideas so that was our take from from

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,170
these statistics there are some

00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,870
challenges specific to indoor mapping

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,839
you don't have when you map outdoors and

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:29,209
that is if you most of the buildings are

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,190
private that means you have restricted

00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:33,440
access you cannot go into any building

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,570
and just do the mapping if you go to an

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,860
airport and do that people will look

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:43,459
strangely at you probably it's hard to

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,019
get the floor plans because in many

00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:47,389
countries like in Germany there is

00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:49,040
copyright on them so you need the

00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:51,470
permission of the owner or the architect

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,430
in order to do something with them so

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,260
you need to consent but if you get them

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:01,360
it's really useful because then you can

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,360
use them as a blueprint and draw on it

00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:08,660
technically if you go in buildings you

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,540
lose GPS signal so outdoors you can use

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:15,380
GPS to record traces but indoors you

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:17,990
can't that's a little bit harder and in

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,690
general it's an editor with a two

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:24,050
dimensional view but you have to map

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,459
three dimensionally so that's a little

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,660
bit requires a little bit more of

00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:28,660
imagination I would say

00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:39,800
so the next step around this topic

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:41,960
I'm Amy involving the community I mean

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,190
we are using the simple in the tagging

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:48,290
which is a doing good job in most of our

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:51,110
time we have some corner case which

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:53,720
already have been discussed during our

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,600
project so we are still there so we can

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,330
still improve this tagging we can also

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,850
from our documentation because simple

00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,540
indoor tagging in general is not that

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,490
simple

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,680
so if you want to bring more people in

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,050
we need to document things to translate

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,650
the documentation so working on this

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:15,110
seems important to us we have also to

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,990
make indoor datasources easier to access

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,930
because of a legal restriction you are

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,780
talking about so we have to find ways to

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,240
maybe involve building operators in

00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:30,230
order to make them liberate the plans

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,930
from mapping so we have to imagine some

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,690
solution around this to make the raw

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:38,630
data we need to put in the data in

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:41,960
Westham accessible and then the editor

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,850
can also offer new features because it's

00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,910
still the first version so we can still

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:50,600
add more feature so maybe we can add a

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,900
3d preview of what you are doing when

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,960
editing so you can see the data in three

00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:59,800
dimensions who maybe it's more intuitive

00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:03,020
we can also think of showing indoor

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,030
geo-located images like the one from map

00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,640
scenario or open sweet camp so we have

00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,310
to find a way maybe to say these images

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,920
endure and this little so maybe we have

00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:17,000
to work with image provider to do visa

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,340
and also maybe think of tools of semi

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,860
automated mapping we have seen in the

00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,860
past some initiative like the Google one

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:27,560
with this device while you can move

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:31,490
around and have the world-building map

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,130
with lidar sensor so maybe we can think

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:36,410
of this kind of solution and how we can

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,840
integrate this in the OpenStreetMap

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,780
ecosystem so there are still things to

00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,550
do around this

00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,740
so if you are interested and want to

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,230
participate in this effort there are

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:52,830
many ways you can contributor so as a

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:55,410
mapper massage you can start create in

00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:58,200
the data so if you have a building a

00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:01,590
shopping mall train station whatever you

00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,710
can go on and start creating the data it

00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:07,440
will be easier with the editor you can

00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:09,570
also talk about indoor mapping with your

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,900
local community so that way it will

00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:15,570
interest more people we can also think

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,850
of reporting bugs a feature because you

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:21,540
are the users of the editor so you are

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:25,200
the people using it regularly so having

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:28,470
your feedback on how you feel about this

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,510
editor is always useful and we should

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,780
also continue promoting the indoor

00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:35,610
mapping so we are not still at full

00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,490
capacity on OpenStreetMap on these

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:41,160
topics we need to still continue doing

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,790
presentation doing talks about it and

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,390
then also help local groups launch

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,760
mapperton

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,980
and discuss with building apparatus so

00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,550
give give them the keys and

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:56,550
documentation to do so properly as a

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:59,280
developer you can for sure help by

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:02,670
contributing adding new features or fix

00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:05,970
existing existing bugs so you have links

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:08,400
to the repository on github and github

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,470
and then if you are interesting in

00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,570
translating the tool in order to bring

00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,540
in a Bridgette to more people worldwide

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:18,210
you can participate on transifex

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,100
and add your own wedge in video so it's

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,380
always useful for now it's only

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,270
available in English and French so it

00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:29,640
would be interesting to make it

00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:32,490
available in more languages and so don't

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:36,270
hesitate to try it and you can go to

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:39,530
this address and then maybe help us to

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,530
make it even better

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:55,810
[Applause]

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:58,800
we have ample time for questions over

00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,800
there thank you

00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:17,120
hi thanks for the talk you mentioned

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,880
that indoor navigation is difficult

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,890
without GPS or with bad GPS reception is

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,350
there any sort of provision for using

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,689
Wi-Fi signals like the competitors are

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,580
doing for indoor navigation so could you

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:30,500
track them map them into open street map

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,570
and if not is there like do you know of

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,960
any service that adds that or do you

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,130
think that's a good idea or not

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,480
well in general for in your navigation

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:44,920
you can use Wi-Fi I'm I don't know if

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:49,090
any open source indoor navigation

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:53,210
libraries available I think there are

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:56,090
some project but nothing really directly

00:17:53,210 --> 00:18:00,710
usable I'm not aware of it so and you

00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:04,400
can tag it in osm can you we can tag the

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:07,580
presence of a Wi-Fi spot and say it is a

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,890
shirt you would need SS IDs of all Y

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:14,060
files in the vicinity

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:17,540
Iannetta just regarding the wi-fi's

00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:20,000
there are two projects which map all the

00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,970
locations of Wi-Fi hotspots to the

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,790
coordinates one of them is what's it

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:28,250
called the open WLAN map but it's

00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:31,670
unfortunately the data set under the GPL

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:34,460
v2 which is not very commercially useful

00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:37,700
basically and the other one is to make

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:40,370
Mozilla's location service which also

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:44,150
does that but I'm not sure how much

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:46,340
alive it is can they just since I've got

00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:49,910
the mic already and I wanted to have a

00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:52,510
note on the last slide

00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:56,090
you mentioned transifex for translations

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:59,900
so transifex is and is a proprietary

00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:02,810
service what you can see that to change

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:05,060
into I deployed it or web later I would

00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,800
suggest web laid because it allows you

00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,810
to synchronize the translations with

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,750
gates so the translations get committed

00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:14,390
automatically by the translators without

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,850
them having to do conscious effort so

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:19,820
just it's it's free software and it's

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:22,670
better and for sure

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:25,520
we use the transifex because it allows

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:28,790
to manage one station for can source

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,670
repository for free for free no

00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:33,950
pneumonia I mean but if you want to

00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:37,130
switch to a novel solution I mean we are

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,590
open to it and we just need some people

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,570
giving effort to make this possible so

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,200
joy interesting to make the switch from

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:50,230
one to another you can help us and we'll

00:19:45,200 --> 00:20:02,150
do the switch for sure thank you much

00:19:50,230 --> 00:20:04,730
any further questions okay we just hi we

00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:07,820
are working in a campus map because I

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:10,220
work in a verse in Brazil and one of the

00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,350
features that is very difficult and are

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,760
now considering to upload our data or

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:18,680
have our buildings already mepid but one

00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,560
of difficult things is about the routing

00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:24,350
indoor like in a complex building if you

00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:28,130
have a lot of pets and elevators and the

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:30,650
stairs so are you thinking about tags

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:38,180
and structures to make roots in their

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:39,830
roots in answer sure I mean you know in

00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,800
the routing it's very important if you

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:45,440
want to build a navigation system and we

00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,790
have tried to make it simple to edit the

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:53,900
routing graphs so where people can walk

00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:56,450
also well three dimensions yeah that's

00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:00,020
the application point of view right you

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:03,590
would like to have it connected but and

00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:06,350
we have a example of people already are

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,570
doing indoor routing so it's possible

00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:12,590
even if we are mapping in two dimension

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:14,630
to have this 3d dimension routing so we

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,810
just have to adapt a bit the software in

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,760
order to make sense of the elevators a

00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,130
bit stairs and so on but it's

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,650
technically feasible it's something

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,710
which has been done and can be for sure

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,080
done in better at a better scale in the

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:34,669
future

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,669
so yeah I saw of question over there

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:47,580
yeah so I thought about doing data

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,919
validation because you should have for

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:53,940
mapping when you want to do rendering

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,559
it's you don't really need so much good

00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,700
quality but if you want to do the

00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:01,500
routine you need a lot better data I

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,330
think I think an editor could be really

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,260
good to do data validation on this have

00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:09,480
you thought about it we just took the

00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,149
perspective of what override eaters do

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,899
so it's just you can edit with data and

00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:19,679
there is no validation it's classical is

00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:22,019
what every details do but the what is

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,289
interesting with this editor is that you

00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:28,730
have tours to dewers for validation for

00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:31,289
example we met like few years ago

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:35,190
university confuse with some of my

00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:39,570
friends and we didn't solve at the door

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:43,649
which was like 19 metres larger because

00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:45,600
it was a program in the unit used with

00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:48,510
the editor I generally saw that the door

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,760
was too loud and so I can fix it so even

00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,880
if it's not already integrated there are

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,370
some small tools for validation and in

00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,000
the future we want to add more tools for

00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:02,519
validation like Johson do or like ideas

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,539
or starting to do so it's something we

00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:12,169
we want to have in our hood man okay

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:12,169
thanks any other group

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:26,220
thank you for great effort during this

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,950
editor and I have a question do you

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:32,040
consider any connection point with other

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:34,830
editors because when it's becoming that

00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,320
you edit some features in one editor it

00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:40,280
could be complete mess in another so

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,960
maybe did you have a discussion or

00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,450
duration how it could be in the future

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,210
suggest that this part of where you

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,800
better look in editor not ID but for

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:52,380
example in their mapping because it's

00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,840
levels and so on and second question

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,930
similar did you consider connection

00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,820
points in the OpenStreetMap rendering

00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,880
itself when it sells it can be very

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,040
cluttered when it's a lots of layers on

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,490
top of each other yeah in fact there has

00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:11,400
already some effort in this to do this

00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:14,400
because at some point I did this a small

00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,620
flock of ID but I wasn't wanting to

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,300
develop a fully detour I was thinking

00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:22,920
okay we can maybe improve existing

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:24,660
editors it was not the priority of the

00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,630
override the toast we integrate being da

00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,430
de be in da data and do program on

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,800
during so because there are many things

00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:34,170
to do on override it also I understand

00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,560
that it's not on the roadmap and doesn't

00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:40,590
make sense to develop this and Wow

00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,840
so there were some improvements on the

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,820
existing tool for example chosen which

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,940
integrates really well filtering for now

00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,980
we up there with this kind also of

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:54,270
support in ID it's not yet implemented

00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:56,250
and there was also a thought to push

00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:59,160
forward on the main run the ring of

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:02,490
OpenStreetMap but also the issue was

00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:05,400
closed yesterday and we don't want the

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:08,160
people maintaining this actually are not

00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,080
that much interested in the issue so

00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,050
maybe it's something we need to push

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,600
forward to to say ok this is coming

00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:18,950
Lindor data we derived we need to adapt

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:22,140
the the wall ecosystem to make it

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,690
consistent to make it openly rondelle

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,870
everywhere so i think we still need as a

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,190
community to do some work on this and

00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:32,190
where was the effort to do this in the

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,730
past well it's not yet done so we need

00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:36,929
to

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:38,880
pushing this for walk you are we get a

00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:42,020
close here so give a final round of

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,020
