Title: 2019: Observe - offline, cross-platform field mapping tool for OpenStreetMap
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day 1, Hörsaal Ost
Description: 
	Over the last few months, we’ve been building an offline first field mapping tool for the OpenStreetMap ecosystem called Observe. Observe makes field surveying, and verification easy for mappers, and works on iOS and Android. My talk will cover how Observe integrates with mapping workflows and helps improve OSM data from the field. I'll also touch upon fundamentals of building Observe and our assumptions on field mapping.

Field verification is an important part of keeping OSM data accurate. So far, field mapping exercises are largely manual, cumbersome, or requires internet connectivity. OpenStreetMap has an active mobile editing ecosystem, but they don't offer the same editing experience as iD for beginners. Most often mapping campaigns need an equally good tool that allows edits from the field to verify existing data and improve data quality.

Observe is a cross-platform, offline-first field mapping tool for OpenStreetMap, perhaps the first of its kind. Our primary goal was to build an application that makes field observation easy, and provide comparable experience to iD on Android and iOS — with some success. Observe focuses on browsing OSM data, and allows users to add new points, or verify existing information. The edits made offline are stored on the phone, and uploaded when the mapper goes online. Observe is a product of several iterations of user research and a couple of years of conceptualization. 

The talk will:

- introduce motivations behind building Observe
- look at some specific use cases in campaign management
- share internals of building the application
- discuss challenges around offline editing and our approach to conflict resolution
- gather feedback and launch a developer edition of the application

	00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,950
so we have a last tag talking this

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,230
session it's absurd

00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,570
offline cross-platform field mapping

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,520
tool for Pitt Street map and this talk

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:29,140
is giving by sea jet Anwar

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:30,890
so jet can you all hear me awesome

00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:36,620
thanks for being here

00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:38,239
this is this is many months in work in

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,140
progress so I'm really excited to show

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,390
you what we've been working on and you

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,610
know there are a lot of editors out

00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,910
there in OpenStreetMap and you know the

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,650
most familiar ones are ID and Josue so

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,390
there's gonna be a new one and hopefully

00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,340
you all like it and I'm here to take as

00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,710
many feedback as possible

00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,020
my name is Raja I work for a company

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,310
called development seed so if you don't

00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,610
know about the one seed we've been

00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,409
around for about 1516 years largely in

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,299
the international development

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,119
consultancy space we work with our

00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:14,240
partners to create new data to

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,189
OpenStreetMap build new tools so we get

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,079
our we get opportunities to build new

00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:21,170
tools that we can give back to the

00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:23,389
awesome ecosystem we also do a lot of

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,920
work with organizations like the

00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:28,009
humanitarian OpenStreetMap team where we

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,579
look at using large scale side of the

00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:32,990
ministry to build your math data and

00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:34,520
there are a few of us here from deaf

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,749
seed so if you want to learn more about

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,880
the work that we do please find us so

00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:42,409
today I want to talk to you guys about

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,450
something that we've been working on

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:49,819
called observe it's it's an offline

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,999
mobile editor for OpenStreetMap more

00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:56,569
like feel mapping tool works on both iOS

00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:58,880
and Android and I want to talk to you

00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:59,569
about how it works we've tried to do

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,779
differently

00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:04,579
the current ecosystem of field mapping

00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:05,569
tools and our Sam and you know we can

00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:09,229
take we can have a lot more

00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:11,599
conversations towards the end so a

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,750
little bit of history so we started

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,410
working on observe I think late 2016 and

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,240
in 2017 we came out with the version

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,730
along with with an organization called

00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,370
digital democracy anybody know or fans

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,340
of this yes

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:32,629
and the World Bank so observe back then

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:35,599
was the idea was observation so largely

00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:37,780
an awesome we try to map things that we

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,099
can actually verify and are more

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,510
non-temporal that exist for a really

00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,519
long time right

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,230
but you could observe things that could

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,269
be very temporal could be time-sensitive

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,599
could move on things like traffic things

00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:52,940
like you know this say whether this

00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,640
public tap had water at that point in

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,049
time and things like that so we wanted

00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,670
to try and attach these temporal

00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:01,250
information towards OpenStreetMap

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:04,780
features or just map them in general

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:07,250
just to collect more data from the field

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:10,970
so we released the first version kind of

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,819
a very basic first version and it failed

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,650
largely like is I think the things that

00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,319
we were trying to do especially with

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,579
cross-platform work the tools just

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,459
weren't ready at that point in time so

00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:24,019
we weren't really excited about the fact

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:25,159
that we're having to write to native

00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:27,170
apps so we don't want to write one for

00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:29,599
Android and iOS so we want to choose

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,389
something like vêoc native and I'll talk

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:37,130
about that later but eventually we kind

00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:39,590
of abandoned the project in 2017 but we

00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,090
kind of kept building on top we kept

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,730
looking at the progress of react native

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:47,599
and my box GL and tools like that and

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,910
then finally earlier this year we got

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:54,709
another opportunity to start building

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:56,090
more tools so observe is part of many of

00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,669
the awesome tools that we've been

00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,819
building and my colleague Mark will talk

00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:03,889
about some of the stuff tomorrow and the

00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:05,660
most recent ones are one is called

00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:07,790
scoreboard which is which is looking at

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,769
more analytics for managing mapping

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,849
teams and now some teams to sort of

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:16,039
build an API to have all the other tools

00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:18,829
around or some talk to each other with

00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:20,599
along with teams and organizations and

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,330
some of the other stuff is also listed

00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:25,820
up there on awesome power-ups calm so

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,660
observe kind of fits in the center a lot

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,580
of our partners work to generate new

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,610
awesome data to add it directly to

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,530
awesome but as well as have their own

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,090
or some like instances where they

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,430
collect sort of more temporal

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,009
information like the examples that I

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,050
gave before so these tools kind of fit

00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:46,939
squarely within the OSM ecosystem and

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,710
gets used to by other people also so we

00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:54,560
cannot get feedback from both parties

00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:57,139
which is gay so let's talk so how many

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,729
of you guys have used Oh some on your

00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:03,919
phone wow that's amazing

00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:09,199
how many of you have edited or some on

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,639
your phone that is also amazing so so

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,050
we'll talk a bit about the existing

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,419
ecosystem and I think there are really

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,490
cool apps out there so if any of you

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,110
haven't tried any of these I strongly

00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,789
recommend you have to have at least one

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:24,500
of these on your phone before you leave

00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:26,419
the conference so so overall the

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,159
breakdown is there's there are a couple

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:30,199
of editors that are very specific to

00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:32,270
features so there is fire react which is

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,240
like only looking at like fire hydrants

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:38,539
the street complete which is sort of

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,270
micro tasking only interested in new

00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:46,129
attributes to streets then there is

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:47,599
Vespucci awesome and kind of have vests

00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:50,629
which is kind of like very focused

00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:53,620
editing only on Android and then there's

00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:56,060
master male awesome and which tries to

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,889
which are both sort of navigation apps

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,550
primarily and then allow people to add

00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:04,789
more data as the one so and then this go

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,469
Mac which is great on iOS the UI could

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,300
be a little better but I think it still

00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:14,409
kind of is a very powerful editor on the

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:16,909
phone so largely what we've seen is a

00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:19,689
primary use case has always been towards

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:22,430
like either a single platform or

00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:24,589
navigation and multi platform we wanted

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,210
to do like something that has editing

00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:29,150
and field verification capability on

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:32,360
both and has can offer a sort of this

00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,550
similar experience like ID or has a

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,710
lower entry to barrier right and also

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:40,759
has very familiar interface that people

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:44,899
can get started quickly we also wanted

00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:47,029
to be able to customize easily so you

00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,680
know things like restrict presets to a

00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:49,600
certain

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,580
all set so people don't make mistakes or

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,490
you don't want you don't want to confuse

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,110
people with too many things or be able

00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,880
to sort of plug into different kinds of

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,380
our some instances so there are projects

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,880
like Tito Assam which want to encourage

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,250
learning awesome in the classroom or the

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,990
projects like open historical map they

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,310
are mapping more historical and temporal

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,030
features so you want to be able to point

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,470
the app to different or some api's so

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,280
those are the kind of primary things

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:21,340
that that were in our mind and you could

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,880
technically fork many of these and make

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,400
it happen

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:28,330
but you wouldn't still get the same

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,639
experience on both the platforms so so

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:34,240
we were until I started looking at what

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,889
we had in 2017 you still order we used a

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,180
lot of the design elements and then

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:41,410
start a building observe I'll kind of

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,300
walk through some of the features and

00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,310
then or take sort of more technical

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,759
questions towards the end so now it

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:51,250
works on Android and iOS it's not on the

00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:54,520
App Store for Android you can download

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,840
an apk from github and I can send you

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,630
the link later and it's also on the

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,070
presentation when I ask the sort of the

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,690
provisioning is slightly more complex

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,750
but you have to get in touch one with

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,460
one of us we also haven't created a

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,860
production instance so you can't really

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,960
edit the main over some instance just

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,970
yet because we want to be very careful

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,349
we want to make sure that people are on

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,659
board with this idea and get more

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:18,659
feedback and have enough time for decid

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:25,000
we borrowed a lot of things and a lot of

00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:26,949
cool ideas from ID I'm also a great fan

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,710
of the idea code base we've I've also

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:31,720
worked on our code base so we we

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,940
borrowed preset straight up so UK it's

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,950
pretty much a drop-in thing so every

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:40,150
time ID updates new presets you can just

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:42,370
copy that in to observe it also is an

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:45,190
easy way to sort of remove things that

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,880
you don't want to for people to allow

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,950
editing in the in the mobile app so at

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,649
the moment the current version of

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,630
observer can only do Pio eyes so you can

00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:59,040
only add points so there are only four

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:04,680
point supported presets available

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:06,630
in in observe the primary thing we

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,810
wanted to do is to build a really good

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:12,720
offline editor so what you see is just

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,509
here like a video of how someone would

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,180
download an area so you could go and

00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:20,310
select an area and hit download what

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,319
this does is it downloads the base map

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,420
child it downloads satellite imagery

00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:27,540
tiles and it downloads the or some data

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,550
and then stores that on disk we also do

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,620
several cool thanks to make sure you

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,050
know if there's been an if you try to

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,579
edit one particular tile on the map then

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,680
we kind of refresh just that tile

00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:39,990
instead of refreshing the whole area and

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,699
so on and so forth so you can assume

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,350
that every time you go online there's

00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:50,430
something happening that kind of keeps

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:51,959
the data a fresh a lot of time went into

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,899
making sure it's kind of a familiar

00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,389
interface it largely looks like a web

00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:01,560
map with some buttons on it so which

00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:04,170
we've all kind of seen so you can go to

00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,870
the add point mode plates select where

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,850
you on the point find a preset and then

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,029
add any details you want and then you're

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,029
done

00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,839
you can also switch the layers they

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,310
start so whether you want the base map

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,959
or you want to see the salary misery to

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:24,300
verify something that you're seeing on

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:26,190
the down I think one of my favorite

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,199
features for observe is to be able to

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,880
easily edit attributes of existing

00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:31,290
features so when you're walking around

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,019
or going to a restaurant you want to be

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,209
able to add opening hours or phone

00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,920
numbers or in case you know that

00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:40,110
restaurant doesn't exist anymore so you

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,199
want to update that information so you

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,089
can do that there are lots of fields you

00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:52,399
can add new fields you can add custom

00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:54,420
tags as you as you would like so

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,699
uploading contribution so when you're

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,279
working offline all the edits are stored

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:01,019
on device they'll be stored to disk when

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,970
you close the app and then will be pull

00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,970
back up when you're looking at the app

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,290
again and when you come online they'll

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,230
start queuing up for uploads

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,710
automatically and we intend to change

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,600
that automatic up

00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,640
soon so you have better control over

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,700
what you want to applaud and knock and

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,380
then if some uploads kind of fail you

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,779
have an option to retry and sort of look

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,570
at what exactly fail and what you want

00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:27,130
to do afterwards I think one of the

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,310
biggest feedback that we got when we

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,290
launched a few months ago was so right

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,270
now each edit goes into a single chain

00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,070
set so we have better control on the

00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,020
phone set as well as in case people make

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,670
mistakes you can just revert a single

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,310
chain set so I think we plan to make

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,550
that sort of a batch edit into one chain

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,550
sir

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,480
another thing we try to do is to have

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,930
some sort of basic conflict management

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,190
and this comes from a lot of our

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:58,540
conversations with people who go out in

00:11:54,190 --> 00:12:01,029
the field especially who have teams

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,430
working in the same area and doing

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:06,459
several rounds of field work over and

00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,709
over so sometimes I go to the same place

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:11,050
which may have been visited by somebody

00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:12,670
else and were both offline and we may

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,130
have both added different kinds of data

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,050
and you kind of get an opportunity to

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,000
decide which one you want to keep so

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,270
this is very basic right now it doesn't

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,170
do it doesn't actually do any conflation

00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:28,300
it just gives you an option to say there

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,610
is a conflict you're welcome to override

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,310
yours or you can decide a relator state

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:36,370
so you don't have to upload so there's

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,860
no automatic overwriting there's no

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,570
assumption of whose is correct and who's

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,240
not it kind of leaves it up to the

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,190
mapper to decide what's best so in the

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,709
end when you when the fieldwork is

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,080
complete and you go back there's still

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:56,110
an opportunity to conflate with other

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:57,520
tools that are available at OSF stew

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:03,000
cannulae talked a little bit about how

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:06,220
were storing data in on the phone so we

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,630
store everything as do JSON which you

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,570
know many of you would agree that not

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,520
the best way to store all of our Sam for

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,050
a particular area on a phone but

00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,600
surprisingly a lot of phones are really

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,670
good and we're able to store everything

00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,279
on this can fetch based on tiles that

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,280
you're looking at so imagine just like

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,710
how you do your web Maps you kind

00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,040
and then Lord as you need so we're kind

00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:32,190
of using the same principles so we use

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,200
awesome to JSON convert them into JSON

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,460
kind of we have a fork that sort of

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,680
starts tracking the relationships

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,830
because we want to be able to edit ways

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,590
in the future

00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:48,510
wheels react native anybody here use

00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:53,280
react native before okay cool I I don't

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:55,620
know if I can recommend but it's I mean

00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,780
it's a really cool software dome and kit

00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,550
but it requires a lot of patience

00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,370
because there's very little

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:06,930
documentation things change so fast so

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:09,450
often but I think the I think being able

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,310
to deploy right once and deploy for both

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,920
Android and iOS with very comparable

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,710
experience is actually very rewarding so

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,380
if you all if anybody is trying to go in

00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,840
this route I would recommend give it a

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:25,770
shot but if you know don't have so much

00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:29,010
patience in time don't do it map of GL

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:31,440
map out CL has sort of native native

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:34,260
bindings for both Android and iOS and

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,110
there's a react native a community

00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:43,589
maintained react native fork for map out

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:46,560
shell which is great so I think we got a

00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:50,250
lot of questions about like why would I

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,530
use observed why why did you build it so

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,230
I think some of the use cases so I've

00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,120
been mapping a lot of P wise it's

00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,990
actually very easy you walk around you

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,390
know open at a point move on you can

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,950
verify existing features so when you go

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,570
to a new town or you are checking out a

00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,610
new restaurant you can make sure that

00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,050
place actually exists and some of the

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,850
there are lots of tricks you can use so

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,760
when you pull up a particular feature

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:17,120
you can see when it was added so you

00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,040
know you can decide whether what kind of

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,110
edits you want to make you can also

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,760
build a custom version of observe to

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,560
focus on the feature that you really

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,589
want so I encourage people who are

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,950
interested in doing field service to try

00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:35,740
it out lots of things are work in

00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:38,860
progress we want to be able to edit ways

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,180
we will not be supporting relations and

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:44,080
we'll try to figure out a middle ground

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:48,040
without you know having a lot of trouble

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:50,830
getting at waste edits we want to enable

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,170
sort of GPS recording so you can turn

00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,720
them into ways later jasm or something

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,950
else most often people want to take

00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,600
pictures so they can add additional

00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:02,530
information when they are back from the

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,170
field so support for photos better

00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,880
restrictions to precess it would be cool

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,860
to integrate certain campaigns from task

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,620
manager directly to observe so you can

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,600
finish the sort of the armchair mapping

00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,900
remote mapping and then have that

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,610
verified on the field do more temporal

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,290
service so we're going to build a small

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,200
lightweight API that allows you to

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,540
attach temporal data tags to or some

00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,330
features and so to keep that keep that

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,950
going and then integrate teams and

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:35,530
hopefully that comes from desk managers

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:38,890
well please go have a look it's on

00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:40,660
github and I can also show you so

00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,550
there's some of us who have it on our

00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,920
phones if you are an Android you should

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:49,300
already be able to download and install

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,770
if you're and I always come find me we

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,950
also have a couple of other talks if you

00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,950
wanna

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,770
awesome and then we'll talk about more

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,870
of the tools later so the zip off at

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,030
4:30 and there's a tarp at 5:00 tomorrow

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:11,290
and that's my email if you want to get

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,290
in touch thank you

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:27,179
thank you very much we have time for

00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:27,179
questions anybody there we go

00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:33,220
if we're interested in adding new POS

00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,929
just to the general version would you

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,970
recommend just trying to make our own

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,470
fork and add those or is there somewhere

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,259
we should request that like a github

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:45,340
issue like pharmacy is for example yeah

00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:48,669
so right now we've tried to include most

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,850
of the PU eyes but it's actually pretty

00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:53,619
straightforward to drop in the ID JSON

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:59,470
preset JSON and I think the next version

00:17:53,619 --> 00:18:02,970
will have all the presets any further

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:07,110
question coffee is not yet ready I guess

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,110
so make use of the time

00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:31,360
[Applause]

00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:34,040
Thanks Thanks I was wondering about the

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,020
points of interests represented only as

00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,420
nodes I can understand why you don't

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,940
want to build editing and yet for more

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,250
complex features like multi polygons but

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,020
do you have any way of warning users

00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,480
that something might already be mapped

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,640
either as aware as a multi polygon or

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,230
something like that so they don't

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:56,570
duplicate it yeah so I've been talking

00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,340
with Brian about this specific field so

00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:02,510
and how I did us especially because of

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:04,790
the filters I think I think it the next

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,640
version when we introduced we're editing

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:09,440
we will try to limit that so you would

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,330
have to go into a mode where you only

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,130
edit ways and at that point we'll try to

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,230
warn people based on the types that

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:18,200
they're trying to edit so if there are

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,150
approximate the perhaps of what would

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,820
what they're trying to add it has very

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,530
close proximity other features will

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,290
still have all the features on the phone

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:32,870
so either the base map or the proximity

00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:38,050
we could try to warn something any

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:41,120
further questions I just give you my mic

00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:47,660
so do you have a plan to get it into the

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:50,720
App Store's anytime soon so we don't

00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,540
have any plans but if there's interest

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,950
we would really like to do it so if

00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,500
there are more people interested in

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,510
using and one have it on their phones we

00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,400
would we would definitely try to make it

00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,170
happen but also if there are other

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,140
people who are interested in actually

00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:14,050
hosting this on the App Store I would be

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:18,740
very happy to help any further questions

00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:21,590
that's good because I have one you you

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,620
you showed how when you go to a certain

00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,600
area you download a particular data set

00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,640
so you have it in the background but

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,650
then in the animation you showed that I

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,840
can change into the satellite imagery is

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,920
this part of what you pre download

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,920
before you go into the field

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:42,930
the download once and when you download

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,000
it down when you request for download it

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,920
downloads the base map the satellite

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:54,180
image styles and the awesome data as a

00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:58,280
single pack anybody else everybody's

00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:01,869
ready for coffee nope over there sorry

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,869
[Music]

00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:13,620
yes so right now it's a bit arbitrary I

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:17,159
think the limitation is like like four

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:20,010
hundred square kilometers but also you

00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:24,029
know nobody really wants to have so much

00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:25,500
data on the phone but that we captured

00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:27,840
sort of auditory because we want to

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,149
evaluate how much data you can actually

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,779
download successfully but we might

00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:34,889
change that when we add way editing

00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:37,110
functionality so then it would be a much

00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:39,000
smaller area but you could have many

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:44,789
smaller areas and there'll be a way to

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,659
manage that somehow you know whether I'd

00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:53,100
like to ask about downloading the region

00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:57,929
do you use the standard map box or

00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:02,730
flying a region that box provides the if

00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:08,429
yes have you done anything specific so

00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:11,700
that the download is fast enough we've

00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:14,029
done a couple of things so when you if

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,529
you pan the map through that area before

00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:18,990
we've kind of already added your cache

00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:20,940
so we don't try to redownload unless

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,870
it's been a long time so there's a cache

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,090
expiry we also rely on the native SDKs

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,250
offline packs so we try to add the

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,320
satellite and the awesome tiles as part

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,139
of the same pack so you can manage so

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,480
when you remove you know you don't go

00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:38,250
out of sync so when you remove something

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,149
it clears everything and then you can

00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:45,480
download back when you want so yeah it's

00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:52,230
it's you you you you have used the cache

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:55,710
but with you so you use actually the MB

00:22:52,230 --> 00:23:05,309
GL cache that's right okay thank you

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:06,029
okay anybody else missing anybody no I

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:08,909
guess not

00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:10,590
okay then enjoy your coffee but please

00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:13,039
give a final round of applause to our

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,039
