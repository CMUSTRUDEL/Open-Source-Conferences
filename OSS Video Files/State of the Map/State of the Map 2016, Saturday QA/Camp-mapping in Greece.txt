Title: Camp-mapping in Greece

Description: 
	Henk Hoff and Katja Ulbert at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/campmapping-in-greece/

The Red Cross is mapping migrant camps in Greece. The project entails some basic infrastructure mapping of the various camps (based on recent aerial imagery), from which we we will work together with migrants in the camps to further enrich the map with detailed, relevant information. These maps will be used for interaction of parties active in the camps to engage with the people living there. And of course, can also be used by migrants amongst each other.

The presentation will cover why we started this project, how we have set it up and how we are using the map in our work. Realizing the approach being similar to what Mapfugees have done in Calais, both organizations are now in contact with each other to further work on the implementation of the mapping-by-migrants phase.

so let me know introduce our first

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,629
speaker Hank from red cross

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,480
international and Katya from

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:12,170
humanitarian OpenStreetMap team and I

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,379
will give the frost to them right now

00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:20,180
thank you very much good morning good

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:26,490
morning at least in my time zone welcome

00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:28,019
first a little bit of so we both so

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,500
that's Katya from human terrible sweet

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,910
lab team and we from the International

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,809
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,820
organization societies I just I'll just

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:43,399
name it Red Cross I hope that you'll

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:47,879
hope feel that that's okay we both did

00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:52,440
an idea or a DM to attempt to map cams

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:55,230
in the refugee price during the refugee

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,910
crisis and both attempts are slightly

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:02,879
little bit different because in the back

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,479
vog project it was mainly trying to map

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:11,369
a informal camp in calera you probably

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,400
already bout it and we're trying to do

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,979
some mapping of Afghans that our

00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,060
official formal camps so and at some

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,650
point I was kind of thinking like it

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,080
would be nice to just compared it to

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:28,229
because if they have different kind of

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:31,439
dynamics what to do with it so I first

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,950
want to just give the floor to I would

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,409
say very successful project yeah from

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,070
hot who's running their back for eg

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,490
project and she's going quickly too

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:50,660
anyhow they set up the whole project how

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:52,940
it worked and then after is I'll be

00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,790
coming back and talk a little bit more

00:01:52,940 --> 00:02:00,170
about what we as the Federation have

00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:02,509
done for mapping in Greece sorry about

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,090
that it's all it's all it's all to keep

00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:08,149
you awake because I know saturday is a

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,530
difficult day you've all been out doing

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:14,720
whatever you've been doing on a friday

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:20,030
nights and it's so there see how we can

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:28,489
get up to the other presentation with it

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:31,630
so if you want to go and what I'll just

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:39,110
need to get this colorway tell about the

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:42,970
project okay thank you I good morning so

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:46,850
as I was kindly introduced by Hank and

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:50,810
this is about to participatory mapping

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:52,489
projects 12 place in Dunkirk and one

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,760
took place in cali these are too

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:58,519
informal cams the camp and Kelly is semi

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,660
organized semi-state run and the camp in

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:06,350
cali is not run by any NGO and also not

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:09,170
run by the state they're pretty much

00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:12,920
located to you if you can see um and

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:16,910
they're located at the border to the UK

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:20,959
and also need to Belgium and there are

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:23,660
reasons why people are here yeah mainly

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,390
this this image pretty much sums it up

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,240
by their here they want to go to the UK

00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:34,640
and they cannot do so in a legal

00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:37,130
so they take alternative routes let's

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,450
call it like that so they tried to jump

00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:44,450
on Lori's to sneak into cars and to

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:48,260
cross the borders oh it's also possible

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:52,550
to do it by paying people for taking

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,710
them there and most of them are fleeing

00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:58,700
war and conflict and they come from very

00:03:54,710 --> 00:04:01,760
poor countries are they experienced

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:05,330
ethnic or political oppression and their

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,660
home countries and the evolution of the

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:14,170
camp's both are pretty new camps Dunkirk

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:19,010
was makeshift camp that originated in

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:23,330
summer 2015 and the conditions were

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:25,400
really unacceptable so MSF decided at

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,160
the beginning of this year to construct

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,490
the camp with their own money according

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,980
to humanitarian standards it has a very

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:39,950
homogenic population mostly people from

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:42,230
Kurdistan from Iraq Iran Syria and there

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:46,130
is a large number of families in this

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:48,820
camp about twenty percent many many kids

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,350
running very fast on their bikes and

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:55,940
also a small number of unaccompanied

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:58,580
minors yeah this is an aerial image of

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:02,590
the capsule you can really see it's

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:05,570
nicely designed very well structured and

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,080
while the camp in cali is a real make

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:12,170
sure that can be spontaneous camp and

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,440
people started am gathering there last

00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:18,340
year and spring and half of the camp was

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,500
evicted at the beginning of this year

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,680
the french state is present with the

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,290
container camper 1,500 people by now

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,490
there are 10,000 residents and numbers

00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:33,630
arising thousand unaccompanied minors

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:38,700
and the population

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:41,130
so very mixed origin so I think the

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:44,090
largest communities are from Afghanistan

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:48,450
Sudan and many people coming now from

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:51,960
Ethiopia and also Roma people every tree

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:54,360
is another country and then yeah smaller

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,660
populations from Pakistan Kurdish people

00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,390
Syria and since sometime also Egyptian

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,720
and Palestinian people ninety-eight

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,610
percent in this camp are man and as I

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,590
said it's continuously growing and

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,920
especially the number of unaccompanied

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:14,100
minors coming to the camp is varying

00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:19,860
while I was there july that were about

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:22,440
10 new miners arriving each day um both

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,110
as i already said the camp in dunkirk is

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,600
seeming organized there many volunteer

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:31,770
organizations present but also NGOs are

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,800
responsible for something like health

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:40,070
are also watched the sanitary conditions

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:43,620
are very good compared to cali which is

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:47,070
mainly volunteer also refugee one there

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,320
is a the many refugee community leaders

00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,470
who are really taking responsibility for

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:55,080
what's going on in the camp they have

00:06:52,470 --> 00:07:01,620
regular coordination meetings with NGOs

00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:04,320
and volunteer organizations NGOs present

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:08,340
in the camp are acted with two people

00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:11,160
MSF runs a youth center and MDM offers

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,830
psychosocial support and as I said the

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,150
French government provides three

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:20,850
thousand meals a day and runs the

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:24,000
container camp so the infrastructure in

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,580
Dunkirk is really better they have no

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,270
public tricity but street lamps and

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:34,500
public Wi-Fi and colors you can see this

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:37,920
is yeah usual place in cali so it

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,560
doesn't get they have an unselfish and

00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,950
waste management which is a major

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,440
problem there so this is what looks like

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:52,200
and how the noon dunkirk are really

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:54,330
beautiful msf boxes and in cali people

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,870
are the new arrivals are sleeping rough

00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:02,430
most of the time there are small chance

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:06,570
like this one self good structures a mix

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:10,110
of MSF boxes caravans mostly for

00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:12,390
families and the container camps the

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:16,950
data situation we face in Dan group was

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:19,230
no geodata and no up-to-date imagery we

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,180
had some CAD files and i'm in cali

00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,880
there's this one hand drawn map and

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,240
there are three info bullets and then

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:30,270
there are three active maps um and we

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:34,440
had some data from you map so the

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:36,870
outreach we did at very central spaces

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,770
and Dan group we were located at the

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:44,850
refugee Welcome Center and which is here

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:46,710
which in cali we had a kind of three

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,380
methods of reaching people so we had a

00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,690
headquarter at jungle box which is a

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:55,200
very popular place and then we had

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:58,970
temporary headquarters to reach smaller

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,490
communities and mobile mapping teens

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:07,290
this is jungle books this is an example

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:10,140
of our temporary headquarters and this

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,480
is yeah what mobile Mac King looks like

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,220
so we were just recruiting people who

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,190
were walking by asking them if they

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,030
wanted to map with us the tools we used

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:24,620
her yeah very simple it was few papers

00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:27,810
drawing governments and mapping on

00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,320
smartphones so in dunkirk we were able

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:33,200
to walk people through complete workflow

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,350
they had a strong learning curve and

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,350
they really build up their capacities

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,840
and reactivated their skills was a lot

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,850
of working collecting traces a lot of

00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,460
fuel paper ring and then getting the

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,790
data editing and jazz

00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,070
them and in the end it was an open

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,350
street map and Kelly it was totally

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:57,770
different and because there was a high

00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:01,070
fluctuation of people attending and but

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:03,770
we got them involved by creating their

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,140
own Maps drawing them so this is what it

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,700
looks like in the yent this is the

00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,030
container camber we didn't have access

00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:14,180
to but there were nice refugee matters

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:16,760
who did that for us and they created it

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,700
for example color code so this guy's 16

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,710
years old Idris from Ethiopia and he did

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,110
this just on his own we didn't influence

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,890
him in any way and I think he really got

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:30,470
the point of a pretty good map and then

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,450
we had several games and just to find

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,330
out what other points of reference and

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:38,120
how do people structure their daily life

00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:41,210
and we did all the chem translations

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,330
together with them in total there were

00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:46,460
six languages and we just attach the

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,160
maps basically everywhere jungle our

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,560
radio our classroom and also at the

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,140
captain church and the points of

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,440
interest in area of interests ever in

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,990
both camps distribution points

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:03,190
educational facilities and also the free

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:06,440
shops where they could get free food

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:10,760
like the snack shack very popular very

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:13,070
good food and yes Sam and Kelly and they

00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,710
had just much more restaurants and like

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:19,100
this one then communal kitchens the

00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:21,760
afrin kitchen refugee info bus with free

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,040
Wi-Fi the Welcome van for new arrivals

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,090
another school the church of course is

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,530
the point of interest and mosque and

00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,810
yeah and for bother a lot of sport

00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,400
activities going on and this is an

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,530
interesting point of interest because

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:40,570
it's the embankment in there and they

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:44,540
have good data connection the challenges

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:46,760
in both camps were the same so presence

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,339
of police police rates spontaneous

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:53,290
fights breaking out

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:55,120
in the presence of mafia and gangs for

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,100
people who don't know what this is these

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,910
are chicas canisters which are

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:04,839
especially in Calais yeah police use

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:07,269
them and seem to like them and so the

00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,339
challenge for individual mappers is of

00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:12,550
course I mean need to be very resilient

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:15,430
self aware of what's going on and where

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:18,309
of what's going on around you flexible

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:22,110
and you should be you should have

00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:26,860
physical and mental health so just alive

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:30,069
so the outcome in practical terms was of

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:33,339
course the data on Adam and we had

00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:36,100
physical service maps and smaller maps

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:39,970
for handouts and we also created a

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:43,180
surroundings map and a basket buzz guide

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:47,709
both was requested by the refugees so in

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:51,300
cali also data on razem and physical

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:53,679
maps one general camp map and one map

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:58,389
especially for the miners which was

00:12:53,679 --> 00:13:00,699
requested by MSF so that it then we were

00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:03,069
supported by really great organizations

00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:05,620
can I foundation bibliothèque from

00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:08,019
quantile which the logo is not really

00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,809
yeah it doesn't look very good Matt box

00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:14,050
provided at with imagery thanks very

00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:15,910
much and metal Aruba's technical

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,429
equipment and of course we had a lot of

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,649
volunteers and remote contributors from

00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:23,829
openstreetmap specially openstreetmap

00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:26,800
fans and many missing Maps volunteers

00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:28,600
from the UK and of course wouldn't have

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,639
been possible without all the refugee

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,639
members thank

00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:46,170
thank you very much um I really love

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:50,940
this project because it's it also kind

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:54,779
of triggered us when we were talking

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,660
about we want to have maps from camp how

00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,960
should we do that and the map Fugees

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:06,810
project really proved idea we can do

00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:12,540
that together with oh okay so we can do

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:16,410
that together with with with refugees so

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:18,120
a little bit backgrounds for as a little

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,500
bit of background on how the Red Cross

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,029
is a little bit structured because it

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,390
gives a little bit of idea so we have

00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:28,380
190 Red Cross and Red Crescent

00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,860
organizations in the various countries

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,930
and they are basically doing most of the

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,790
work we have a federation where I'm

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:40,230
currently working for which is

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:42,540
supporting the national Red Cross and

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,870
Red Crescent organizations if there's

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,720
extra need we try to help in and there's

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:52,650
also than the ICRC which basically

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:56,130
covers if there's any form of conflict

00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:59,850
situations so if you see in Syria next

00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:02,970
to the Syrian Arabic Red Crescent

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,880
organization also see the ICRC trying to

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:10,770
get food into Aleppo and not and these

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,720
kind of organizations we work along the

00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,010
seven fundamental principles you can

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,790
look it up on the website if it's

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:19,500
interesting and but but but the reading

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,560
Carroll gives we want to be independent

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,510
we really work with volunteers because

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,000
we really try to engage with local

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:28,980
communities making them stronger and

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,459
also then the Federation here is says

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:36,720
we're trying to help support the local

00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:40,350
national Red Cross organizations ok back

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,390
to quickly where we are refugees and if

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,920
you look at the various camps in Greece

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,270
because I'm not trying to focus on

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,940
Greece this is either many

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:51,250
is closed by now but this was in many at

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,740
some of the heights of the when we had

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,680
about ten thousand people there it kind

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,390
of so if you go to it if you're from a

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,190
little bit of distance kind of feels

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,350
like a festival camping that kind of

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:05,020
thing but if you really look if you're

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:09,640
really into it it's it's a little bit

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:11,980
more I think the word is sad especially

00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,070
for instance if it's raining it's just

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,630
it's not it's not the place to be and

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,000
also you see children there that kind of

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,490
thing so that was kind of horrible now

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,970
we see way much more different cans cans

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,830
popping up because the flow has stopped

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,360
the d'abord the borders has closed so we

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,420
need to look a little bit more like

00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,690
long-term this is in cordelia oasis in

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:38,320
the north of greece near near

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:40,480
thessaloniki another one is near is near

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,880
kavala that's also the north you see

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,070
another tensor kind of thing interesting

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,440
about this picture is you one of the

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,080
things that you miss which is very

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:55,120
important that kind of have in summer is

00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:57,550
trees lots of these cams and grease or a

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,740
military property this is on an Air

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:02,350
Force Base you cannot understand where

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,480
there's not many trees up there but if

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:07,709
so if it's summer you can understand

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,790
it's pretty rough place to be there

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:15,310
another one red sauna it's north of

00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:18,250
north of athens again lots of tens of

00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:20,410
that kind of thing and the last bit is

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,970
last one that he is kind of mangoes

00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,970
which is also now near to

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:31,580
athens a see here you see more of these

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:32,690
container comes which do have air

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,520
conditioning that kind of thing in it

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,340
here you see also the activity that

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,980
we're trying to do there to do do some

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,919
hygiene promotion with clowns and a car

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:46,130
thing to teach people that they need to

00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,779
wash their hands that t need to book the

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,190
garbage in the car beje cans and that

00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:52,460
kind of thing to reuse time stay healthy

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:56,000
okay we did basically now we just over

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,429
three slides we did it kind of thing we

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,039
try to do it in two phases phase one

00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:05,059
really trying to get error imagery to do

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,710
some structural mapping of uh yeah

00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:10,640
you're going to be up here in a short

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:13,029
min and just drag me out of it sorry to

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,220
do it is kind of structural image

00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:19,820
mapping that we can trace the containers

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:22,429
and tents and that kind of thing we kind

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,890
of learned that not always a recent

00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:27,140
error injury as was available or imagery

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,120
was available but you had clouds or lots

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,380
of trees that kind of not really was

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,080
helpful but since cams are pretty small

00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,990
we could be easily get it done so this

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,760
is skyler mangas i told you what it is

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,880
it's just nice buildings cam structure

00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,710
this is Heather sauce also the north so

00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:50,240
these kind of things are on the map the

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:51,620
phase two this is the last slide so the

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,830
facts do that we wanted to do is just

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,360
get the local community the migrants who

00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,480
are living in these cams involved and

00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,909
get all the info all the nice POS and

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,039
their car thing on the map itself what

00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:06,409
do they feel is important to be on the

00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:09,830
map and they can maintain the day can

00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:13,669
also keep the map update it so for so

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:15,950
for that we wanted to look a group of

00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:18,799
local osm volunteers who can help train

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:20,240
people and we found these in a group

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,059
volunteers from the hackerspace heck

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,120
space in greece and you'll definitely

00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:28,820
know these people because dorothea she's

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,679
up there she's one of the people that

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,840
and she's now also hired as the admin

00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,940
for the Oak Street Map foundation so

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,720
accent so I think the Overstreet my

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,159
foundation did a very good job in hiring

00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,720
so we're really happy with that then

00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,379
it's also kind of thing that we have

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,480
local stuff so we can only advise the

00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:49,190
Hellenic or the great correct cross like

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,870
in we want to do these car things so we

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,690
also need to try and convince these kind

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,820
of things and you sometimes have

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,649
difficulties like well yeah well people

00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,210
live here so they kind of know where

00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:03,019
things are so why do you want to put it

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:05,330
on the map it's really necessary so

00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:08,659
that's a slight problem we need to

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,669
overcome but thirdly I also see that it

00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:14,029
is pretty difficult in a formal camp

00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:16,399
because we need to get access to people

00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:19,309
to get on the map we do not run the camp

00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:20,690
so we every time that we bring people on

00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:23,659
to the camp we need to ask for access

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,100
and permission to be there on it so we

00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:27,619
went there like hey we have this great

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,200
group of people want to teach them to to

00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:33,529
map and then they kind of thing like Oh

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,889
map I don't know again like I said most

00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:38,539
of the camps are military properties

00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:41,450
military are millet militaries and

00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:44,720
mapping things are not really the nice

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:48,399
combining stuff so that's a little bit

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,570
of problematic down so the second phase

00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:53,809
with trills still trying to figure out

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:58,549
how we can do that ah but it's a little

00:20:53,809 --> 00:21:01,070
bit difficult so I hope come to the

00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:03,409
conclusion we're trying to figure it out

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,090
well maybe we're going get the

00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:10,039
experience and maybe look at different

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:11,269
countries but if but anyways this is a

00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:13,850
nice experience that we wanted to do

00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:17,679
really committed and trying to make it

00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:20,570
together with the local communities and

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,570
unfortunately we were not completely

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:27,889
successful in what we initially planned

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:29,480
but anyways we keep hope and hopefully

00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:32,289
next time we can do a little bit more

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,289
thank

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,670
Thank You Hank Thank You cat yeah sorry

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,580
for rushing you but we would like to

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:47,040
take to keep time for a few questions so

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,890
I think we can take two questions if

00:21:47,040 --> 00:22:00,840
there is anybody interested please raise

00:21:49,890 --> 00:22:02,040
your hand hello I'm here okay thank you

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,660
for your presentation these

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,900
representations were really interesting

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:09,480
but I was one I just wanted to ask you

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,360
about when you work with the communities

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,860
how because you are speaking that you

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,950
want to put people on the map and then

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,620
they say just what does this add to us

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,210
or how would that change I'm asking

00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,190
about this discussion because I think

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,200
it's pretty crucial and one Cathy I was

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,390
picking in the very in the first place I

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,520
think that map the mapping that you're

00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:34,680
working on is pretty political and this

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,130
political aspect has to be emphasized in

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,990
a way when like I don't know how do you

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,900
emphasize it when you speak with the

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:45,660
people that it's not only about mapping

00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,750
where they are but mapping also how do

00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:52,290
they live and those conditions those

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:56,280
inhuman conditions in a way and also

00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:58,800
this mapping as as a protest you know

00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:02,820
like as a saying that we are here we are

00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:06,270
forced to be here in a way what is the

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,770
water what about their human needs you

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,780
know like I think that their map would

00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,840
definitely be much different than any

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:17,010
other map of beautiful european city or

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:20,250
going with the child children in Europe

00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:26,880
asking them to do their neighborhood I'm

00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:30,840
asking about that I hope I'm clear so

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,600
usually we got them to map by showing

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,410
them a blank map of the camp from google

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,960
maps and also from open street map and

00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,980
this is clearly highlighted that there

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,210
were not on any map so

00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:51,429
there are needs and demands and weren't

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:53,350
seen anywhere so I think this was made

00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:56,290
really sense to them to map where they

00:23:53,350 --> 00:24:00,040
were of course I know it's a political

00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:02,110
issue and I have a very yeah I have my

00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,840
opinion about what's going on there and

00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:07,960
what might be improved but it wasn't a

00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:11,410
political project so it was really

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,990
mainly to support the refugees to find

00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:17,950
their ways in the camp for the- to know

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:20,320
where the safe spaces are and for new

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,480
arrivals where to go where to get legal

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,230
counseling so i really narrowed this

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,690
down to very practical things and yeah

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,150
that was basically it because people are

00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:34,870
displaced which also means they suffer

00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:39,250
from PTSD and the displacement really

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:43,179
means you have really big difficulties

00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:47,580
in adjusting to situation and more than

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:47,580
we usually do when we visit a new city

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,580
adding to that and then there's a we

00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:56,799
also don't see the map as just a map and

00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,290
we can do with it it's a vehicle of

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,440
engaging with communities engaging with

00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:04,270
people there to try and understand what

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,960
is important for you what do we need to

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:11,260
do how can we help and giving people

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,530
control over that process so if they can

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,840
map like for instance if it's about

00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:19,690
security if they feel not secure in

00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,570
several places we can map or a day or a

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,220
day or they can map a lamp post or maybe

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,559
cameras and that kind of thing and then

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,559
say this is plays where we don't have

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:32,679
these things that and that's why we feel

00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:35,320
unsafe that so it's a vehicle to start

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:38,650
to start a conversation how we can do

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,520
better and therefore is for us very

00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:45,220
important to have the community itself

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,290
take control over that map and that

00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,320
we're not going to say you can map this

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:53,100
and you can't map that I hope that kind

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,100
of answers your question

00:25:53,550 --> 00:26:00,220
it's also really important for reporting

00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,290
and because people get aware of what's

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,810
missing like waste management and such

00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:07,330
things with it which is extremely

00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:12,100
important for the organizations working

00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:18,430
there and we just also just had fun

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:20,020
making to be honest yeah just yeah

00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:21,910
thanks so much in the name of our

00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,670
governments thank you for your help and

00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:27,160
contribution in these scenarios just a

00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,590
quick question about is there a plan to

00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,670
also the open Street View or with map

00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:34,270
you Larry something like that to

00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:37,210
actually get a picture as well for each

00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:40,600
location so we can do all like a little

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:43,810
browsing around these these areas we had

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,850
people from Mapple eatery on site but it

00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:48,760
is very difficult to take pictures in

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,800
the camps and I strongly discourage

00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,900
everybody going there just visiting the

00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,320
camps to even get other smartphones to

00:26:52,900 --> 00:27:00,490
take a picture refugees don't want their

00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:03,610
faces shone so but the people I showed

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:07,420
their over own pictures and we were

00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:09,280
allowed to take them and maybe Larry was

00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,560
on site and they could take pictures are

00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:15,070
not as many as they are were used to but

00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:17,470
I really yeah recommend you to look it

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,180
up there it's very impressive what they

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:28,810
did and they also released the blog post

00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:31,920
and photos draw me okay thank you again

00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,920
