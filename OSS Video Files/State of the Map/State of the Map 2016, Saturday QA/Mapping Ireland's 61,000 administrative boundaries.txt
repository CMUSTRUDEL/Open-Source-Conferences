For the last 6 years, the Irish OSM community has been manually tracing Ireland’s smallest administrative boundaries, townlands, from scanned maps from the 1830s and 1840s. We’ll explain how we’re doing it, what tech we needed, and how you get people to stare at really old maps for hours on end.

We will explore the reasons why this project seemed to catch the imagination of mappers in Ireland and elsewhere. Some of the reasons may be specific to this project - the nature of what was being mapped is in the DNA of many Irish residents! But much is of value more widely, indicating structures and support which maximise engagement and produce accurate and effectively mapping.

hello i'm rory mccann i'm here to talk

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:13,679
to you about a very long mapping project

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,310
we did in ireland and this was supposed

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,380
to be at talk during the two of us and

00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:22,080
myself and dave chorley who has been

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,570
unable to attend Sodom due to work

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,150
commitments unfortunately but I'm sure

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,300
he's looking at the video stream if it's

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:35,130
all working along with i'm sure many

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,800
other people in aren't so one thing i

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,660
didn't mention a when i'm talking with

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,489
ireland here it's a project we did both

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,820
in in Republic of Ireland and Northern

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:56,640
Ireland so it's it's a cross and cross

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:59,129
Ireland all-island thing so h town oh ok

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,710
so what we mapped were called townlands

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,589
and they are the lowest level of Arlen's

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,610
administrative hierarchy as we have the

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,570
country and then we have sort of

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,360
provinces for and then we have counties

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,990
32 in the entire island and then a few

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,810
bits others and then we have tenants so

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,240
they're tiny because earnings not a very

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,439
big country and there's 60,000 of them

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:29,040
or so we mapped them as admin level 10

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:33,420
and so they're they're very small and

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,939
they're very old and there's like

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,920
legends that were written down folk

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,500
tales about a thousand years ago that

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,369
mention some of the town lands that are

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,049
currently existing now I was trying to

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,610
find an image of like oh this is book

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,820
and then this is ours I'm relation

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:55,500
whatever but I can't read old Irish so I

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:58,380
wasn't able to do that yeah so why did

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,880
we map them this is an Open Street Map

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,370
conference why wouldn't you map

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,340
something

00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:07,680
there's other reasons aside from that

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:12,900
addresses is anyone looked at irish

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:15,540
addresses they're horrible we now have

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,030
postcodes and we now have postcodes sort

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,910
of which are also in a very sort of

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,680
stupid clothes way that not help for all

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,420
them but a lot of Irish addresses

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,810
especially in rural areas don't use

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:32,430
street names or street numbers it's kind

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:35,610
of the postman knows where I live that's

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,380
literally the government plan so people

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,630
use these townlands as part of their

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,520
addresses we mapped them in osm we're

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:45,990
able to better address geocoding in

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,670
rural Ireland and another reason to map

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,560
them is they're the lowest level as a

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,050
set of Ireland's administrative

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,710
hierarchy so means other admin

00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,910
boundaries are made up of them and both

00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,830
like legally so it'll be like the

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:04,200
constituency of whatever is based on

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:06,270
townlands detector tatata and now we can

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,580
map constituency boundaries and things

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,850
like that and electoral divisions are

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,190
used by the European statistics agency

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:17,100
there and so we can now use that data a

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,660
lot of Irish government sort of open

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,310
data that they'll open things but they

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,080
won't open the geographic data so

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,320
they'll open you know census results

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,830
keyed off Edie's but you need to know

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,380
where the Edie's are and they're also

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,780
quite useful for historical and heritage

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,580
reasons they're very old they're not

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,440
real they're used in addresses but

00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,050
they're not really used in terms of like

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,400
census results or anything like that now

00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:47,880
but they used to be so you can get a lot

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,090
of census results from Ireland from like

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,930
the late 19th century once countries

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,040
started actually doing censuses and

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,320
they'd be sorted based on either

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,410
townland or civil parish or things like

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,019
that and so there's a large Irish

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,970
diaspora people in America UK everywhere

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,050
really who are descended from marsh

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,269
people and they want to find out more

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,349
about the history and now

00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:15,530
for an example there as I said they're

00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:18,650
very old and part of the history date

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,389
service a description of the place there

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,739
was one called pass if you can which

00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,840
used to be used for highway robberies

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:26,449
it's like well you can go through here

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,669
if you can push I wouldn't with dodgy

00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:32,870
and so that's why so what can we do

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,610
there isn't really any open data we can

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,160
use at least it wasn't at the start

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,810
there isn't really any now while there

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,610
is now because we've mapped it but there

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:47,150
wasn't anything from the government's so

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,919
what did we do so they're not marked

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,900
obviously there's no like signposts

00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,460
really but it's you can see hedges and

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,460
things like that so we need to trace

00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:59,720
most Maps now don't show them that

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,070
they're very tiny so you can't show like

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,000
you couldn't have like an a4 map of

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:07,250
Ireland see them because it'd be just

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,300
too small so don't show them now but

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,830
they used to and there was used for tax

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:19,430
19th century British tax records were

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:23,800
useful they're good for something so in

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:26,000
the mid well early to mid 19th century

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,070
the Ordnance Survey so ardent was part

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,110
of the UK then and the Ordnance Survey

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,389
in the UK mapped Ireland for tax

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,240
purposes and to do social welfare things

00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:37,400
and calculating rates and they made some

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,050
quick maps six inch to the mile one to

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,080
ten thousand maps of the entire country

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:45,320
over period obviously of decades because

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,470
it was the 19th century they shall tag

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:52,970
on borders and obviously CalFresh is

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:54,470
expired on these maps and oh yeah so was

00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:58,729
a long time ago you might think they're

00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:00,349
not very useful but you know the

00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,919
population has actually gone down since

00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:05,300
then because there's a famine and yeah

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,760
our little probably really really well

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,320
mapped compared to most other countries

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:13,900
so this is what the maps look like the

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,830
red is the is the town on border and

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,950
this is zoomed in bed it's got this

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,340
lovely sort of nineteenth-century

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,550
cartography

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:26,030
going on with its kind of washed out

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:28,160
yeah peachy color thing and yeah it's

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,949
lovely looking maps it's great if we can

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,430
copy them and you might notice the

00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:36,320
watermark so one problem with the maps

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,710
is there lots of them obviously one to

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,630
ten thousand and so there's about 2,000

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:45,680
pieces of paper that are about you know

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:48,169
yay big massive because it was 1843 they

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,940
didn't have a four so there isn't a lot

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,610
of places that physically have these

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,380
maps and if they do it's like hey you

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,810
know those maps from 150 years ago I

00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:00,169
just just take them bring them home and

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,090
do things and they don't like that the

00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,620
Ordnance Survey of Ireland has some

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,169
obviously inherited them they scanned

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,450
them in they've cropped them they've

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:14,930
rectified them and they're on the web

00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:19,130
whoo but there can't copyright so we

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:21,560
can't do that we need another source did

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,750
we history here and this first edition

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,450
was made they made a second in some

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,490
point 1910s they made at the third

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,830
edition at one to ten thousand six

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,110
inches and miles and Ireland gets

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,330
independence in 1922 World War two

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,070
starts the UK government is like hey

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,280
there's that country over there that you

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,560
know is on our side what if they get in

00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,870
dated we need to you know know what's

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,389
going on there say reproject to them and

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,479
made some new maps so they took the maps

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:53,990
from 1910 and reproject them down for 21

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,570
and that's what they used so they had

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,310
that his paper and then some libraries

00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:03,260
have those maps which they have scanned

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,940
in and stuff and they said 'we use if

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,880
you crop them rectify them and things

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:10,039
like that will let you scan from them

00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,080
which is cool everyone wins and you know

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:15,650
they're like yeah you can make awesome

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:20,150
time man's knowledge so we used map or /

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:22,220
2 to scan them in lots of mapping i saw

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,800
on twitter i think tim was asking about

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,260
disk space it we've probably used a lot

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,880
of that disk space so you know so

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,500
basically we scan they were all scanned

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,270
in and buy by the university and

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,659
we started cropping them and rectifying

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:39,659
them we can map from them so this is the

00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:45,360
6-inch map this is what we have to deal

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:48,270
with its monochrome so you can see here

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,720
the red is the town on borders can you

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:54,360
spot the townland borders here they're

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,180
actually there you kind of develop a

00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:02,190
sense for these things you know and I

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,420
strain um so that's what we had well

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,420
it's all we had to work with really so

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:10,710
we worked with it and we started mapping

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:15,030
and we kept napping some things make

00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:17,130
this easier yeah johnson city map

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:20,070
tenants so Johnson we did basically all

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:23,580
our mapping in jazan um because you had

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:28,830
custom imagery from map or per layer

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:31,620
thing we had a preset for and like the

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,470
tags and then we had a map stars you

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,110
could see the map and see where it was

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:40,710
multi polygons all over the place so

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:43,560
validator is good there and used someone

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:46,070
set up and max talkin to map data which

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,960
showed the it was a self-replicating

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,150
self-replicating it was it was a tougher

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,010
that updated every minute or whatever I

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,140
would show us where the talents are

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,250
being mapped of where they were so you

00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,570
could see if they're being mapped you

00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,600
know it isn't showing up you've broken

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,300
your polygon yeah the other I set up

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,720
tannins day which just takes the old Sam

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,180
data and just displays it as like an

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,970
interactive sort of web database thing

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,920
which is useful for people to know about

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:18,839
turn ons but then it also has things

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,490
like like like progress report so

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,410
basically counted how much of each

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,870
county was done and how long you know at

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,390
this rate we'll be finished in sometimes

00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,610
it was actually ran into problems that

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:32,400
pythons date library won't let you get

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,830
dates beyond the year 10,000 so it was

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,010
taking a while for a while so slow and

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:41,190
Dave my co-host who is here in spirit

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,209
made some great videos explaining video

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,579
series exactly what to do

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,990
just that walk through all the steps

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,819
about what was happening and how you

00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,410
could map and how you could contribution

00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:53,740
uploading the sheets rectifying the

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:57,309
mapping era era era this was great

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,480
because and you did that publish it out

00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:59,470
and then a few people oh that's

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,470
interesting i'm going to start mapping

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:05,649
now that I know how to do and I can see

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:10,889
what to do and so a lot of people

00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:13,389
committed work for that and yes so

00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:14,860
that's how we're mapping once you have

00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:17,709
the data we can build other

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,040
administrative boundaries we can map all

00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:23,230
the things and some of the other

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,290
high-level ones both historic and non

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,990
historic civil parishes were from the

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,059
Church of Ireland Church of England put

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,779
in Ireland and no longer the state

00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:37,509
religion as of 1871 not really used for

00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:39,040
tack for modern purposes now well

00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:40,300
naturally the church weren't I'm not

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,220
sure maybe it's changed anyway civil

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,459
parishes use a lot for genealogy

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,339
purposes and records so again you can

00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:50,019
search based on that berenis counties

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:53,679
were specially berenis not really used

00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:55,240
but hey barons electoral divisions are

00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,490
one of the big ones their admin knowing

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,319
and they are as I said used for

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,670
constituency's use for census results

00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:05,889
and things like that and and statistics

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,929
both other national and European level

00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:12,730
so now that we have that we can now make

00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:15,129
an open data version of of this data set

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:20,920
that people can then use you don't have

00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:23,199
to go to an OSI so and we started many

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,579
years ago and there are lots of them

00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:29,949
there's about 60,000 the the the

00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:33,279
earliest currently existing townland was

00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:36,869
from jun 2010 I think tremors might have

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:41,170
added one earlier but yeah so six years

00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:44,589
this is who mapped them the area is how

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,959
much each person has mapped it's a bit

00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:49,569
on equal so we have like fifty percent

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,649
row from top three mappers as I said

00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:53,550
some people really came out of the

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,000
woodwork and really just started mapping

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,920
and here is where people mapped so and

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,779
it's colored based on where map you can

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,300
see it's people basically picked the

00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:06,089
area they knew mapped it and just went

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,769
out so you can see people had their

00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,779
areas where they started and where they

00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:12,029
worked because they wanted to maintain I

00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:16,290
want to get you know go away it should

00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:18,450
be really good so I'm going to match yes

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,839
local local mapping spread out and so

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,940
forth who's mapping and mostly men so

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,370
not so great not diversity aspect good

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,350
age age bracket though and you know when

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,170
people in their 70s are using tells them

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,220
to map talents that's pretty cool and

00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:34,050
again because these things have been

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,850
around so long that they are used by

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,000
their been right so long so they're like

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,320
just from historical and heritage aspect

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,700
and some people went to like historical

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,990
society and said hey this this thing

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,579
these are these timelines this is

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,970
openstreetmap this is something that you

00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,980
might consider in and I don't know if

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,570
you can see that this is this is the

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:57,839
rate of mapping it's from that awesome

00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:59,940
style tag stop thing so this is 2014 you

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,360
can really see things took off I think

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,100
it's not here Dave did his videos and

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,620
and you can see just a large constant

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:11,880
rate of mapping up to right here for it

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:15,120
just because we've done this is a this

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,820
is the map stop tellin open gym after i

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,990
eat and it's all about had many years of

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,730
seeing not much gray on this map and

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,470
okay we've mapped them with relations

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,959
and there's no hoodlum oodles of tiny

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,730
tiny relations all over ireland if

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:34,380
you're in ireland and mapping watch the

00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:36,870
relations so it takes a long time but

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,910
you can do it in twenty ten or so it

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,329
looked impossible you got to have the

00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:44,760
tools out there a lot of it's made by i

00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:46,440
said small number of people but you need

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,480
to basically cast a wide net to find

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,860
those people you know if you can get ten

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,149
new people interested and one of them

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,209
turns out to be someone who maps a lot

00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:57,240
you know you've you've you've got your

00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:59,399
your mapping so you need to make it

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,050
accessible to everybody some of the

00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,000
thanks to up see some of the libraries

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:07,450
that helped us with scans and wit maps

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,090
and in trinity college and oxford who

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,770
provided some missing bits of train she

00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,560
didn't have my poor poor for the

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:16,750
rectification and then an blueprint who

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,480
helped us can dance in the physical maps

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,640
we did actually have thanks to the

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,640
governments of Hunter Northern Ireland

00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,280
to decided hey open data is nice let's

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,840
release townland data either sort of

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,500
than or open eyes since somewhat

00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,730
generalized in one in some cases they

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,980
mapped them just before they really

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:39,160
stick just before we finished which was

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,420
great wasn't that nice I think I think

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,550
Northern Ireland government released it

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,820
literally within a week of it being

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,530
finished in Ireland in Northern Ireland

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,870
and so what are we going to do next we

00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:52,630
are going to and we now have something

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,280
we can use for open data purposes we can

00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,960
improve and have improved other

00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,080
boundaries we're going to donate the

00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,770
images back to the libraries and we're

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:06,790
going we're now trying to match up and

00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:09,130
official Irish name Irish names of you

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:12,460
know from the earth language of places

00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:17,200
and much that it to osm and that's the

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:20,490
end oh dear God those are apps I am yes

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:24,640
and I have one image you can see which

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:30,010
mmm Cullen did this literally yesterday

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:31,240
as a gif mmm ok let's start again so

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,089
this this I don't know if you can read

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:38,350
them two dates but so 2011 this is each

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:41,740
town and being mapped 2012-2013 it took

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:51,810
a long time 2014 hey stuff starts

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:51,810
kicking off yes so any questions

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:17,310
no questions I just have to ask this are

00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:20,790
they all marked with Rick evading ids I

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:23,590
don't know and one interesting point is

00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,320
Wikipedia article on townlands was

00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:29,200
updated by someone I don't know who and

00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,850
with the size of of the largest talent

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,980
and the previous source was a book from

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:36,550
1860s and the new source is

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:39,460
openstreetmap so it is used and I don't

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,600
know thermic dinner it's even download

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:49,900
the data if you can import it you could

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:51,880
import it so is it the case that the

00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,100
boundaries of the townlands haven't

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,540
actually changed in those 200 years

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,980
whatever usually not know there's some

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,620
cases where a lake would have drived up

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:06,160
or something like that or a coastal

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:11,440
reclamation and basically not know I

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:13,360
mean there's no so they change the

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,900
larger entities by changing which

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,860
townlands are included rather than by

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,260
actually changing the boundaries of the

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,880
townlands at all yeah exactly or like

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,830
within within a city they might go it

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,820
goes in on this road until this corner

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,400
and then turns left or something like

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,540
that the townlands I think did change a

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,280
bit between the first and the third

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,060
edition so but they were only in the

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:42,730
last 100 years but no no otherwise there

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:45,100
for about a thousand years or so people

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:48,510
probably how it will be bad luck first

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,040
firstly absolutely outstanding project

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,690
we were once involved in looking at the

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,510
rest is in Ireland and we knew what an

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,760
incredible mess it was and I code is

00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,740
doing not much more than adding to that

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,260
mess you created something that is

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,169
genuinely useful so congratulations i

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,269
think that is fantastic

00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:07,980
I was going to ask the same question as

00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:11,399
the previous speaker which is do they

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,100
really really not change so what happens

00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:16,080
if you have developments that put

00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,269
buildings across town land boundaries do

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,519
tend are the buildings that traverse a

00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,529
town that boundaries or results legally

00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,119
impossible oh no there's no legal reason

00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:28,320
that it would be banned and yes that

00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:30,600
does happen so obviously in like Dublin

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,909
sprawl or in the cities of sprawled and

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:37,080
you can what used to be fields were not

00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:40,049
anymore so in that case we basically

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,090
just mapped what was there before and

00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:43,679
they're not used I mean they're things

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,980
love but they're they're not really used

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,539
in the kind of like you can't map we

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,710
can't build across them because I mean

00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:54,299
some of them would be the size of this

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:58,230
room for example you know it a lot of

00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:59,519
the time we used like hedges in farms a

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,009
minute it's similar to England in the

00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,409
sensitive loads a little fields all over

00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:06,600
the place and they be made up of that so

00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:08,129
yeah in like ninety-nine percent of

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,619
times they haven't changed if you look

00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:16,440
there's an airport in Ireland in the

00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:18,299
West Coast about hair and dash obviously

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,489
farms and they just built the airport so

00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:22,080
I mapped all the towns in exactly and it

00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:28,850
goes across runways and stuff and it's

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:31,440
quite funny do you have any idea if

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:34,559
mapping all the tournament's was a

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:40,289
factor in getting it released as open

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:42,330
data if oh and if having all the open

00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,460
street map map is map that kind of stuff

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:47,580
was also instrumental in opening more

00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,529
than just the town lines well so I

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,649
didn't hear the second paragraph if it

00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:56,730
helped change the minds oh we have

00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:58,350
opened this stuff I don't know the Irish

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,679
government had been playing around with

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,239
open data for a while so it's not like

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,129
it wasn't out of the blue it was like oh

00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:08,759
we released another thing and it sort of

00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:11,130
is this but I don't know if was if it

00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:15,330
was used by that I

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:18,660
oh yeah it probably existed beforehand I

00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:21,300
mean like the you know releasing it like

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,600
a week after we finished government's

00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:38,370
don't move that fast not Irish

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:44,820
governments lunchtime so any remaining

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:47,400
question no sure okay well then I think

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,960
we can tank again or speakers for the

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,960
