Title: Watching for vandalism
Publication date: 2016-10-17
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Saturday QA
Description: 
	Sajjad Anwar at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/watching-for-vandalism/
(No audio during the talk due to technical problems, questions start at 15 minutes)

OpenStreetMap today is much more than a street map. The data is used for navigation, data visualisation, art, urban planning and much more. Today, there were over 20k changesets - making OSM one of the most active open data projects with great adoption. Accidental edits and attempts at vandalism make a bigger impact than they used to. Mapbox are learning about these problems and approaching them holistically - fixing issues every day, using existing tools, improving editing software, and building new tools and workflows for emerging problems.

Sajjad will share what they have learned so far. He will discuss technical details and challenges behind the tools and workflows they are building, how they gather feedback, ideas and insights from the community, and talk about first response systems to maintain OSM as the best map of the world.

without further delay I introduced it to

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:07,170
our first speaker who will talk to us

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,859
about preventing vandalism and applause

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,859
for our speaker please

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:44,380
what does it look like for all of us to

00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:58,000
work and build more tools around the

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:59,220
stuff let's take care of the map thank

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,930
you for very interesting and

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:13,720
motivational presentations any questions

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:15,520
for the speaker from the audience hi how

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,149
big is the team right now and how many

00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,550
people will it be in five years on and

00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:24,850
off I think every day about five to six

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:32,200
people look at about 50 to 60 chainsets

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:35,980
every day first question is just what

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:39,370
was the website for a real time for real

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:44,020
time this map the first man in question

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:47,410
is there a list of those suspicious

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:51,640
words is there is a list you can point

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:54,670
me to yeah so often if you go to Oh some

00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,690
charred mattebox calm you can see the

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,529
list of suspicious chainsets and the

00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:03,100
visualization of the live change it's

00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:05,050
called map are calm / map beat we

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,670
haven't tested it really for loads I

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,179
don't know if it'll break but if it does

00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,179
let me know

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:42,870
Lou when you use QA tools I'll just stop

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:44,600
making fixes that makes the QA problem

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:50,640
go away better aren't a cheater right

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:52,860
snapping sorry let me try let me see if

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,990
I understand that right I use so the

00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,530
question is when we make fixes in

00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:11,520
OpenStreetMap how do we make sure the

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:13,620
problem go away ah sir that's it just to

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,280
make sure the bad mapping goes the way

00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:22,290
and not just stops report being reported

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:26,010
by the QA tools oh okay is it kind of it

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,870
the engagement with all right um yeah so

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,840
there are only very few cases we

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,540
actually revert the chain sets most

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,669
often we make a chance at comment that

00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,130
talks about okay hey welcome to

00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:40,860
openstreetmap this is why this may not

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,960
be a good idea to do it this way and

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,929
here are some recommendations and guides

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,510
that you can follow and we recently

00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:51,059
wrote a very post about what what is the

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,640
amount of time that we wait to get

00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,350
response from a user to go in and fix

00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,600
that ourselves and there are a lot of

00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,610
discussions are on that we don't think

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,169
we have answer yet but we don't

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,330
immediately go in and drove out any

00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:09,660
chain sir try to engage in that

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:11,820
conversation and do you think things are

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,590
fair that so this is matt box doing it

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,440
is a company do you think there's a fair

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,540
and how do you resolve this the matte

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,780
box and other companies on I'm not

00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:24,240
saying it's just my books but people

00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:26,700
companies will starting the QA and then

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,820
the individuals will think they don't

00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,610
need to do any personal QA I think how

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,169
can we help that I've over the course of

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,539
the last day I've been at hots on that

00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:37,940
as well as the

00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,559
that stated the map and this week have

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,960
had many conversations with people about

00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:44,330
what they think about validating the map

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,369
and many people are doing this I don't

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,070
know Ethan from the DWG made a lightning

00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:50,779
talk yesterday about how he is

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:54,169
envisioning some of the tools I know

00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:56,539
TeleNav is invested in improve osm and

00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:58,429
that sort of work DWG is certainly

00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:01,129
thinking about the ways that they can

00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:04,309
collaborate better so I don't think it's

00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:07,759
a it's the effort by a single small

00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:09,259
group of people versus an individual we

00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:13,879
make the map we might as well take care

00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:15,739
of it right Thanks your talk is going to

00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,599
see these tools being developed Martin

00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:19,279
from cycle streets and one of the things

00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,259
that I see a lot is is not so much

00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,139
deliberate vandalism but that users who

00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:25,639
don't understand routability concepts

00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,409
particularly things like we see a lot of

00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:29,389
cycleways along side roads that don't

00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:31,009
properly Kang side roads and they're all

00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:32,899
see things that automated tools such as

00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:35,330
keep right which we we use a lot on

00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:38,570
which is fantastic and can pick up my

00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:40,879
question really is what movement is the

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,559
and maybe this is not so much view

00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:44,809
exactly but for the rest of community

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,460
and to get some of these tools embedded

00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,409
properly an ID because I think things

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,639
like you know fixing connectivity

00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:51,379
problems they're the kinds of things

00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:53,239
that was more visibility directly in the

00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:56,299
editors we get fixed up a lot a lot

00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:57,979
quicker right so Johnson has a validator

00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:00,529
that's within Johnson which does a

00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:02,269
pretty good job of kind of notifying but

00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:04,460
well we found out that a lot of people

00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:07,759
didn't know that existed in Joseph right

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:10,190
so we we try to let communicate that as

00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,799
much this is a conversation that I'm

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,950
interested in having in the fix that we

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,190
made an ID is very simple and that sort

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,259
of interface and changes make a lot of

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,509
things much easier and come to the bar

00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:30,009
fandom I'm interested in the ways that

00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:30,009
we can collaborate any more questions

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,410
so this is a little bit of a tangent but

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,600
I'm curious how you guys deal with

00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,800
disputes like border disputes and things

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,780
like that particularly things that are

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,940
more kind of as a community level rather

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,590
than big international processes how do

00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:00,840
how do you how do you approach that I

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:03,690
don't think we do that as a team when we

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,370
see stuff like that we involve the DWG

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:09,210
and that's kind of the function that the

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:11,580
WG exists for and firm the conversations

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,990
that I've had with folks on the DWG it

00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,120
sounds to me that they trying to

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,190
actually deal with people problems and

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,870
not data problems right so when

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,270
someone's trying to say okay I know this

00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,370
is right versus someone else's like go

00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,590
away what are you saying right so sort

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:28,710
of like managing that expectation

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:31,260
between between mappers within the seiko

00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:33,870
system but there are and so many of

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,360
those happening which is which brings me

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,820
to the point that like I would really

00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,200
love to see DWG right and talk about a

00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,470
lot of these things that they come

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,600
across as well we write weekly the poets

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,760
and I know that there's a certain amount

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,050
of time commitment that goes into this

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,050
but we're happy to help

00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:07,499
hello my name is Michael I actually I've

00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:10,469
happened to have been in countries where

00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:22,139
you have border disputes and I did not

00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:24,179
really answer could you just take what I

00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,889
was saying is just expand on this too

00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:28,529
right so we can because I mean it's real

00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:31,619
and you have many problems local

00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:34,469
problems between you know two sides of

00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:37,589
the border pianist an in the Balkans I

00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:39,269
mean in so many places and so you know

00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:41,489
what is the standard that you use to

00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:46,559
follow up on this question what is the

00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:49,649
standard you use to fix this sorry so I

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,929
think that's more of a decision that DWG

00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:54,629
makes in terms of how they want to

00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:57,419
manage the dispute between two

00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:59,639
individuals in the community my answer

00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:02,820
was that we don't if we notice that

00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:05,609
happen our response would be to send a

00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,649
report to DWG making them aware of that

00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:10,259
this is happening and that's more of our

00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:13,909
role and not get involved in trying to

00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:16,979
fix that issue between those individuals

00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:19,080
DWG is the OpenStreetMap data working

00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:21,179
group they're part of the foundation and

00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,399
do pretty amazing job and making sure

00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:28,619
conflicts don't happen in OpenStreetMap

00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:35,249
we have time for one last question if

00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:36,839
there is any if there are none then

00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:39,409
let's thank our speaker again for the

00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:39,409
