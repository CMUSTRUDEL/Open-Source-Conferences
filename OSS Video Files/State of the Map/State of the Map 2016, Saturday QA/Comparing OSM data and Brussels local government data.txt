In 2013, the buildings from the Brussels local government database were incorporated into OSM. Although the local government databases are updated every three months, there is still no process to integrate theses changes into OSM. Having such a process would be beneficial for OSM but also for local government.

Marc will describe a process to compare two databases. Currently, the method uses the Hausdorff distance to detect the differences on the building shapes. He is currently working on the automation of this method and exploring tools like Osmose that help mappers keep the datasets up to date.
