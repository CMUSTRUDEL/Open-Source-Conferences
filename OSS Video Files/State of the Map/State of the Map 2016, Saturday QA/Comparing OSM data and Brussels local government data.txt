http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/comparing-osm-data-and-brussels-local-government-data-urbis-in-order-to-improve-both-databases/

In 2013, the buildings from the Brussels local government database were incorporated into OSM. Although the local government databases are updated every three months, there is still no process to integrate theses changes into OSM. Having such a process would be beneficial for OSM but also for local government.

Marc will describe a process to compare two databases. Currently, the method uses the Hausdorff distance to detect the differences on the building shapes. He is currently working on the automation of this method and exploring tools like Osmose that help mappers keep the datasets up to date.

thanks to be here so i will talk about

00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:15,599
comparing recent data and with the local

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:20,220
data from the government your bees so

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:23,910
i'm working in a jean evil and we work

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:31,800
with voice and data sometimes and we

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:39,000
really enjoy so there is a work and also

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:43,489
i'm in reggio so in fact osm is about

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,550
open data and reggio is open tools and

00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:53,719
it's very complimentary so don't

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,719
hesitate to explore the tools of reggio

00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,829
so the data that we will explore is your

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,470
bees it's created by the government of

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,020
bruising so in belgium you have a tree

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:12,170
region and one of the region is a

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:19,020
bruiser and they have done own data they

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:26,700
have open listens that you can find the

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:29,250
+ in 2013 they opened the data and the

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,880
local community import all the data in

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:36,840
the US m and the measure work was done

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:42,570
by Bruce Merrill will create the USM

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:51,090
files to be imported the instruction

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:56,070
West West to put the ref urbis and the

00:01:51,090 --> 00:02:06,450
ideal of the the buildings and there is

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:08,140
some statistics then may 2005 at 2015 so

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,740
most of the

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:14,470
the work has been done and sometimes the

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:18,940
buildings are present in the universe on

00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:24,990
but the tags where some ref yo bees is

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:32,040
not present so the comparison is done

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:34,600
comparing tags ref or bees but it's not

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,390
sometimes it doesn't work because if we

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,530
if you add some new buildings you don't

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:44,130
know the witch tiger to add two to make

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,680
the link with the herb is that a basil

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:52,019
I'm also sometimes the when there is

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:56,370
missing tags the 30 secure doesn't work

00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:59,019
and also other ide of the buildings

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:04,180
matched change sometimes the buildings

00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:09,190
are arise and recreate and so it's not

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:13,390
otherwise variable but the in obese they

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:16,989
create a new ID which is inspired idea

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:21,190
and normally it won't change from

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:27,820
version to version so the the idea will

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:31,799
be always the same and so to compare

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:37,170
obese obese the database Abby's and osm

00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:40,060
who idea was to comparing with geometry

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:45,700
operation so it was to compare the the

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:49,620
polygons together the advantage is we

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:53,260
don't need to have the refuse your bees

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,739
if it's me senior we can continue to

00:03:53,260 --> 00:04:01,329
compare the the to make the comparison

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:05,170
and also we can detect difference

00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:09,790
between the two geometries and so detect

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:13,359
well where we have to whether it's a new

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:15,840
challenge and and stuff like that so the

00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:21,790
Demeter is

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:24,430
you can download the obese data and it's

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:28,990
a shapefile there is a lot of format but

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,490
you can have it in shape file under

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,360
there is some tools shall I to

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:38,320
postgresql to import the data in Pass

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:41,970
Christian oh and for the Western data

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,310
you can also put the data in passages

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:49,870
with the to the osmosis and then it's

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:54,270
possible to to put to do some special

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,270
requests interject intersection before

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:06,450
so it's not so easy in fact to from sm

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:12,520
data to create the purchase polygons

00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:16,720
there is a lot of case the easiest is we

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:21,430
have a way with the building tags begins

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:25,030
yes Orson which is not know the results

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,830
or some moderation it's all most of the

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:32,320
time it's when the reason all in the

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:38,020
Virginia and the relation has the tiger

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:40,620
building yes another tag which is not

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:45,370
know and sometimes the addition has no

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:50,050
tag buildings but she contains a polygon

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:53,380
which which has the building tags okay

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:59,400
and sometimes there is a possibility to

00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:02,800
have I'll onda it's more when you map a

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:07,270
leg leg with a nylon de and it's

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:11,430
possible to save first we have a pretty

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:14,200
girl Excel polygon then we have all and

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:17,420
then we'll have another polygon inside

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,570
the inside the

00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:24,410
so it's a building with another building

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:27,890
inside and free there is only one in

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:31,130
Brussels and the abyss consider these

00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:35,150
two polygons this paragon has two

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:41,740
polygons and so we didn't manage this

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:45,700
case for the camper version another

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:51,910
problem also is we possessed need some

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:59,570
valid geometry so it's not crossing some

00:06:51,910 --> 00:07:02,270
it's 212 put polygons well done and so

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:06,740
we have to eliminate the result lot of

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:13,280
polygons which are not valid this also

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:17,120
has this kind of polygons so now we have

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,980
the polygons in the database and the

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,320
question is I would compare the data and

00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,420
we want to to have the possibility to

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:31,240
have a little shift between the polygons

00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:33,710
so maybe with the with the view

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,520
sometimes that there is a little gap

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:41,710
between the the polygons in orbison osm

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:47,390
and I we manage I we deal with this

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:52,250
problem is to make from the osm polygon

00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:59,540
to make a buffer a negative buffer which

00:07:52,250 --> 00:08:01,900
is the green polygonal this one so the

00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:07,460
polygon wearisome is the black one and

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:09,500
we reduce it in the green particular in

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:14,540
the green polygon and then the question

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:18,080
is is the green / gone inside the red

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:23,069
Wagner and so if you have this

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:29,729
if we have this desire a shin we know

00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:34,620
that the polygons from usm is is also in

00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:42,839
our business we can do the battle yeah

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:45,300
you can so the herbs polygons are the

00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:48,180
red one the awesome polygons are the

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:53,820
blue one and the buffer is to the green

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:56,850
one and the question was in position to

00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:00,540
ask if every green were pretty gone was

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:06,810
in a red van to detect if there is some

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:11,580
missing polygons in your bees in sm that

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:15,899
there is some buildings which are in sm

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:21,209
but not in your bees and the question is

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:24,480
is where is the the problem is is it in

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:29,820
sm 0 in lobbies we don't know we we have

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:37,500
to to go there and to correct so maybe

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:40,110
its buildings that were remove that

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:47,060
there is also somebody guns in your bids

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:53,399
but not in osm yeah you can it's yeah

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:57,420
yeah the reserves or buildings and from

00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:02,010
your bees which stands and buildings and

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:06,740
multiple buildings innovation so the the

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:14,339
yellow building is over two buildings in

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:18,440
innovation and also so we don't we try

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:21,480
to go further and also to detect the

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,510
difference between the shapes and in

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,800
passages that there is a you can compute

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:31,430
the distance between 22 /

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,580
guns it's a user with the stuff distance

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:39,110
so if the distance is zero it means that

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:41,750
two polygons are at the same and when

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:45,829
the distance is a bigger than bigger it

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:51,620
it means that the the polygons are the

00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:59,540
found them and there is some example of

00:10:51,620 --> 00:11:03,470
different shapes so these buildings and

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:09,649
on the Left it's from osm and the right

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:16,190
it's from Abby's yeah also there is some

00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:23,140
difference okay and now the statistics

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:29,029
so in Brussels we managed to to have

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:35,980
this amount of some buildings in the

00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:40,579
obese database we have 200,000 modern to

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:44,060
200,000 buildings we didn't compute the

00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:49,089
invalid buildings from Alison because we

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:52,820
remove it you know SQL universe ql

00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:58,690
request so we didn't compute it but I

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,690
assume it's quite a lot that there is a

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,380
212 invalid you're visible buildings

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:11,290
buildings in sm but not in your biz it's

00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:20,290
12,000 you have been building in your

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:25,410
biz but not in osm it's 17,000 modern

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:29,250
17,000 and different of

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:34,410
and buildings intersect e tinh multiple

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:38,819
ways and buildings it's a 1000 so that

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:41,550
there is a lot of work to there is a lot

00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:48,060
of indication and then to correct to

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:54,930
check if we have to correct osm soon the

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:59,819
next step will be to integrate the work

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:02,850
in Ozma's on and we talked with some

00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:05,910
people and the idea will be to use a

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:13,339
smooth and to add it in the subcategory

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:16,980
of buildings so yes all this work you

00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:22,500
put all the requests in a docker

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:25,980
container so you can download it and you

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,100
have just two to recreate the database

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:33,540
on which is a purchase database you have

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:36,630
to inoue right three lines just to

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:41,699
denote the card to create the containers

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:44,639
and then to create the render come to

00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:52,649
the containers and are the cards that

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:55,819
you can find yeah so some conclusion it

00:13:52,649 --> 00:14:00,779
was very interesting because I think

00:13:55,819 --> 00:14:06,810
comparing this to different database you

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:10,850
can improve both of the database so that

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:18,750
there is a lot of buildings to check and

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:23,550
if we manage to have a processes yo

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:28,410
continuous processes we can we can have

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:31,560
improve the sm database and also all

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:36,120
this work was done with cuties on

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:40,590
purchase and it's very easy to work with

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:44,279
these two tools because the perfect

00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:50,160
couple and and you can see the very

00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:53,330
easily the result of the of the queries

00:14:50,160 --> 00:15:04,529
in the you cuties so it was a very

00:14:53,330 --> 00:15:16,770
interesting don't you any questions for

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:20,580
our speaker front row I have just a

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:23,690
quick question about the 2012 00 2 202

00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:28,290
12 buildings that is invalid in hobbies

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:29,760
did you did you send to the obese guys

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:35,480
like this is some buildings that are

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:39,780
long hey fix it wasn't like this or boom

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:43,890
do to you in that statistic there are

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:48,270
212 buildings that are invalid did you

00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:52,110
notice the op's persons that they have

00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:56,640
this invalid data in the data set I'm

00:15:52,110 --> 00:16:01,020
sorry the ultra so the question is about

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:04,770
the invalid 212 buildings that you have

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:07,589
they do you notice did you send email to

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:10,050
the people from Obie's to do to be aware

00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:15,240
about this invalid building so they can

00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:19,200
fix it all the moment we we just detect

00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,650
that Jesus this weekend and yes we will

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,650
protect them

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:37,130
thank you and did use today some

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:40,710
particular cases to see the evolution of

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:44,000
some polygons of buildings since they

00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:49,320
have been imported in osm from the base

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:54,810
base base like on logged changed logged

00:16:49,320 --> 00:17:03,150
in an osm no we didn't do such a lot so

00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:04,770
but it remove Liam tourism um I think

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,689
this is a really great tool but I have a

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:11,390
question I guess because you're checking

00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:14,880
data validity between urbis and osm and

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:17,579
maybe one of the things to know where

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,650
the validity is coming from did Herb us

00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:23,579
use different imagery to digitize their

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,980
buildings that could be the problem

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,750
right there to check I mean maybe it'd

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,960
be worth just looking at metadata before

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,450
you even begin this process to verify

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,160
the imagery that was used and then you

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,929
might be able to see because this kind

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,640
of goes ties into what the ambassador

00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:40,860
was saying the other day yesterday

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,660
morning that you know he's digitizing

00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,120
one building and then he's got this

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,970
rogue user that's changing it because

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,179
she's comparing it to a different image

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,980
that was two years older or something so

00:17:51,179 --> 00:18:00,420
perhaps it could be new construction or

00:17:52,980 --> 00:18:06,260
you know new road yes I think this as

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:09,920
Missouri from the they'll create photo

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:15,750
photo imagery I know they yeah the

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:17,280
digital guys demo accenture yes I think

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:22,140
it's its center it will be interesting

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:24,650
to give them push it back but yes we

00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,650
will contact them

00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:36,169
hello to questions you said you had

00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:39,439
sometimes multiple osm buildings for one

00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:43,129
urbis building are you grouping them by

00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:46,609
ervice ID are ready and my second

00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:49,399
question are the license is compatible

00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:54,139
with each other for their osm improved

00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:56,419
data to be contributed back to base the

00:18:54,139 --> 00:19:02,479
surfer the moment we only detect the

00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:06,439
difference and we didn't proper a child

00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:10,069
we didn't change the person reading so

00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:13,159
but the idea would be to put the

00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:16,669
difference in Ozma's on and then the the

00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:20,319
mapper will will have the choice to

00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:26,179
correct in which whether they be correct

00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:28,129
so but i think if yeah we will have

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:33,019
discussion and the main man in east if

00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:35,899
we if we have a single building in

00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:38,289
lobbies with a single reference do we

00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:41,629
have to regroup the two buildings

00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:45,559
together it should be a question on the

00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:53,319
mailing list and the results are

00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:53,319
compatible service any more questions

00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,440
well this is not the first time that

00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,990
this conclusion that mixing public that

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,080
with awesome that at the final you get

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:10,370
improve it or a database of your special

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:13,340
data and I know that there are some

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:18,710
research lines working on that and that

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:22,610
on using public OSN maybe private data

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:25,280
to have better spatial information I

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:29,510
wonder if you are thinking in continue

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,419
these works as research into University

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:35,929
or private institution in the sense that

00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:39,470
it will be good to to have more research

00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:44,059
in this area and be more public policies

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:49,490
posted about that because I mean is good

00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:52,870
for everyone for the moment we we don't

00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:57,590
think I think we will create a

00:20:52,870 --> 00:21:02,330
continuous process to every six months

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:06,380
yo buceta update and so we will update

00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:10,460
the difference maybe every month every

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:14,059
night so the idea is to have a a

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:18,950
continuous process for the mappers to

00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:22,220
know how it would fix the stuff about

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:27,320
the research we further moment we don't

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:30,200
think about research but if you if you

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,169
want to go to collaborate with us you

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:37,929
can contact us and we will be able to

00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:37,929
try to do some research with that yes

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,740
next question

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:55,919
was there another question is it answer

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:57,090
to meanwhile any more questions okay

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:03,919
then let's give our speaker another

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:03,919
