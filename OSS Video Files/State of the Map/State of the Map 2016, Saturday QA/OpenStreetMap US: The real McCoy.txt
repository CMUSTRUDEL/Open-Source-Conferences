Description: 
	Alyssa Wright, Ian Dees, Martijn van Exel at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/openstreetmap-us-the-real-mccoy/

OpenStreetMap US is one of the most significant OpenStreetMap communities in the world. Organized in 2009, OpenStreetMap US manages the largest budget, conference, website, and mapathons. We have also supported the production of key OpenStreetMap development tools such as MapRoulette and iD Editor, collaborated with federal, state and local government agencies, and assisted with ten major OpenStreetMap humanitarian response. And â€“ we are friendly! From its very beginnings, OpenStreetMap US has been a functional model of communication and action.

In this presentation the entire US board would like to reflect on lessons learned as a contribution to the international OpenStreetMap community. With some of us involved in OpenStreetMap leadership for over ten years, we will summarize what we have learned from local investment and the vision we are moving towards for national impact.

yeah hello hi hi everyone um so as

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:12,710
Martin was just saying um I am Alyssa

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,240
right I'm part of the OpenStreetMap us

00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:19,890
community and have been on the board for

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:23,490
the past two years this is Martin I'm

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,560
more time I have been in the United

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,480
States for five years thanks for having

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:33,840
us oh and please feel free to reach out

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:35,510
to me at let's see Jeter or en edo so

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,300
ian is going to be talking to us later

00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:42,500
and I I was I've been on the open Street

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,660
of us chapter board for a few years

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,969
together with alyssa and all of the

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,430
board as the entire board we submitted a

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,550
talk was initially I think rejected and

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,020
then yes and then and then we got

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,829
accepted after all so that's why it's

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,079
little chaotic perhaps and but now we're

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,270
all set and we can start we're going to

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,400
be each talking for a few minutes about

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,229
various aspects of what's happening in

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,420
the United States not so much with the

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,840
map itself but more with the people that

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,270
make the map and what we do as a board

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,119
to kind of help help people do what they

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:23,119
like to do and alyssa is going to start

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,119
yep

00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:30,390
everyone I had no idea what you said

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,720
that's one of our secret sauce right

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:37,080
there um no so this is called the real

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,100
McCoy um AK the confessional just a

00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,320
little piece I I helped to name this I

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,420
don't really know what it's like what

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,820
the real McCoy means but from urban

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,090
dictionary it's kind of like the real

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,729
deal there's we were kind of inspired by

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,229
and and somebody else said this going to

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,850
talk that we just listened to you know

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,240
they're there can often be in like the

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,590
dynamics of not often but there are I'm

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,360
sure everybody's experience than

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,729
dynamics of the community of sometimes

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,330
very positive and collaborative and

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,510
other times can be quite toxic and so we

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,390
think that there are lessons in both how

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,940
the u.s. community operates and how

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,330
we're part of the leadership that can

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,100
potentially you know be lessons as as we

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,920
go as a larger international community

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,620
and as other local international

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,359
regional communities continue to evolve

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,250
so the real star of all of this is the

00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:38,310
OpenStreetMap us community I mean it's

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,730
been a real pleasure to be part of it

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,829
I'm and to serve it and you know all of

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,459
this is kind of like our own sort of

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:50,190
perspective on the work but I'm one of

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:54,000
the I think the fundamental things that

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,769
we all believe in and we all follow is

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,859
that you know again this is in service

00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:01,950
to what we would say the real star which

00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:04,500
is the community that's me I'm going to

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:08,640
use a dog theme in my five minutes which

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,609
it might be extensive um so um like this

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,410
outfit um we're gonna be talking about

00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:19,799
the board and are and kind of fun stuff

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,010
that we do there and how we do it I'm

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,660
going to explain this dog reference so

00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:27,680
display a digital globe image I don't

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,720
know but I found it on the internet and

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,420
when I was in school which was in New

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,319
York City coming from New York I used to

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,150
go to a dog

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,120
park on a regular basis it was a little

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,980
weird as like a lunch hour break but I

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,819
actually learned a lot I'm hanging out

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:47,639
in the dog park and watching dogs while

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,909
eating my lunch and so when reflecting

00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:54,840
on this talk and what I've learned from

00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:57,030
the community and helping to to helping

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,180
to lead it and support it I think that

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:08,370
there are a lot of lessons from dogs

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:10,799
that are applicable so yeah so um one of

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,629
the things that's been really helpful in

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,579
relevant again in like leadership which

00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:17,849
is a sort of a what I see is a service

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:20,039
role it support role is for all of us to

00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:22,949
be rather curious so nobody comes to

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:25,470
leadership position and I think in my

00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:29,580
conversations within the OpenStreetMap

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,860
community thinking that or with them the

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,940
arrogance like kind of an arrogant sort

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,349
of thing that nobody is like

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,690
particularly right so this sort of

00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,990
humility has kind of really been key I

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:43,669
think for the success of the community

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:45,990
and then this is really important for

00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,460
the work that I'm interested in is that

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,580
there's a certain amount of playfulness

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,419
so there's no sense in the decisions

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,280
that we make at the board level that

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:59,280
again that we're like specifically right

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,800
and anybody's wrong or that this is

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,889
going to be the only like cross road

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,680
that will CC but rather to try things

00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:10,849
out I think we've really adopted it

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,849
likes more of an agile

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,110
well structured you know sort of

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:26,629
development so that's allowed us to try

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:29,000
out a number of things that in in a more

00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:31,789
playful manner so some of the things

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,349
that are coming from the OpenStreetMap

00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:36,800
community that we've helped to support

00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:39,110
and we've helped to evolve are listed

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,469
here I'm there everything from like you

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,360
know real legal status um and taxes and

00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:48,439
money that's you know involved with that

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:52,039
to you no more innovative projects

00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:55,150
around education and you know the osm

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:57,860
census is like a demographics kind of

00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,240
review to something that's like a you

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,680
know the map time if you guys are

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,569
familiar with that I think it's been a

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:09,620
really interesting and international

00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:12,020
kind of movement so we're able to do

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,029
part of that because each of us has a

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,840
job there are five people on the board

00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:19,520
you'll hear from all of them I'm

00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,289
currently the president martin has been

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,620
the president actually he's been every

00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:28,729
position yeah I think he's currently at

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:32,599
large so watch out and and with that

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:34,819
like with that kind of position is both

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,789
like a stated position like ian is

00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,800
treasurer he'll speak to that work but

00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:41,930
and it's clear that that's his

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,139
responsibility but also like we kind of

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,210
adopt I think or speak for different

00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:50,839
communities and personalities on the

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:56,509
board as well and and we rely on each

00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:59,690
other to represent that and again we do

00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:03,620
that in in service so I think again none

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:08,360
of us sees I mean def definitely um it

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,759
is it is and like an honor um I use that

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,860
word meaningfully and not lightly but I

00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,500
you know I recognize might be in the

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,870
Hallmark card but but it really is like

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:22,460
an honor to be able to serve and I think

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:26,150
we all sort of approach our role in with

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,160
with that in mind so some of this

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,960
cesses of the OpenStreetMap us community

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,610
and again what the board has helped to

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,590
like facilitate is we we do do a number

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,480
of different events but we do have like

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,120
the largest openstreetmap conference in

00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:45,170
the world I think we have on the largest

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,390
endowment in the world we have a range

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,970
of different types of affiliations from

00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:53,990
like individual contributors to you know

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:59,540
a national government we are one of the

00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:02,810
most active Twitter Facebook slack IRC

00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,640
mumble I don't know and blog so we have

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,300
a really active communication channels

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,220
we are kind to each other and I'll go

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,180
back to this but I mean we follow twee

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:16,070
we have and we follow a code of conduct

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,620
you're seeing a lot of innovation again

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,020
coming from individual contributors as

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,600
well as the company's I'm sorry and we

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:29,900
pay taxes so anyway part of the way we

00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:31,640
do that we disagree Dave Lee um and we

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,500
all kind of like pick on like a

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,570
different sort of initiatives and

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,550
support each other and that so those

00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:42,320
things again and sort of the lead person

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:44,930
there and then we keep it clean and we

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,020
really like I think follow a shared

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:50,000
mission but also a shared way of doing

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,350
it which is like respectfully with a

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,200
code of conduct and so the results I

00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:00,320
mean you saw the conference of money the

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,290
innovation you know etc but I well I

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,620
think that one of our clear successes is

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:09,020
that I've never been on a remote team

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,770
especially a volunteer team that's like

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:15,800
a hundred percent completely functional

00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:19,240
and that is a huge success on both of

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:24,200
the of the community and the board um

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:28,460
and then this makes me extremely hopeful

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:31,700
for the future of openstreetmap I think

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:36,830
that um you know not only do we have

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:39,590
sort of like kind of real strategy

00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:43,880
um like ingredient I feel like we have

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:48,290
ingredients to help to continue to move

00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,000
like openstreetmap forward and then pass

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:54,710
over to Martin actually or in the other

00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:02,240
three border I was just going to start

00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:06,400
the video right yeah so this is our

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,990
first guest speaker of today which is

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:13,130
does this display I need to I need to

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:18,110
drag it right to someplace else oh yeah

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:21,020
there we go there is meat Ian these are

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:27,460
treasure currently I'm going to rewind

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,460
it to the play it right

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:44,569
where did he go I know I don't

00:10:40,879 --> 00:11:04,610
second-guess speaker than now the whole

00:10:44,569 --> 00:11:09,889
thing froze up now do this move fast and

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:11,389
break things is it working yeah well I

00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:16,429
was just going to expand on some of the

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:19,189
Lissa's thoughts really um so when I use

00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:21,410
when I moved to the west this isn't 2011

00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:24,439
I was in the Netherlands before that

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,069
where I grew up and I helped start the

00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:31,059
OpenStreetMap community there in

00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:33,439
2006-2007 and at the time I moved

00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:37,910
openstreetmap as what had already become

00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:39,649
pretty pretty mature in the Netherlands

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,110
there were quite a few people the map

00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:45,439
was already fairly complete in terms of

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,120
like most most things and when I moved

00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:49,579
to the US or was really a sort of an

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,649
eye-opener to me where we started with a

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:54,769
community that was still open to a lot

00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:57,399
of new things and it kind of reminded me

00:11:54,769 --> 00:12:00,319
about this of those early days in osm

00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,350
we're like everything was still kind of

00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:06,199
to be determined and I think we tried

00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:10,279
we've managed to kind of maintain that a

00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:13,189
little bit well still working to build a

00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,170
community that's built on let's built on

00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:17,179
the kind of structure and i think ian is

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,670
it had a few pretty good examples of how

00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:27,680
we do how we do that as a board shall we

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:29,149
start that video ok so I say

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,339
sorry I couldn't be there to experience

00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,870
day of the map in person but I look

00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:35,080
forward to watching the videos and

00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,029
hearing from you all on the internet

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,100
I've been a part of the OpenStreetMap us

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,770
organization in some ways since it was

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,720
started back in 2010 in the year since

00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,370
we've tried lots of different things and

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,250
had dozens of people participate

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,660
directly in board activities each of

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,580
those people added something to the

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,230
organization but we need to make sure

00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,020
that we keep track of what worked and

00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:59,390
what didn't to that end I want to talk

00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,089
about how openstreetmap us sustains

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:04,370
itself through documentation the

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:06,320
OpenStreetMap us board tries to meet

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,690
weekly and one of us will take detailed

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,790
notes about what we talked about usually

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,550
Drishti does the note-taking and she

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,529
does a great job those detailed meeting

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,480
notes go into a folder on github and

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,399
become searchable by the rest of the

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,020
board they're helpful when we're trying

00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,540
to understand the context around

00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:26,660
decisions or discussions that happen in

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,040
the past they also from the basis for

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,029
the minutes that we publish on the

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,200
OpenStreetMap wiki after every meeting

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,930
sometimes we'll go the other direction

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,300
and use github tickets to have more

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,400
in-depth asynchronous discussion about a

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,630
decision we need to make before we meet

00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:46,580
face-to-face as a treasurer I spend a

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,620
lot of time outside our regular meetings

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,200
maintaining accounting books and making

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,000
sure we pay our bills on time this can

00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,339
be very time-consuming especially around

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,200
state of the map us so paying for

00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,500
knowledgeable people to help you with

00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,200
that is very useful look for accountants

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,360
lawyers bookkeepers assistants and event

00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,209
coordinators to help you stay sane while

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,120
running the organization remember as a

00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:13,610
member of the OpenStreetMap us board my

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,980
first job is to promote openstreetmap in

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:19,190
the united states not get burned out on

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,560
the Nitty Gritty of accounting another

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,510
aspect of sustainability is making sure

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,220
your successors and fellow board members

00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,399
can continue to run the organization

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,440
without relying on you for help be sure

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,060
to securely share passwords and be

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,670
liberal with access to important

00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,200
information about the organization more

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,170
than one person should be able to access

00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,930
the bank social media email and server

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,940
accounts for

00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:44,760
organization in case the one person that

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,040
has access can't be reached in software

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,260
engineering we call this the bus factor

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,380
it refers to how many people could

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:55,110
disappear or more morbidly get hit by a

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,990
bus before the organization would come

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,600
to a standstill because knowledge or

00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,240
day-to-day activities and access would

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,690
disappear with those people if you find

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,690
yourself in

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:16,470
problem to solve this document the

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,660
answers to people's questions and point

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,160
them to your documentation if your

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,560
documentation doesn't answer their

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,050
question then their documentation isn't

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,790
good enough this means you have to spend

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,310
a seemingly absurd amount of time

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,410
rewriting everything down but it also

00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,150
means your organization will survive if

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,100
you disappear or can't answer because

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,260
you've escaped to the deep woods of

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,290
Canada after a reality TV star has

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,910
become president of your country in

00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:44,280
summary document everything for

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,410
posterity keep note of what worked and

00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,690
what didn't when running your events or

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,450
meetings or meetups use this information

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,730
when you make decisions in the future

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:56,010
also use the documentation to help your

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,620
organization run more efficiently and to

00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,240
keep yourself sane be as open as you can

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,940
with your board members so that you're

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,700
not the only person with the keys to

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,650
everything thanks for having us and

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,140
please feel free to reach out to me at

00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:19,980
en diez on twitter or ian at

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:23,150
openstreetmap us thank you that was in

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:31,010
how I don't know how we are on time but

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:34,700
it's let me what is it yeah we can take

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,700
we can take a little bit

00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:44,249
we got a lot of requests from people on

00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:46,619
the local level right so where people

00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:49,829
just want to organize something people

00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:51,989
want to have want to have a little bit

00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:54,749
of money to attend the conference and

00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:57,179
speak about osm we get these requests

00:16:54,749 --> 00:17:00,720
quite a lot and so we're currently

00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:04,350
working on a number of pretty simple

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,819
policies for for having for giving

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,220
people a little small amounts of money

00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:10,049
to do these things and this has really

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,760
worked very well in the few in the few

00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:14,100
times we've already done it so that's

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,959
something I definitely would encourage

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,880
other people to try as well it's also

00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,939
one of the things that there's been that

00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,130
has been successful for us so one of

00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,449
these and these are these are these are

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,639
some of the real benefits that we give

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:28,769
to to members and that may be why we

00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:30,899
have so many of them we have almost 500

00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:34,169
members of the u.s. chapter which is

00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:35,789
about on par with osm foundation about a

00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:37,399
hundred and fifty hundred and sixty of

00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:39,539
them are also members of the foundation

00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:41,070
so we have a lot of dual membership

00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,320
which is something I think is also

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,940
important because when we are when we

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,600
are going to support local chapters

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,820
we're also going to be one one that want

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,350
that the knowledge of their experience

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,409
from all those local chapters were all

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:59,120
different to trickle up to kind of the

00:17:55,409 --> 00:18:01,289
OpenStreetMap central kind of

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,809
organization or the project as a whole

00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,580
so we can all learn from each other and

00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:07,830
that's also i think tomorrow there's

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,620
going to be as part of the workshop day

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:13,110
we will have the local chapters meeting

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,090
where i hope some of this learning can

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,919
start to happen or not start to happen

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,480
because it's already happening but where

00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,649
we can have the opportunity to all be

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,789
together and talk about these things

00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:28,049
finally I don't think we have time for

00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:30,690
another video but like it's about six

00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:33,570
minutes yeah I think that what we'll do

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:36,200
is we'll post this on our blog so you

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,200
can see the original

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:44,910
material but like to summarize Drishti

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:47,890
um who is a secretary I'm on the board

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:52,840
she is a newest member to openstreetmap

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:54,730
us and the and the board and she is one

00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,580
of the kind of leaders between missing

00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:00,070
maps and so she talks about you know one

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,900
of the things that we kind of balance

00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,240
both within the community but also

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:08,170
represented in the board is a certain

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,450
amount of diversity three of the five

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:13,300
board members were originally from

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:16,500
different countries and there's a two

00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:19,840
women on the board myself included and

00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,690
we have a pretty diverse like you know

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,060
community of mappers and as represented

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,310
by at the conference and so she talks

00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,910
about like what the kind of perspective

00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:34,090
of being like a new contributor to the

00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:37,690
community and to the the board what that

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:42,150
looks like and and we as other board

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:44,140
members we have made sure that her

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,750
perspective and her voice is just as

00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:49,240
valued and as anybody else who's on the

00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,610
board and then Alex talks about like

00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,040
communication styles that kind of growth

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,260
of the OpenStreetMap community and the

00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,260
state of the map conference and how our

00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:02,470
kind of investment in time and how we

00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,690
structure its success stay and map us I

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,390
hope I said that um we can take

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,320
questions because that's just as useful

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:13,150
otherwise we can I continue to ramble

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,930
thank you for the contribution are there

00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,930
any questions from the audience

00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:22,429
yep question over here

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,660
so you touched on this a little bit but

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:37,070
the u.s. is a huge country very diverse

00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:40,100
how is that what kind of difficulties

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,990
does that pose for open street maps USA

00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:48,440
and then how do how is that diversity of

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:50,390
may be a force for success one dimension

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,000
of it is certainly geographical so

00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:57,020
everything is well as you as a X

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,840
European it struck me that like when if

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,970
I wanted to travel to an osm event I

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,460
pretty much have to organize one myself

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,220
because everything is always like the

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:11,720
closest other city to my to to where I

00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:15,350
live is 600 kilometers away so and

00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,210
there's nothing in between so if there

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,650
if anything is going to happen in terms

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,570
of events for me then I'll have to

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,280
organise something so that's why I feel

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,170
so strongly about supporting people who

00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,760
want to organize things I mean I live in

00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,710
the desert not all people are so far

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,200
apart but it's definitely not uncommon

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,820
for people to fo be far apart our

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,309
previous speakers also he's probably

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,990
pretty close to me but he's also in the

00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:41,210
same situation he lives in the desert as

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:42,920
well so this is a challenge that that's

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,960
the geographical part of it maybe Alyssa

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:49,280
you want to address the diversity

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:52,340
challenge that we have sure I mean I

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,800
think I think fundamentally I'm all of

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:58,970
us see it as a strength and a

00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:02,140
contribution and something that we hope

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:05,179
to support that all these diverse

00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:07,190
communities have a voice in the

00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:09,530
structure and the and the growth in the

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,660
leadership of the community but it's

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:14,780
clear that it's also a challenge like an

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,610
geographic diversity is a big one I

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,940
think that what we're interested in

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,990
doing and Martin can talk more about

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:25,040
what we hope is next for the

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:28,670
OpenStreetMap US leadership and

00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:31,160
community and I think that you know we

00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:32,600
do help to support one conference a year

00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,480
like the large state of the map US

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,029
Conference but there's increasing effort

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,859
to really make

00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:43,399
like have have a learning at a more

00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:46,639
local level to support support what is

00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:50,169
happening at the at these smaller like

00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:56,830
you know easily works easily accessible

00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:59,239
communities as well any more questions I

00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:02,029
will say also though the diversity of

00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:04,609
actors so is really important so it's

00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:06,109
not just like types of people but I mean

00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:09,139
I think it's been really valuable for

00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:11,479
the US community to have large companies

00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:16,099
which may not be you know historically

00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:19,399
the way openstreetmap US open stream up

00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:21,229
as organization sees itself or considers

00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:23,289
itself but it's it's been valuable to

00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:27,200
have them as voices as well as

00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:31,089
governments as well as a regional

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,799
volunteers like that diversity of

00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:36,919
perspective is something else that we

00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:40,009
attempt to balance at the board level

00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:43,039
but but I think again we find it like

00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:46,070
fundamentally a contribution and

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,299
something that even if it's hard it's

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,869
something that we continue to work

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:52,070
towards because we want lots of

00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:54,039
different types of people and

00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:59,469
perspectives like involved in the work

00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:59,469
and using the work do

00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:12,150
every really cool um it's one of the

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:17,480
women want to ask a question um I'm

00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:19,710
encinal so just just think about it um

00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,050
thank you for the talk a very

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:26,910
interesting you mentioned under the

00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:28,350
successes the idea of affiliations I was

00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:33,840
wondering if you could maybe elaborate

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:35,550
timely on that affiliation yeah there's

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,830
a there's a few things that are have

00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:42,390
been successful so it was quite a few of

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:45,950
the board members have been talking at

00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:48,930
speaking at a very at for example

00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,880
government conferences where where a lot

00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,200
of government GIS folks show up and some

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,940
interesting collaborations have been

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,310
have been made out of that the recent

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,670
example is where I spoke at a at a

00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:03,120
conference that that had transportation

00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:05,850
GIS people from all over the US and we

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,630
set up an interesting map Roulette

00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:11,700
challenge related to to to

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,200
infrastructure in Texas that is still

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,730
evolving we started with something

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,380
really simple but those are some

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,730
interesting collaborations or people are

00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,110
really starting to get interested in

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,020
using all of them as well from the

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:25,190
government level not only giving data

00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,690
because in the US data is very liberally

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,720
distributed from the government side but

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:32,490
also starting to get interested in to

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,500
some of these crowdsourcing which is

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,360
very very strange word to them in a very

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,410
strange concept and but getting used to

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,270
that and getting used to the whole

00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,770
Pacific net way of doing things so

00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:45,200
that's yeah that's one example there's

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:48,180
more okay unfortunately our time is up

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,890
so I would like to thank you for a

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,160
contribution like thank our speakers

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,160
again

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,290
