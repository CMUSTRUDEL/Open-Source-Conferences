Anyone who has edited OpenStreetMap (OSM) has used DigitalGlobe imagery; they might not realize it, they might refer to it as “Bing” or “Nextview”, but all OSM users are DigitalGlobe users.

DigitalGlobe is the team who are building, launching, operating and provisioning high resolution, accurate images that power OSM. Just days ago we launched of our newest satellite: WorldView-04, which will ensure data continuity for the next decade. This talk will cover how DigitalGlobe will continue to innovate and provide data to OSM that will allow OSM to go to the next level in terms of relevant coverage and detail. It will also cover DigitalGlobe’s Open Data initiative and ecosystem of partners in the Geo industry.

	00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:10,050
good afternoon everyone first of all

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,950
thank you sorry I'll turn out to do that

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,949
again was at me like I won't move during

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,869
this entire presentation thing I just

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,109
want to say thank you to the sajjad and

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,369
the matte box team for the work they do

00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:25,320
I'm probably one of the people who

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:29,189
screwed up once or twice I was hoping I

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:33,390
wouldn't be outed on your but it's

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:37,020
important right so I wanted to sort of

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,350
break the ice today by stepping into the

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,440
confession booth and admitting some of

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,320
my faults of about a thousand things

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,730
going through my head right now based on

00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,039
everything that I've learned and the

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,640
conversations I've had so I'll try to be

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,770
as coherent as I as a candidate I wrote

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,079
a pretty bad abstract for this

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,090
conference I sort of mailed it in

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,149
because i was traveling and I didn't

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,949
have time and I didn't make the original

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,720
cut they didn't want me up here I was

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,580
kind of on the bubble but thankfully

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,810
they made room for me so thank you

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:16,890
organizers one of the things I screwed

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,990
up was I mistakenly predicted that our

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,869
latest satellite would be up in space

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,540
right now collecting data it's still on

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,750
the ground so apologies for that I'll

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,479
talk a little bit more about that later

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,310
another confession I'm a huge space nerd

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,890
and I don't know if that's controversial

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,079
or not because I know open street maps a

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,030
terrestrial project so we map things on

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,939
the earth but i'm very interested in

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,229
celestial thing so i'm going to talk a

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,100
little bit about space today if that's

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:50,880
okay i still have a couple more i have a

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,299
list here my presentation might be a

00:01:50,880 --> 00:02:00,210
little controversial so apologies in

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:02,850
advance last i'm a gamer so late at

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,890
night after the kids are asleep while my

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,580
wife is watching The Real Housewives of

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,220
whatever city I'll go up and play xbox

00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:13,260
that's my outlet the thing I like about

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,540
it is you can level up when you

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,370
are there any gamers out here raise your

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,250
hand all right few gamers alright cool

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,599
in good company you level up and I love

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,349
that concept and there's a lot of

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,750
gamification in osm which is great but I

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,569
believe osm has leveled up in the past

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:34,260
few years I wish we kept track of it but

00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:36,180
the observation i had and this is where

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,090
I ended my state of the map us talk and

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,579
I'll start there is I've seen so much

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,579
activity in the past 12 months I've been

00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:47,099
around osm for about five years and when

00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:50,280
I started first started working on it it

00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:52,200
was at that time scene is pretty much a

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,389
hobby well it's grown up into something

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,099
that's much more of a hobby and it was

00:02:54,389 --> 00:03:00,299
being used all around the world for

00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:03,090
incredibly important initiative so to

00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:06,239
give an example I was asked by a CEO of

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,620
a company recently a US company who

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,430
asked me what is open street map in

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,370
mikkel kind of references in his talk I

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,540
think we all have different explanations

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,129
so I wanted to be as quick into the

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,799
point it's a database of the earth

00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,989
features and it's created by users

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,819
that's it I mean it's much more than

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:25,560
that but I wanted that person to

00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,650
remember it so I didn't want to go on

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,370
for ten minutes uh so the person asked

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,629
me well is it done and I said no well

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,799
when's it going to be done and I said

00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:39,180
never not applicable um by the way all

00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,349
like since this whole thing that's

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,730
creative common so if you want to take

00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:46,560
it use it that's fine add it's never

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:51,120
going to be done the earth changes every

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,480
single day right and so my job at

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,090
digital globe we collect imagery of the

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,060
earth every single day not the entire

00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:05,720
but large portions of the earth and to

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:09,359
me imagery is a staple for economic not

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,669
edit us am without imagery and I don't

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,409
know if that's with me might be this me

00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,289
but I feel like it's really important

00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:18,359
and I feel like it's almost like Wi-Fi

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,500
or electricity you don't realize how

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:25,550
important it is until it's not there ah

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,550
can anyone relate that today

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:33,350
so I did a little research recently I

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,450
found this wiki page on armchair mapping

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,370
and this is how I knew my presentation

00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,940
is going to be controversial because the

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,760
wiki page told means give me controversy

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,830
this is the you can go to this link it

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,110
literally said aren't your mapping is

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:53,030
controversial and not widely accepted as

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,590
a good idea so that means a narrow

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,500
portion of community believes it's a

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,970
good idea and most of the community

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,360
believes it's vanity and controversial

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,580
not only that but tells you what normal

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,980
mapping is there to abnormal mapping

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,170
which is our German so I get some

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,050
abnormal but that's okay and we all have

00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:16,430
our opinions and that's ok as well it's

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:21,919
great so that caused me to think a lot

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:28,550
about my life thank you whoever wrote

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:30,500
that um Matt box guys are fantastic box

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,720
guides have a little different

00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,740
perspective and they stay the

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,450
availability of high-resolution

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,240
satellite imagery it's a lot of lessons

00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,880
data volume to explode good explosion

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,970
I'm standing right meaning it's

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,320
pervasive we can add things we do work

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,060
from home we don't have to be on the

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,830
field when it's an emergency on the

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,540
other side of the earth we can all

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,780
contribute we don't have to be where the

00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:56,200
emergency is it's really easy and fast

00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,960
going to what 7th grade teachers Madrid

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,070
so output on that perspective

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,860
interesting so we have different

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:08,229
perspectives so here's how to bike trail

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:13,220
in erie colorado where I'm from and

00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:16,190
whether this was a GPS trace or traits

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,380
from imagery imagery helped me make sure

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:22,910
that I didn't just put this on Nalle

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:25,220
island or Pacific Ocean wherever because

00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:29,660
I'm not that smart I can state yet I got

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:32,930
it um and even if I traced it I think I

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,940
still value their scope a master mustard

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,590
actually sort of kicked off this

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,780
presentation I've really enjoyed it his

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,880
presentation and

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,400
about this battle he was having with a

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,020
local contributor because he was having

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,320
features and that contributed was

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,400
looking at old imagery and deleting it

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,760
so I think this is a problem we can

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:56,380
actually solve together so my question

00:06:51,760 --> 00:07:13,030
is if anyone's feeling brave where does

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:15,310
this imagery come from I did not I don't

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,850
even I don't know if we've met i'm kevin

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:21,220
that was not rehearsed so yeah a lot of

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,830
imagery comes from space i get to the

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,050
made your day with that right some

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,390
imagery comes from the air repair

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,740
crafter babies but i wanted to talk a

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,890
little bit about space and a warranty

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:37,690
this is coming so this is a circular

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:39,460
based in an unknown system daddy that's

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,380
first order to program just kidding just

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,380
making sure he was paying attention what

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,440
you are a by the way a lot of Star Wars

00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,410
obviously that whole film is about

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,919
mapping you know that hopefully I didn't

00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:56,200
spoil anything but locations ingrained

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,320
in the entire plot of the movie back to

00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,070
the real space this time this is what

00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,970
space looks like from Hubble telescope I

00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:08,169
am absolutely fascinated in humans

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,560
achievements up in space and it started

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:15,220
but Nick this is an early Atlas rocket

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,870
that was launching the seventies if you

00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,150
believe that we've sent someone to the

00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,620
moon there's a picture of it I happen to

00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,160
believe that but a lot of people don't

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:26,770
want some then we went to Skylab build

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,960
space shuttles we have iOS tasks these

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,690
are amazing achievements we're

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,020
continuing now with Juno mission Rosetta

00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:37,120
which is by the essay and Osiris Rex

00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,190
which is gonna go take a sample that's

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,580
right this stuff absolutely fascinates

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:45,040
me I could do it off on that but I want

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,120
to save it first paper

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,890
one of things that fascinates means

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,440
we've failed more times and we succeeded

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:55,070
we have blown a lot of things up and

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,500
people died and things a bit lost if we

00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,560
we've learned a lot from that I think as

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,050
developers and people who are watching

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,760
tools and projects we can all relate

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,490
that like you have to fail 10 times

00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,750
before you can succeed if you don't

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,160
believe me watch a movie called the

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,930
right side please put watch out with one

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,460
of the things right stuff we're doing

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,950
we're trying to launch this system

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,420
called the hexagon and this was recently

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:25,870
Declassified and it's really fascinating

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:27,950
this is a massive 60 foot long piece of

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,830
spy equipment and with launching the

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:33,820
Cold War that used film this was in the

00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:36,650
seventh so no digital cameras no

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,720
communication 250 and actually had a

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,600
cassette remember cassette like few

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,440
tests so they've got your roll film take

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:50,330
pictures this entire unit it's fun to

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:53,330
keep its momentum and stability and when

00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:57,950
the film was used up and ready to be

00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:00,320
developed they dropped it that's what

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,510
you did in the 70s so you created

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,360
heat-resistant shield you drop the film

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:08,750
and you didn't want to drop it onto your

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:15,100
enemy's territory so you would fly over

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:17,750
the parachute and scoop it up true story

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:22,240
you can read about that as well things

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:24,890
have changed so fast-forward 40 years

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,200
this is digital Globes latest satellite

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:31,330
her name is world before she has a

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,330
Durandal don't be shy and follower

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:39,860
things have changed technology's changed

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:42,470
we build large satellite these are not

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,089
microsatellites sorry to disappoint if

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,220
you're wanting to what about Microsoft

00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:48,640
these are big satellites and the reason

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,890
we do that is to get the accuracy

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,710
resolution the agility that we need for

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,790
mapping and other times many other

00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:01,010
things we need big platform

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,380
so accuracy were worried about plus or

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,960
minus three meters which is better than

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:09,470
the GPS signal on your phone about

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,440
equivalent like a garmin gps resolution

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,480
this means the cyberking someone can

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,209
resolve on the ground and ability and

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,510
I'm apologies for my very American

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:22,730
reference to Texas but I did conversion

00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:26,330
there's about 23 belgium's / Texas in

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:29,690
Siberia so I went on to the converter

00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:32,540
calm and figured it out Myanmar's also

00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:35,660
about the same size of Texas so to look

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,940
at what this looks like in scale there's

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:41,420
a person there's some microsatellites

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:45,260
and one on the very right is one of our

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:47,510
satellites why do we do this um we can

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,779
we can take advantage of latest

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,839
technologies in circuits and components

00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:56,930
and software but unfortunately we can't

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,820
change the laws of physics not at least

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,620
this galaxy making another galaxy

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,630
physics might work differently so

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,150
physics is constant and there's a

00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:08,209
constant formula to calculating

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:11,089
resolution and it's actually easy and

00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:14,900
fun for a super nerd like me to go do

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:18,950
this so I calculated the resolution of a

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:21,080
400 millimeter nikon SLR on the space

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,480
station flying at 400 kilometers in

00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,029
space that's what the top one is laughs

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,040
at its next line says very similar

00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:32,390
Sentinel in its focal length and its

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,310
orbit high are this is broadly three the

00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:39,620
third one down with a focal length of 15

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:46,579
meters anyone's a photographer 16 meters

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:48,079
is a very powerful lens and then last is

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:49,910
that the bottom with a different a

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,110
different system with a different focal

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,290
length and these things can all work

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:57,200
together in harmony these are not

00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,610
similar technologies to put it in

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,250
business terms these are not competing

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,620
technologies so I actually wanted to

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,540
create an example this event Cooper I'm

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,550
from Canada so I wanted to choose a

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,010
Canadian example sorry about that is

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,959
very selfishly factor if it's a great

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,450
city though and this is what it looks

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,040
like from the space station and

00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,230
unfortunately as you two men things

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,850
begin pixelate and as we all know from

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,089
looking at Lance pad and sending the

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,010
data X lading wrap sternum injury is not

00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:27,650
very helpful when we want to go map to

00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,900
the line of a road or sidewalk or

00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,370
whatever you want to map so you can

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:36,650
paint landside imagery is a little bit

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:37,959
better zoom in pixelated ok jump up so

00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,360
this is the final lap symmetry of

00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:43,459
Vancouver again and thanks to men it

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,500
gets a little excited so now I'm gonna

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:47,570
pull in a digital globe image and now I

00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,000
can actually see lane markings on the

00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:53,750
road I can actually zoom in you can see

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,520
vehicles and the high resolution allows

00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,800
me to digitize those features this is

00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,709
this is what we've all been used to

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:05,810
thanks to google earth and a mountain

00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:08,810
got maps definitely now Apple maps map

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:11,690
Fox out like we used to this stuff and

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,730
this is the business that a little bit

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:18,709
is to continue to maintain and

00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:22,070
collective imagery from having um one

00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:23,630
example are used in terms of agility I

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,910
you to the Texas example so use

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,430
something different our satellites are

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,709
maneuverable and in order to maneuver we

00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,839
have massive control mode gyros ever

00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:36,140
done that experiment we sit on a swivel

00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:42,470
chair able to bike into the bike tire

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:45,110
then return it like this that's your

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,329
angular momentum moving around so we

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,220
have that on our satellite so as a fun

00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:53,930
experiment we're flying over the

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:57,430
Atlantic Ocean that the little Hamilton

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:59,959
you see that's Bermuda up for me

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:02,029
nonprofits community so we're way up in

00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,160
the am planning about 2,000 kilometers

00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:06,560
away from New York City is it clear

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,529
sunny day in January New York City so we

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,880
decided to take a look and we saw new

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:16,550
york and new jersey and going island and

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,890
staten island and everything in the

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,680
scene from two thousand dollars away and

00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,960
we could actually see it

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,180
Stephanie centimeter resolution from

00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,210
that distance that's an example of what

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,490
they want focal length locating we can

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:33,010
actually actually we actually count taxi

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,110
cabs on the street the building right in

00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:38,050
the middle is the UN where everyone was

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:40,240
last year so this kind of a novel

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:43,480
example you're thinking all kind of just

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,440
showing off but this has real

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,500
applications we do this not to this

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,450
extreme but we do it every single day

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,690
best example had was in the posterior

00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:58,870
kind of dude after the earthquake it if

00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:01,899
if you all remember it was rainy for

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,149
like three or four days straight this is

00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:07,120
the blog from my good friend charlie I

00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:09,459
always referenced Charlie Lloyd work in

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,950
all my presentations so thank you

00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:13,810
Charlie how does the blog post he wrote

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,910
about how cloudy but so he looked at the

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:18,670
imagery we were collecting vs Landsat

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:21,100
data absolutely pavia weatherford Paul

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:25,029
of course thousands of people were

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:27,520
buried work need relief efforts are

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:30,040
underway everybody in the world was

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:34,180
asking us perimetry not everybody but it

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:37,360
felt like a lot of people so we flew

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:42,160
over nepal cloudy over babe dash we flew

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,660
into Indian Ocean cloudy I don't know

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,279
what happened there I'll heard it

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,410
there's a hole in a cloud we took a

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,890
picture and that picture is the one

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:53,350
you're looking at on the right can I do

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,820
it was amazing there's a hole in the

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,310
clouds right above cat man who we saw

00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:00,270
with of the picture and we published it

00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:04,480
with an open license and people web apps

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:06,910
that's great an example of having an

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:12,010
agile satellite can really change the

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:16,689
world just a term Lu space is hard we're

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:19,030
going this very very real right now this

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:21,130
is us shipping our satellite from

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:24,010
seinfeld california to Santa Barbara and

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:26,050
a police escort and reason educated

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,809
escort is because a drunk driver ran a

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:31,080
to our please escort so the police took

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:34,260
them out and didn't hit our satellite

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,260
which is important to us we get it to

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:40,529
the Air Force Base we loaded in a big

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,419
fairing then we tip the fairing across

00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:45,080
the Air Force Base this whole process

00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:49,260
takes days and days and days and weeks

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:52,730
lift it up about 25 stories we put on

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:56,490
top of rocket get the rocket ready to go

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:59,190
there is we were going to launch this on

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,200
such number 16 we roll back the tower

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,240
we're 20 minutes from launching the

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,019
countdown was about to begin the

00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,510
champagne was on ice and what the

00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,940
facility looks like everything's ready

00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,889
to go you keep the oxygen liquid oxygen

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:19,950
liquid hydrogen you don't wanna make

00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:21,630
those things like about that show um do

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,850
your thing the fire comes out is right

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,070
there fire comes of the bottom even one

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:28,289
fire coming out of any other place when

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,269
you're all set and ready to go we one of

00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:32,460
the people on the base noticed to

00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:35,269
something that was that one as a small

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:41,940
leak in one of the fueling systems so we

00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:44,940
saw they called scrub scrub all um that

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,850
fire broke out a forest fire sweet i

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,730
scrub another launch and my any thing is

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,669
getting to space is hard right space is

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:56,130
heart of getting two spaces are so work

00:18:53,669 --> 00:19:00,750
Marshall company one government we don't

00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:03,870
get taxpayer funding yes a NASA get

00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:06,149
taxpayer funding which is nice we don't

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,039
get x para findings to work business and

00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:10,860
I'm often asked what is your business

00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:15,169
model solve it in 60 seconds because if

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,169
they only have like 120 seconds left

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:26,200
we prayed money in order to launch

00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:28,929
satellites and build ground systems we

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,179
take that data and we created a GIS and

00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:34,320
platforms of tools if anyone's

00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:38,110
interested in those go to developer got

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,360
the mother we licensed our content and

00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,429
we licensed are content to companies

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,710
such as these and organizes

00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:48,040
organizations around the world NGOs

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:51,550
government's and they essentially pay us

00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,620
for our data and we don't we take that

00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:56,500
money invested in new satellites that's

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:59,440
a cycle this has worked for us for a

00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,000
decade and a half satellites don't last

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,210
forever so our plan is to keep on

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,300
getting list and launch more talent so

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:12,100
that openstreetmap has first 13 to trace

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:15,130
from or get validation lastly there's

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:19,150
always exceptions to the rule so there

00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:21,130
have been many times where be steady

00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,230
know what that is let's pause at this

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,900
model for a second let's open our data I

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:29,679
mentioned Paul this year we open up

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:32,260
Ecuador um it as an example the other

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,660
made the mapathon it looks fantastic at

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:39,150
Doctors Without Borders to build its

00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:42,100
able to donate submit matreya the DRC

00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,679
which is great because it gets everyone

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:47,559
involved it allows easy access and this

00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:49,870
is a part of the world where there was

00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:52,090
no good coverage no high-resolution

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:56,679
satellite so we were able to augment and

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:58,960
and help out so that's the end of my

00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,250
presentation that's hopefully that gave

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,870
you an overview of what we're all about

00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:06,460
what we do yes we are a business but

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,440
that shouldn't scare anyone cuz we're

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,540
like real people with real feelings as

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,650
well so thank you for coming I

00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,650
appreciate it I'll take any questions

00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:31,840
thank you for a presentation first

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:34,800
question in the back how often can you

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:42,610
move two satellites as it requires fuel

00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:45,070
video let's run absolutely yeah okay

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,530
good question so the movement is

00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,300
actually done with those gyros but we

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,190
need a low enough for bed that grab

00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,320
these actually pulling us down so the

00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:57,160
fuel we use is actually a booster orbit

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,740
so every few days we're using fuel which

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:03,310
are solid backup it back the higher

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:06,700
orbit once we a quick bird which was our

00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:08,080
original satellite ran fuel and she got

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,810
really close into some very

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:15,730
high-resolution images before it burned

00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:17,230
up the and by the way we use hydrazine

00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:21,550
as our fuel which is like one of those

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:23,430
volatile really dangerous before launch

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:27,940
it's a last thing we do as we feel it up

00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:30,280
um with technology today our satellites

00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:34,060
have enough fuel to actually out live

00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:38,100
other components on the satellite so

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:41,710
satellite goes through a lot of rough

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:44,380
exposure to temperature so on the tight

00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,630
side of the earth it had about 70 70

00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,180
degrees Celsius on the dark side of the

00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:52,120
earth of negative 70 degree Celsius and

00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:55,150
does that 15 times a day to its enduring

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:58,120
a temperature flocks of 140 degrees 15

00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,920
times a day at least seventy thousand

00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,350
times over it's like that that's gonna

00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,070
ruin things before we run out of fuel

00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,070
for those food

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:20,190
so what fraction of the earth has this

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:22,860
high resolution imaging and aiming for

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:25,620
full coverage and are there are areas

00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:28,800
where your duty multiple passes not a

00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,480
great question um we've covered the

00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,970
entire world with high resolution

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,390
imagery now the question is how old is

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:38,760
it some of the images we collected a

00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,950
couple millions per convert today of

00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:46,950
imagery and we do about 23 million

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:48,660
square kilometers pay and really what

00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,080
comes down to is what is the weather

00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:55,050
like the thing that prevents us from

00:23:52,080 --> 00:24:00,030
collecting more and keeping more the

00:23:55,050 --> 00:24:02,220
world update or clouds and pollution so

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:04,440
what fraction the world is covered one

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:08,790
hundred percent and what does the other

00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,470
one what fractions updated 3d in 250

00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:13,380
whatever that some other calculators

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:15,300
about three million a 250 million square

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:21,210
kilometer per 50 million tell the line

00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:28,950
that's cute hey what about videos from

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:30,750
satellites great life yeah so we are you

00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,210
familiar with like stop-motion

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:35,310
photography or move something big

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,780
fixture and it all together we get out

00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:39,030
with our satellites don't weep we've

00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,750
actually been able to do it's not

00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:45,510
streaming video but we go over a target

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:48,830
and take stock cha-cha-cha three dots

00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:50,940
together great a night and a gift

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,620
satellite pass them over if you do it on

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,740
like a tall tower you see the top of

00:24:52,620 --> 00:25:00,570
tower you know changements its angle

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:04,500
toward the satellite I'm so we're not

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:07,050
doing video what we found is it's

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:10,860
interesting but it's not a good use of

00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:13,890
resource there's the use cases of all of

00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:16,100
the video you could fly over London and

00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:18,350
show the traffic

00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,799
the cars moving in London or whatever

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,600
the pick your favorite City but

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:26,870
street-based cameras are better than

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,000
that because it takes time to pay all

00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,100
those images find a ground station down

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,750
like all of that data bring it back to

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,090
the data center process it it might be

00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,970
two hours old in it who cares to me a

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,380
closed circuit TV that's much better the

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,230
video is something that's interesting

00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:45,640
you just they're really frosted lease it

00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,640
really hasn't been much goodnight for

00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:55,900
somewhat related to the quick receptors

00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:09,860
sense for other types of sense okay

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:11,210
other sensors so our sensors are sensing

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,150
wavelengths and I didn't talk about

00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:17,320
wavelength but we don't were not find

00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,320
radar sensors

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,480
little wavelengths that are reflected

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:30,539
off the Earth's surface so we're what's

00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,309
interesting to us is RGB red green blue

00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:35,610
with a human eye can see the worst

00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:37,740
wrecks cannabis to clean non visible

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,779
wavelengths that are infrared and

00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,740
multi-spectral and that's really

00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:43,860
interesting when you're starting to

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:48,809
analyze agriculture forestry the health

00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:50,250
of coral reef fire boundaries in that

00:26:48,809 --> 00:27:06,270
sort of thing so i don't know if i can

00:26:50,250 --> 00:27:10,640
say we can what do you do

00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:14,580
about the ocean take pictures actually

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,840
yeah so most of the world is an ocean so

00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:21,450
we spend a lot of time above the ocean

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,140
work we're doing some things where we're

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,140
trying to measure

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:34,340
actually Matt ocean floor bottoms and

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,110
coral reefs which is an interest like a

00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:43,820
really good use case over water we can

00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:45,680
also look for ships and illegal things

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,830
that are going on in the ocean one

00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,450
example and if tenir is my colleague

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,220
here if you want a really good example

00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,710
you can tell the story better than I but

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,720
we worked with The Associated Press last

00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,770
year and they want to Pulitzer Prize for

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:04,370
exposing some slaves that were being

00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:05,690
held on fishing fishing vessels and we

00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,460
actually weren't able to track them with

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,250
our satellites and we actually have like

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,740
photographic evidence of slaves being

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:15,320
transferred between ships and the people

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:17,930
who are doing that are now in prison so

00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,390
we're actually able to save people using

00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:22,040
our technology over the ocean and that

00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:24,470
was my ten second version too near can

00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:29,780
give you the 20 minute version and it's

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:32,480
way better trust me hi there great talk

00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:35,240
by the way and what I'd love to be able

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,670
to see is how road networks and evolved

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,230
over time and we commonly do that and

00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,060
openstreetmap moment because obviously

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,070
the dates when it's being edited and put

00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,290
it in but so we need satellite imagery

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,480
as far as I can see to do that so I was

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:50,000
wondering if in the future there be a

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,010
possibility to use your imagery maybe in

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,710
an engine because I can't possibly

00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:56,780
download it all and buy it you know but

00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:00,050
actually to determine when the roads

00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:02,930
were created yeah so if I understand

00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:04,880
your question analyzing imagery to see

00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,920
when roads are being built or changed

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,920
yeah and this is happening all over the

00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,990
world the main street I used to get to

00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,540
my neighborhood is widening going from a

00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,460
single lane to a two lane each way and

00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:21,920
that's really interesting for a lot of

00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:25,580
applications the an enhancement we need

00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,560
to make is in so for every image digit

00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,660
lobe takes we have a hundred lines of

00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,910
metadata about that image down to the

00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:34,610
millisecond when it was acquired and all

00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:36,470
the conditions that day that information

00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:39,840
as you all probably know is not being

00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:44,400
propagated into ID editor

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,750
as an example not only that so the

00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,309
metadata is available we're not

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,760
propagating it but that's a problem we

00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:53,669
can solve not only that but we actually

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,700
keep historical imagery so we've been

00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:58,590
collecting imagery since 1999 it's all

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,870
available in our archives so if you go

00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,880
look over any part of the world you not

00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:05,549
only see an image from the last year or

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,440
so but you'll see every image we've ever

00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:12,289
taken to do that sort of analysis we

00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,990
we've actually launched a program in a

00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:18,360
plot for meeeeee we call it geospatial

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:21,419
big data but it enables that sort of

00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:25,409
analysis and starting at the low price

00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:27,299
of free you can jump on and start to

00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:29,909
experiment with some datasets we have I

00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:32,309
think San Francisco and somewhere in

00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:33,960
South Africa where we pushed thousands

00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:35,970
of images on there and so you could

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,860
actually go play around with it and the

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:41,309
point is to do analysis whether it's

00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:44,010
your algorithm or algorithm to actually

00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:45,929
analyze imagery and the changing of

00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:48,809
streets over time is one of the super

00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:50,549
interesting things but we we don't want

00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:52,500
to solve it ourselves so we're inviting

00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:56,370
people to come in and try to solve it

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,620
with us okay unfortunately we're out of

00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:00,779
time so if you've any more questions for

00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,149
kevin i'm sure he'll be happy to respond

00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:04,770
to them and engage in a constructive or

00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:09,330
less constructive discussion during the

00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:10,980
break i would request a very warm

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:14,029
applause for our speaker and thank him

00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,029
