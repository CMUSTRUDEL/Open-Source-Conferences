(Due to technical problems at the venue, the start of the talk was not recorded)

Current news or a popular event in a region may result in a increase in map views. The goal of “Trending Places on OpenStreetMap” is to locate where there is a high viewing activity occurs on the main OpenStreetMap web map. The map consists of many tiles and the views of these tiles are logged daily and following processing the top trending places are tweeted by @trending_places.

Stefan describes the process: For previous 7 days the tile view log is aggregated up to zoom level 14 and a so called T-score is calculated to standardize the data. Values above a certain threshold are filtered out to catch spikes and these are then ranked relative to the mean increase in views overall. Clustering eliminates locations that are near one another. Finally, the tile coordinates are reverse geocoded in order to get geographic names and a Twitter bot announces the top 10.

of iphone or something like this thank

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:17,369
you very much so so this is the t-score

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,060
I can explain later on about how this is

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,750
working it's just a kind of

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:27,750
normalization we are doing here and then

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:31,369
we are looking for spikes so hikes or

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,500
spikes so we are looking for outliers

00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:39,390
always compared to the time window of

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:42,600
seven days which means means the there

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:46,020
is a spike if there is nothing happening

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:52,260
for six days and then we compare the

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:56,460
last day the day the most recent day to

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,879
the six days before and this gives us

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:05,369
some kind of ranking and we are picking

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:08,729
out that most high high ranked top 10

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,549
places which show up in fact we don't

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,880
yet have places we only have tile

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:20,070
numbers which means Center coordinates

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:23,330
or something and so we observed that of

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,470
course sometimes you have clustering of

00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:31,140
tiles meaning autocorrelation in

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:34,229
exchange lists statistics which means if

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,930
you have high activity in one tile the

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,090
probability you have high activity in a

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,590
neighboring tile is very high of course

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:47,040
so we don't want to show all these tiles

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,560
each separately we are trying to cluster

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,649
to a spatially cluster disguise and only

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,270
represent one as a representative of

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:59,969
this claw of this tile cluster then we

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,979
still don't have place names we still

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,640
only have coordinates meaning meaning

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,759
the center coordinates of the ties and

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,050
so we are using nominative to reverse

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:15,370
geocode and

00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:17,800
and looking for names which is in fact

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:21,790
an other challenge which I want to major

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:26,350
mentioned just afterwards and finally if

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:30,690
you have these top 10 names the Twitter

00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:35,740
bot is taking those and tweeting these

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:39,400
place names or in case he couldn't

00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:42,490
receive something or fails otherwise he

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:47,140
at least days that he will come back

00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:51,040
tomorrow hopefully so what the first

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:54,640
thing we realized is some something you

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,750
probably would have expected the this is

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,470
an analysis which have I have taken from

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:05,800
our teen drivers work which I will refer

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:09,940
so we have crow some challenges also

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:14,380
so-called problems in analyzing because

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:18,070
of course we want to avoid bias in fact

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:21,220
there are some some crawling activities

00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:25,780
which are not detected below the radar

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:29,140
of the admins actually and there are

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:34,690
quite some very famous ones of course

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:40,480
who knows what this one is null island

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:43,410
the 00 of course the boy from from them

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:48,970
better weather service at least and

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:52,690
there but there are also other artifacts

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:55,270
which are explainable and then we have

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:59,200
another artifact which is not really

00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:02,290
explain unless you know Sputnik or other

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,170
Russian or a rocket science I don't know

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:09,580
of because in fact it could be something

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:13,000
like a trace from Baikonur I that's just

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:16,090
guessing Wild Wild casting and we also

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,300
have other kind of weird crawling

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:24,160
activities the first one but my student

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,460
Lucas Martinelli you

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:32,170
we know from yesterday found out in his

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:36,940
later time was this kind of analysis of

00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:43,930
lock traces or on level 18 for one for

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:46,660
one day so we have here some some

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:50,530
traffic center we have here the

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:53,110
university an eth of Lausanne I mean

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:56,590
that's just the lake of geneva and I and

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:59,710
its really weird how along highways

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,990
those try see traces appear but at least

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,930
we can assume there are people just

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,330
having online access during their drive

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,330
or something what's what's less

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:16,590
explained and still unexplained are

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:23,040
those kind of how do you call those

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:26,760
comet comet alike traces Martin driver

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:31,600
blocked in his blog post about which are

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:35,170
also still yet unexplained these are the

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,310
references of this early work by

00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:46,810
analyzing the the absolute amount of

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:50,230
views visually another challenge is the

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:53,050
clustering around one single hike or

00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:56,680
spikes or several neighboring spikes so

00:05:53,050 --> 00:06:00,460
I just explained before which shows up

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,970
it would show up like this where we have

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:06,850
almost perfect correlation between those

00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:09,130
coordinates which are simply neighboring

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:14,919
tiling coordinates and this is something

00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:17,680
we can find out and only display one of

00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:22,840
out of four or something just to give

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:26,890
space to real different hikes then a

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:30,690
third challenge is the ranking itself of

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,910
trending places meaning that's a very

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,870
well

00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:39,470
problem in time series analysis that we

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,570
have on one on the left hand with this

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,720
under standard deviations so it's

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:48,230
already normalized but even it's

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,820
normalized we have places where no

00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:55,670
activity is going on these are the days

00:06:51,820 --> 00:07:00,500
so its analysis of around 30 days of one

00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:03,350
months and these are the amount of it is

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,340
the reported count from the dialogues in

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:11,090
steps of 10 because it's zero and then

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:14,840
from 10 adverts it's an integer and so

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:17,600
in this case it's 20 22 and then it's

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,680
zero activity in this style again and

00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,470
then we have a spike here and then we

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,460
have no activity so given we are here

00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:31,550
and this is an obvious spike how do you

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:36,650
correlate how do you compare sorry how

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:41,210
do you compare this to as I say always

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:44,750
to say the tour of eiffel in Paris where

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:50,050
you probably have many many views every

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:54,380
day so it's a linear but it starts with

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:58,450
800 or something goes up to 3000 and

00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:02,630
more and how do you compare those two

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:06,890
because and we won't have a bias we

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:11,600
really want to detect outliers because

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:16,160
of sudden activity so this is some some

00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,860
kind of guessing we had to do to compare

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,130
those of course we normalize all this

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:26,360
stuff but there is still some kind of

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:29,020
coefficient which somehow is our

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:35,030
guessing to make those two activities

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:37,729
comparable the final challenge I want to

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,289
present is as I already said we only

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,790
have coordinates we don't have place

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:45,950
names so and in the case of one

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:49,610
example i will show you will see the

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:52,760
problem all of a sudden because probably

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:55,880
you want to catch the most important

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,070
place nearby or within a bounding box

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,760
nearby the center coordinate or within

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:05,120
this given bounding box how to find out

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,940
and if you if you can tell me a nice

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,270
girl code or which is capable to return

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:15,110
the most important place around one

00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:17,870
coordinate with in one radius i would be

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:22,130
interested in it's a separate challenge

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:25,670
of gail coding no meter nominating works

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:28,160
very well rather rather okay on this I I

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:31,370
would wish to have also some point of

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:35,840
interest because if there is some some

00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:38,960
news about Mount of motor horn in

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,170
Switzerland I would expect motorhome and

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:46,550
not the city of Zermatt if it happens at

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:50,290
the motor horn so after the examples of

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:54,080
successful correlation between the

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:58,340
between the Twitter bot the trending

00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:02,360
places and there are two sad ones and

00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:05,630
one happy news the third one in this

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:10,430
case is the wildfire and in Canada you

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:14,150
probably remember it is a huge one it's

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:17,630
finally got two times the area of the

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:20,660
country of Luxembourg or one-fifth of

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:24,920
whole Belgium was destroyed by this

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:27,410
wildfire and in fact some days later I

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,770
mean it happened for a third of may

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,950
finally and at the third it has been

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:38,300
beaten and then it still showed up on

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:43,100
the force as for us number three in

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:45,200
these in Indies in this graph in fact I

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:49,670
have to explain the graph because it

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:53,360
shows two different rankings this is the

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:55,540
ranking according to the standard

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,230
deviation and this is the app

00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:04,089
number of views on the logarithmic scale

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:09,100
so please be careful that that we have

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:12,730
here some notice is absolute now in this

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:17,649
case but still it's starting by a very

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:19,149
high number and this turn we changed is

00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:22,660
too low to logarithmic stale after

00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:28,060
afterwards and rector ranking here is

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:31,959
the increasing deviation and then the

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:35,230
second one is the good news the there

00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:38,860
was at the first of June Switzerland

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:41,589
opened the longest railway tunnel of the

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:45,639
world the guitar bass tunnel through the

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:52,680
Alps which connects south with the north

00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:56,259
and then on the north side there was one

00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,250
see one place where festivities have

00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:04,240
taken and this was Frieden then the

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:08,110
third one was the in Italy the air the

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,269
earthquake and then Martin visualize

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:14,250
this and here you see the problem it's

00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:18,880
all over this region of marque and

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:22,959
Aquino but the center tile which showed

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:26,440
up is around here and nominating Richard

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,649
just one of the largest villages in this

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,050
center tile and I mean at least marquee

00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:34,060
is also the name of the region so it's

00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,910
not too bad but it's a problem it's an

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:41,860
issue interesting actually so final

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:45,010
statistics I have analyzed so the boat

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:49,089
takes five hours just filling with the

00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:54,600
sqlite not because of Titan and the

00:12:49,089 --> 00:13:01,180
reporting period of this slide is about

00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:04,210
160 days and 125 there was

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:09,040
as some result and the top 10 countries

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:12,130
have been Russia and then half of the

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,980
occurrences the u.s. places then German

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:18,610
places and so on and the top 10 place

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:24,400
names overall have been Russian places

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:27,820
in front Ukraine a then kazakhstan in

00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,180
fact when I saw this one it could in

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:36,700
fact have been a large from Baikonur but

00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:39,670
that's just some guessing so the final

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,760
open questions of this work is why are

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,580
there so much Russian places is it in my

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,610
algorithm or is it really some unknown

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:53,470
activity nobody could explain up to man

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:55,210
up to me up to now the other question is

00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:59,380
what's the influence of this crawling

00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:03,220
and we still have bias of places with

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:05,410
spikes after zero activity or is there

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,170
other buyers to be expected from this

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:12,250
analysis those are the open questions so

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:18,180
final open questions are do you know sea

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:21,040
cliff or a teens so my hope was that

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:25,000
people would chime in and explain I know

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,510
why athene's shows up and would reply

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,690
but in fact probably because people

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,850
think it's only about and not me they

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,910
are they are not replying that much I

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:39,280
would have expected so still if you have

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:45,250
explanations you can send it to me

00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:47,800
anonymously because it's just fun and I

00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:50,680
no correlation does not prove causation

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:56,250
it's not the proof it's just some

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,250
evidence but is it's kind of cool thank

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:15,680
okay thank you Stefan I'm afraid that

00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,270
due to the technical problem at the

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,030
beginning of the session we can only

00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,670
take one question so we are not reading

00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:36,620
too late compared to the auditorium so

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:38,780
questions take your chance hi would it

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,940
be possible to easily remove all this

00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,070
crawling activity if you have for

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,500
example hashes of IP addresses so you

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,860
can filter out all this because

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:53,060
typically crawlers has just one IP so

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:56,810
you can eliminate it quite easy also to

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:59,480
say I don't have I peace you know yes

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,950
but if you would have not original I

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,140
piece of course but the hashes or

00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,360
something more animals but something to

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,630
identify users that's a question I would

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,150
forward to the admin's because it's but

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:16,520
I can understand the admins really don't

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:19,640
want to have any any means to to trace

00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:24,260
back that you have been making a

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:27,410
holidays in Alaska or in in Greenland or

00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:30,800
something being the only one make making

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:33,110
making holidays or something okay maybe

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,780
edges should happen before during janana

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:38,630
musician already is kind of filtering so

00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,820
this data is not as I discussed this but

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,970
I would it would be nice and of course

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:47,180
Google would do something like this and

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:49,400
it would be very convenient but it's

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:54,010
really a matter of really Animists

00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,010
