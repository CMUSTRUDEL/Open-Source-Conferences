Cycling as a mode of transport for everyday life (besides cycling as a leisure activity) is becoming increasingly popular in many regions of the world. Policymakers as well as travelers acknowledge cycling as an environmentally-friendly, energy-efficient, healthy, and practical mode of transport, which can help addressing various problems of modern cities like air pollution, public health, or congestion.

In contrast to motorized individual and public transport, however, there are few transport models that incorporate cycling, even less such models describing cycling with its characteristic properties. In times of increasing significance of cycling, this is clearly a shortcoming because transport models have proven to be an effective tool to support the planning of transport infrastructures and the analysis of transport schemes. This paper intends to address this shortcoming by including cyclists and their highly-diversified travel behavior into a suitable transport model.

To achieve this, MATSim, an open-source agent-based transport simulation framework, is used. In MATSim, individual travelers are simulated along all their activities and trips over the course of a full day. Due to its microscopic nature, MATSim allows to distinguish between the behavior of heterogeneous agents based on various attributes of the infrastructure and the travelers themselves.

In this study, we discuss and show the use of OpenStreetMap as the main data source to create a transport network that encompasses various properties that are of particular relevance for cyclists. These attributes include roadway smoothness, surface type, highway type, existence of a dedicated cycling infrastructure etc. This information is enriched with other open-source data to account for the roadway gradients in the model.

Based on a growing body of literature on cycling as a mode of transport, rules which describe how those properties are taken into account by cyclists are developed. For validation, our OSM-based cyclists model is applied to an existing transport scenario of the metropolitan region of Berlin, where automated cyclist counts with a high temporal resolution are openly available. As such, simulated cyclist traffic counts can be compared to real-world cyclist counts in 17 locations of the city.

Because of its reliance on OSM as the main data source, the approach is transferable to other spatial contexts.

my name is Dominic simcha I'm at

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,490
research department at tu Berlin where

00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,860
we focus on transport models and

00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,889
transport simulations and today I'm

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,900
going to talk about how we use

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:20,109
OpenStreetMap to model bicycle traffic

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:23,380
in an agent-based simulation so cycling

00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:26,140
is a comparatively cheap fast healthy

00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:29,260
quiet mode of transport that also

00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:32,169
consumes less land for example than

00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,809
other modes of transport and in light of

00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:37,630
the societal environmental and other

00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:41,379
problems associated with motorized

00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:45,100
traffic cities have been starting to

00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:49,000
promote cycling as a yeah as a mode for

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:52,000
everyday transport and increasingly put

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,160
the mode of cycling into travel plans

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,210
for instance the city of Berlin has just

00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,660
last month passed much debated big new

00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:04,470
mobility law that is supposed to foster

00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:08,409
our cycling as a mode for everyday

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,490
transport just like other modes of

00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:13,840
transport also the bicycle needs

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,700
specific infrastructure so we know

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,630
they're trained to work well needs a

00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,729
train track other modes of transport

00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,390
need the infrastructures as well and

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:27,280
also bicycling works much better and

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,799
smoother if you don't have to squeeze in

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,659
with other modes of transport but if you

00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,840
have your dedicated infrastructure but

00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:37,630
we are not all fully sure about this

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,369
we still need and want to evaluate this

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:45,000
and to be able to evaluate transport our

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:48,880
policies and schemes a suitable tool is

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,020
transport planning models they are state

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,159
of the art when it comes to motorised

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,079
individual transport and public

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:02,049
transport but not so much when it comes

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:05,579
to the mode of cycling at our department

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:08,320
we are very strongly involved in

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,720
developing a software that is called

00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,990
Maxim which stands for multi agent

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,750
transport simulation it's an

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:20,200
open source software implemented in Java

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:23,380
so everybody of you you can just go to

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,690
github or to this link here which

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,840
directs you then also to get up and

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:33,580
download or get clone the software run

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,830
it extended um yeah so it's a modular

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:40,960
and as I already implied extendable

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:44,620
software and specifically or specific

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:48,820
formats um is that the study region that

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:51,700
you simulate in it each traveler is

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,850
resolved individually so each real world

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:58,440
traveler is in this software represented

00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:01,750
as what we call agent so it has its

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,770
individual representation and each such

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,390
agent has a daily activity travel

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,180
pattern which we call plan which

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,770
basically says I'm at home or in this

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,450
case yeah I'm at the hotel in the

00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,720
morning then I walk here to the

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:19,090
Polytechnical attend the conference and

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,250
then maybe afterwards I go to a

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,290
restaurant and then I go back to the

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:28,000
hotel so this is my day plan for today

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:30,010
and this is each such a each agent and

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,790
our transport simulation has such a day

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:37,950
which allows us to run quite specific

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:40,530
and disaggregate analyses but still um

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,890
Madsen is designed for large-scale

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,990
scenarios because it's quite simplistic

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,090
in the way it models traffic on the

00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:52,060
network there is no direct

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:55,570
vehicle-to-vehicle interaction it's a

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:58,360
bit simplified every link in the network

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:01,300
is just modeled as a as a cue as a first

00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,170
in first out queue and this makes this

00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:08,920
model suitable for larger scenarios

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:12,780
despite being quite detailed on the in

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:16,540
the way the travelers are represented

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,020
let me quickly explain how you how it

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,910
works

00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,880
it's an iterative approach each

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:26,620
iteration consists of three components

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,910
first as I already said every traveler

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,970
with their individual

00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,850
daily plan is simulated on the network

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:38,020
in doing so they compete with one

00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:40,450
another for limited network resources by

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,710
that they die indirectly interact

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:46,290
because if there are many other

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:50,080
travelers I need more time on my route

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:54,280
when the whole simulation of the day is

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,110
done all agents score their plan if they

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,850
have to spend a lot of time in in

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,090
congestion the score is going to be a

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:04,330
bit lower and if they quite nicely reach

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:07,030
the activity that they wanted to attend

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,790
without any delay they get a they get a

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,830
good score and in the third stage of the

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,920
simulation they are allowed to replan

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,960
you as a modeler can choose by which

00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,700
choice dimension you allow them to

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,940
replan you can allow them to select

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,250
other routes other modes or change their

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:28,570
departure time a little bit and with

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:30,610
their adjusted plan if not in every

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,340
iteration there has to be a just

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,320
adjustment but if you are if you are a

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,710
specific agent that you are looking at

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,720
at an adjusted plan in one iteration

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,550
they go with this adjusted plan into the

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,430
traffic simulation of the next iteration

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:48,490
and then this goes on and on and on and

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,400
at some point it stabilizes plants don't

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,830
change so much and then we try to

00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,140
validate this status against some real

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:59,650
world day data and if we succeed we have

00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:03,840
a base model of our study region that we

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:07,750
can then use for policy analyses and

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,050
this here is a little example how it

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,980
then looks like it's a scenario set up

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:17,290
by my colleague Amit Agarwal and it's

00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:22,990
for the city of Patna in India and you

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:25,180
can here see here bicycles and the

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,790
rectangles are car they actually travel

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,740
on the left side because it's India then

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,650
there are some squares this is trucks

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,840
you can see that they actually pass one

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,500
another this is a comparatively new

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,550
feature that also my colleague our MIT

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,250
implemented and

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:46,699
yeah so here you can see how the traffic

00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:49,250
simulation arm then looks like in

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:52,819
reality and the different colors implies

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,680
if if agents can travel with free flow

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,960
speed more or less then they are green

00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,110
if they are a bit more strongly affected

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:06,889
by congestion they they are depicted

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:10,580
more in in reddish colors as input you

00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:11,810
need the daily our travel plans this is

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,259
a quite complex

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,300
tark task which I will skip here to

00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,639
represent transport demand and on the

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,370
supply side you basically need a network

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,800
you can also enrich this by transit

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,300
schedules if you want to look at public

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,530
transport simulation

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:34,340
additionally but today we can actually

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:37,880
stay quite simple here and only look how

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,680
we create a network and as our main

00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,930
input data source to create such

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:47,240
networks for our transport simulation we

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:49,219
use Open Street Map when creating the

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,580
network we pass through Open Street Map

00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:56,330
for ways and nodes we can optionally

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,520
decide only to go say from from motorway

00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,800
down to tertiary roads or residential

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,610
roads so leave the lower category roads

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,409
out then we create a node if we are at

00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,440
the end of a way or at an intersection

00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:12,349
and then between those nodes we create

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,699
links and in doing so we look at the max

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:19,909
speed tags of Open Street Map or also

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:23,479
look at the one-way tags if it's if it's

00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:26,599
not a one-way we actually create two

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,819
links for our Madsen network because

00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,250
Metin always has to be a directed graph

00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,440
and we also estimate the flow capacity

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:40,399
based on the highway type and the number

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:43,039
of lanes here at this conference we

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,990
actually came with two extensions um the

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,720
one that I'm talking about here for for

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,180
bicycles and another one done by my

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,339
colleague Teresa who is also sitting

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,660
there in the audience and it's she has a

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,750
poster

00:08:53,660 --> 00:09:00,199
which you can look at in building five

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,959
and now as I already said I want to

00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:06,110
focus on the extension for bicycle

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:10,160
traffic and when it comes to bicycle

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:12,589
traffic it's quite important to realize

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,160
that people are quite different think

00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:20,750
they can be young younger or older male

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:25,220
female or have are heterogeneous in

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:29,329
among many other are characteristics but

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,819
when they travel in a car actually a lot

00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:34,550
of this heterogeneity of people does not

00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:37,430
come into play so much a bit

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:40,839
philosophically you could say in terms

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:44,209
of travel behavior a car is some kind of

00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,910
homogenize ER for people because when

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:49,160
they travel in the car they really want

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,800
to minimize travel time maybe if there

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,230
is toll or something there might be some

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,569
properties unreal later to to travel

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,750
time but mostly they want to reduce

00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:02,120
travel time in terms of cycling however

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:05,420
this whole heterogeneity of people

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,209
really comes into play and this is like

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:12,889
the outcome of some literature analysis

00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:15,370
Simona and I did travel time still plays

00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:17,990
role obviously but also route length

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,810
gradients are quite important a car

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,630
driver does not I would argue probably

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:27,860
not not at all care about gradients but

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:30,500
for cyclists steep hill Orem can can be

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,959
can quite affect route choice and travel

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,009
behavior comfort plays a role as a

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:40,490
cyclist you don't want to cycle on

00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:42,980
cobblestones this actually you can go

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,559
further down if you travel with the race

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,860
bike this is even more relevant compared

00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:51,550
to travelling by a mountain bike for

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:54,439
gradients some studies have found that

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:57,800
women actually try to avoid steep hills

00:10:54,439 --> 00:11:01,809
a bit more than men and commuters also

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,689
behave a bit differently as leisure

00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:06,520
cyclists so they are there's a lot of

00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:08,380
yeah

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,660
different things you'd have to take into

00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,640
account here then obviously the bicycle

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,790
infrastructure are there lanes or are

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,740
dedicated tracks intersections the

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,450
volume of motorized traffic this is a

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,280
particular important if there is no

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,640
dedicated cycle infrastructure and

00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:28,630
cyclists have to cycle directly within

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,210
the within other traffic parking

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,870
facilities and some further attributes

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:39,640
also play a role so let me first show

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:43,420
you how we adapted maxim now in when the

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:46,660
plans as I explained before are scored

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,390
at the end of a simulated day in the

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,150
model we now take into account not only

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,790
travel time distance but also

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:57,100
infrastructure comfort and gradient and

00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,470
also other interaction with other

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,310
traffic but today I want to focus on

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:07,420
these three components the scoring

00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:09,760
function yeah basically I already said

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,340
it this is how it looks in its default

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,380
version and now to model bicycles we

00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,110
have added this term this year is about

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,470
the infrastructure about the comfort and

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:24,190
about the gradients and this is the

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:26,470
length of a specific link which we are

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:29,440
scoring in this this moment

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:32,860
so let's now focus what adaptions we

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,310
made here and especially how we inferred

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:41,440
the data that we require for this based

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:46,690
on Open Street Map so if a way is a

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:51,700
highway and has in addition a cycleway

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:56,950
Lane Artech then it's a bicycle a main

00:12:51,700 --> 00:13:01,750
road with a bicycle lane if it has not

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:04,510
the tap doesn't have the lane value for

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,570
the cycleway key but the track value

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:10,180
then it's a bike lane on the sidewalk or

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,590
if it's a bicycle track away from the

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,630
from the road from roads then it's

00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:18,670
specified as highway cycle way they are

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:21,070
further attributes

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:25,260
and I'm not going too much into detail

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:28,900
here but if it's if it's a smaller road

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,170
which we assume to be more pleasant as a

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,270
route for cyclists and I mean I

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,160
shouldn't say assume it's also what we

00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:40,360
found in the literature study that we

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,950
did the cyclists get a bit higher score

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,070
for travelling on this infrastructure

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,020
and if it's a very big road that doesn't

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,910
have any dedicated cycling

00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,050
infrastructure then you get a worse

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,670
score for traveling on it as a cyclist

00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:57,400
regarding the confort there is this

00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:00,520
knife a nice key smoothness on open

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,950
Street which is basically perfectly

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,610
describes what we are looking for it

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:08,620
goes from excellent to impassable the

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:12,210
problem is a bit that this key is not

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:19,870
used so frequently so we see here Berlin

00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:23,620
there are 5700 ways in Berlin that have

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:28,180
the key smoothness I think there are

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:30,460
about 40,000 highways from from water

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,520
weight down to to residential street and

00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:36,760
you also see here that it's a bit

00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:40,140
spatially uneven so it's um yeah it's

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:43,500
not so frequently used so we decided to

00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:49,300
fall back to the key surface which is

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:52,720
used almost everywhere test about the

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,880
same number as there's the highway as as

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,930
there are highways in Berlin so you can

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:03,570
very well base our our scoring for the

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:07,630
comfort component of cycling on on this

00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:10,410
OpenStreetMap key however and this is a

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:15,640
photo that we took yesterday here in

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:17,890
milano the surface on the bicycle array

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,420
can obviously be different from the one

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,480
on the on the road and here it's

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,040
actually better you have here these

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,930
slabs I don't know if this is the right

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,550
word but here you for the cycleway

00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:31,760
you have asphalt so you see that it's

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:36,190
important to take this into a car

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:41,360
and in Berlin there are nine thousand

00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:43,750
ways designated as cycleway taking into

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:51,320
account all the the different

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:53,720
combinations but the key cycle way

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,850
smoothness so which specifically tells

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,360
about the smoothness of the cycle way

00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:04,660
not about the roach in in general is

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:07,970
very rarely used and the our fallback

00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:14,240
surface specifically for cycle waste is

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:18,530
also not not so frequently used then to

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,660
gradient there is this Ella for

00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:23,810
elevation Tec on OpenStreetMap but it's

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:26,860
intended for like four four little four

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:30,710
hills or mountains so it's intended to

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:33,590
specify natural Piaget's and the Ricci

00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:36,230
actually says open street not does not

00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,470
try to be a general data elevation

00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,120
database so it was clear for us that we

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,970
have to use elevation data from

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,790
elsewhere I think I have to speed up a

00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,920
little and this is fine because I didn't

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,560
want to go in too much details here

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,010
there is different types of elevation

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,560
data surface at digital surface models

00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:00,590
and digital terrain models surface

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:04,370
models basically capture everything that

00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:07,400
is there so is if there is a tower you

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:09,800
you will see this y terrain worlds

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,170
basically capture the the bare ground

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,780
what we would be interested in for

00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,480
modeling the slopes of the terrain on

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,820
which our cyclists travel problem is

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,690
this is not so frequently available for

00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:26,660
Berlin we found such data this kind of

00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:29,690
data which is not so suitable is for

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,550
example by SRTM available worldwide but

00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,550
it comes with a downside that it's not

00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:38,300
so well suited and what we then do is in

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:41,270
creating our network we enrich it by

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:44,430
giving it the elevation as a set

00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:47,520
coordinate and this we can then take

00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:54,990
into account when our bicyclists travel

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:58,440
in in scoring yeah this is a little map

00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:01,560
of Berlin in this map that we see here

00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,410
this is the only real point of elevation

00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:08,850
like in terms of terrain if you look at

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:10,830
SRTM you see quite I hope it is it

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:14,970
visibility you can see there's a lot of

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:18,630
noise because it's not so exact and you

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:23,700
really contesting this this peak here if

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:25,170
you go to the terrain model you I hope

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,110
it's more or less visible you can

00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:30,510
actually see this peak here while

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:33,420
there's not so much noise in the rest of

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:38,330
the terrain so this is the data that we

00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:41,580
use to derive information for gradients

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:44,550
other information that we intend to use

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,950
from OpenStreetMap is there are some

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,740
monitoring stations tech actually this

00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:53,610
next to this bridge here in Berlin is a

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:56,790
bicycle counting station and since since

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:59,160
it's sitting directly on the way we can

00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:02,550
nicely integrate this and use it for

00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:05,040
validation in our transport model and

00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:08,040
the data that are like at the actual

00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:11,490
accounts data that are attached to this

00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:14,790
location are also openly available and

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,490
as I said before I mentioned briefly on

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,650
parking may also like the type of

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:25,140
parking facilities along a road may also

00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:28,200
affect how cyclists perceive the route

00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:31,110
and this is in principle also available

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,930
on Open Street Map by this parking key

00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:36,600
but also not not so frequently so to

00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:39,780
wrap up Open Street Map is a super

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,300
useful tool for us we will like it a lot

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,450
and we have been using it a lot and now

00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:49,170
also for this specific task of modeling

00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:52,290
bicycles the text that we could find and

00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:56,640
identify a very good and very suitable

00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:58,730
and yeah specific enough even for very

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,970
high resolution

00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:04,549
bicycle transport modeling some of those

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:09,130
texts are however not so frequently used

00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:13,070
um yeah so I guess this will leave some

00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:17,750
some tagging work for us and hopefully

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:20,570
also for other people and yeah and just

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:23,240
like the data that we use are open also

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,919
as I said our software is open to use so

00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,590
if you want to run it you can go to

00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:30,620
Matson org and under this link actually

00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:34,549
actually also run a small bicycle

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:38,169
simulation example okay that's my talk

00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:38,169
thanks very much

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:48,919
[Applause]

00:20:43,150 --> 00:21:11,840
thank you Dominic no I think there are

00:20:48,919 --> 00:21:14,360
some questions I hope so yes please can

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,700
you can you tell us a bit a little bit

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,710
about what you found out we haven't I

00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,080
have to say we haven't been we haven't

00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,720
yet run the simulation for Berlin so we

00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,820
have a Berlin scenario that's by the way

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,440
also open source so if you if you ever

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,700
want to do your own transport study you

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,380
can just download it and use it and

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,750
there we have the demand like the travel

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,419
plans for a representation of Berlin but

00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,039
we have not applied it yet together with

00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:43,669
a with the cycling world so I

00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:46,070
unfortunately I will have to tell you at

00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:50,710
some later point if we found any

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,710
particularities in our model borderland

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:04,940
since you just mentioned it can you tell

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:09,120
us more about the plants how do you

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:11,850
design them get them do they come from

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,799
surveys or from government data I mean

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:17,429
how do you know that person one goes

00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:20,090
from A to B 7:00 a.m. is there there are

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:22,980
different different methods to do this

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:25,049
there are these household travel surveys

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,299
which you can use and then by some

00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:30,750
sampling procedure a scale it up to the

00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:33,659
full population alternatively you can

00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:37,830
collect demographic and socio-economic

00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:40,380
data and use an external model there are

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,529
these activity-based demand generation

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,409
modules there are several of it and many

00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:48,419
researchers work on it so you can build

00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:50,789
a synthetic population with these

00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:53,070
information and run them in such a model

00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:57,210
and then take the output and feed it

00:22:53,070 --> 00:23:01,770
into Maxim and colleagues of mine have

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:04,110
also been working on yeah big data based

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:06,360
approach is like looking at mobile phone

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:10,250
data or Twitter data so there are

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:14,399
different options and yeah but as you

00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:17,279
noticed Maxim is not itself a demand

00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:20,390
generation model it it it requires an

00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:28,049
initial solution but then can adapt and

00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:32,070
react to policies and yeah yeah another

00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:36,299
question my my two questions would be

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:40,559
first of all are you aware that there

00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:43,679
that you my example is for attack like

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,529
food way that you can have bicycle

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,110
equals yes and that people are either

00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:53,039
taking food wastes and allow bicycles

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:58,380
and other people are taking bicycle ways

00:23:53,039 --> 00:24:01,770
and saying if food way equals yes so you

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:04,559
would catch many percent more data if

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,340
you also allow food way with bicycles

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,919
yes we actually did this I

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:12,100
I think I'm mentioning it but we did

00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:16,120
this so we that footways that ever you

00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:18,309
know that specifically allowed to be

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,289
used by cyclists are are included and

00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:22,539
our cycling network and then the other

00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:24,549
tactic I mean elevation is not that tech

00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:30,880
that much I mean but but still more than

00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:32,470
the very very rare smoothness I never

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,429
heard about smoothness but the height

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:38,830
and you are you are saying you are

00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:43,090
taking into account 10 meters as a hill

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:44,890
in in Berlin so it's you looked for

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,860
about only I'm a Swiss you know ever

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:50,770
because Hill for me it's like he like

00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:52,740
one kilometer or something and so you

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:55,600
are you're looking for smooth

00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:59,500
irregularities so you would need an

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:02,590
better terrain model or something um

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,679
actually we for Berlin we identified

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:08,710
this is maybe I was a bit fast at that

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,860
part we we found a digital digital

00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:16,090
terrain model where we can really

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:18,630
distinguish natural elevations that iraq

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:22,330
that are quite relevant for cycling from

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:24,190
from a tower that only increases the

00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:26,440
height in the surface model right as

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:29,529
which which you have to regard as an

00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,200
artifact because the cyclist does not go

00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:36,090
up and down the tower but around it so

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:39,039
i'm yeah for berlin we have found such a

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:42,100
suitable digital terrain model the

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,200
problem is only that for other locations

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:47,649
and we also kind of want to make our

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,159
approach transferable and not only be

00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:54,730
very specific to a certain location for

00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:56,860
other locations such DTM's digital

00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,200
terrain models are not not openly

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:02,740
available that was a bit the problem and

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,289
regarding the l a-- or elevation tech on

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,470
OpenStreetMap the the wiki really says

00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:10,929
you should only tag like what is it

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:14,049
called natural peak like and like a hill

00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:16,809
or landmark you can if you if you search

00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:19,030
for it you can see that sometimes for a

00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,810
regular street intersection there's also

00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,720
the alert

00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:25,570
but I think this is you know it

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,360
sometimes you find it but if I

00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:30,910
understand it correctly this is not what

00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,710
this la Tech is originally intended for

00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:35,560
so far but I would have suggested is

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,720
that to take leader leader or date which

00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:42,220
is simply too much of information but

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:46,680
you could then try to extract the street

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:49,390
level this is actually leader data yeah

00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:52,600
as I said before I was a bit fast here

00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:56,110
but what we just started using for

00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:00,040
Berlin now is leader day how nice thank

00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:02,230
you oh one last question just a comment

00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,940
and a question so in this presentation

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,650
like in the previous two presentations

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,870
we have seen specific application of

00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,780
requiring very specific OS m data either

00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:13,300
land use in the previous ones this is a

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:16,390
bicycle related data I'm not sure if

00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:20,470
this is a project on Berlin but I think

00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:22,360
Berlin is a very ideal case in this it's

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,910
because everything is really complete in

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,820
terms of bicycle related tax did you

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:30,580
make a survey in other cities in Europe

00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,110
or even outside Europe to see what is

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:37,110
the situation in terms of the presence

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:40,990
of these tags and so we did not do this

00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:42,460
systematically but Simone and I just I

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:47,830
think yesterday or the day before

00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:50,980
yesterday we we did some tech info runs

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:53,080
for Milan and found that it's that it's

00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,810
similar actually to Berlin so you can't

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,620
say it in Berlin there's much much more

00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:01,600
text regarding these these components

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:04,270
that we discussed years old that was

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,770
similar in form we but we didn't check

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:13,350
it systematically for other cities hey

00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:13,350
