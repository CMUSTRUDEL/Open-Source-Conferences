Background and purpose Following the paradigmatic examples of the use of OSM for crisis mapping, there have been sustained efforts to use OSM for mapping preventively vulnerable communities in the global South. This includes, for instance, participatory mapping in the slums of sub-Saharan Africa (Hagen, 2017) and the Missing Maps project. Researchers have also started to study these mapping activities (e.g. Albuquerque et al. 2016; Herfort et al. 2017). However, a collaborative agenda in this area is missing that is able to reflect views and needs of researchers, OSM volunteers, humanitarian organisation practitioners and local communities.

Methodology and Findings After a brief review of existing methods used for mapping disadvantaged communities and slums, we introduce the approach and report on preliminary results from an ongoing large-scale project (NIHR Global Health Unit on Improving Health in Slums), which uses OSM for mapping slums in five cities: Dhaka (Bangladesh), Karachi (Pakistan), Nairobi (Kenya), Ibadan and Lagos (Nigeria). Our methods are based on the combination of satellite imagery digitisation with ground-truthing and participatory mapping. The maps produced will result in enhanced information regarding environmental features of the slums and the location of healthcare facilities, which will also be used as a basis for the health-science surveys of the project. In this manner, our approach is aimed at achieving a threefold goal: (a) participation and inclusion of local stakeholders as a strategy to build resilience; (b) worldwide collaboration, connecting to the global Humanitarian OSM network and student mapping societies; (c) quality evaluation mechanisms for generating high-quality data that can also be used for scientific research.

Final discussion/Impact We would like to discuss the approach and results of our project as a basis to invite OSM researchers, practitioners and volunteers to join us in defining a collaborative agenda towards improving methods and practice for mapping vulnerable communities in OSM. This should include challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective that account for technical, methodological, social and ethical issues. As a result, we would like to contribute to the emergence of an OSM research agenda that goes beyond solely using OSM geographic data for research, but also includes ways of engaging the OSM community and local communities in the research process.

the first author joy is not here with us

00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:08,650
but senses greetings so as an overview

00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:11,499
we're going to introduce you to our

00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,379
ongoing project and then talk about the

00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:16,299
mapping approach we used in the project

00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:18,009
and then after that highlight the

00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:21,720
current state of slum mapping in the

00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:24,400
project and then talk about some issues

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:29,710
which we hope will kick-start the

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,929
discussion so the ongoing project is

00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,080
National Institute for Health Research

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,490
Global Health Research Unit on improving

00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,120
health in slums at University of Warwick

00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:43,690
and the short term goals are to map some

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,670
identified our slums and then capture

00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,610
health services and facilities and and

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,490
also understand how they are used in

00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:54,730
these slums our medium-term goal is to

00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:56,170
identify the costs associated with how

00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,330
the health services are run in these

00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:02,980
lamps and a lot of time goals are to

00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:04,540
build models of health services and try

00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,000
to invest in how they could be improved

00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,720
and also to create a platform of fund

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,970
funded activities and across these goals

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,490
we will involve people who can change

00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:19,210
things in the slums like politicians

00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:21,040
slum residents and also the OSM

00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,610
community who can also help build

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,030
quality baseline knobs and also to print

00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,210
together

00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,300
all is in evidence relevant to slum

00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,840
context so the project is a four year

00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,870
project

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:41,500
ending in 2021 and it costs about 5.7

00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:45,299
million pounds there are five project

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,320
partners - in Asia and two in Africa

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,470
with the lead institution being the

00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,909
University of Warwick in the UK so in

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,729
Africa we working with University of

00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:55,619
Ibadan in Nigeria where three slums are

00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:59,170
being studied

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,820
Shasha a deacon and Barga slums and we

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,880
also working with African population and

00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,369
health our research centre in Parc in

00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,209
Kenya where two slums are being studied

00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:11,769
Korogocho and Verna slums in Asia we

00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:14,260
working with our Khan University in

00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:18,159
Pakistan where two slums are be study

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:21,190
as ambassador land colony and lastly in

00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,830
Bangladesh we working with independent

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,640
University Bangladesh worker Aslam is

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,390
being studied

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,510
so these slums actually vary in the size

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:34,480
of the slums very actually and them the

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,340
biggest slum is in Nigeria Asha and then

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,470
the smallest is in Pakistan nilaam

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:44,019
colony and the project also has five

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,489
work packages web package want deals

00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:47,950
with geospatial mapping of the slums

00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:50,019
that's where we actually based I'm

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,660
working from and where pocket 2 deals

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:55,209
with house or surveys we're parking 3

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,980
deals with evidence synthesis bringing

00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:01,569
all evidence together relevant to slumps

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,340
and work pocket 5 bills Health Services

00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,170
models about health services and try to

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,829
understand how best to improve them and

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:11,379
work pocket 5 deals with stakeholder

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:17,019
engagement and touches on the other work

00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:18,870
packages and so work packet one has four

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,700
main phases the preparation

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,079
psychological image digitization parts

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,880
pretty mapping analysis and

00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,519
visualization we talk more about this

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,019
later

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,209
the outputs of the work package one are

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:33,310
a social spatial data which consists of

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,160
accurate and detailed slum maps at

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,190
building level and also household heads

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,260
listing and this information is going to

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,419
be used to construct a sampling frame

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,340
which in turn is also going to be used

00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:48,519
to sample at least thousand households

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,760
for federal surveys and they are to also

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,130
include healthcare data which consists

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,919
of information about health services and

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,859
facilities and derived accessibility

00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:02,200
metrics and also we would develop a

00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:04,349
methodical framework that will address a

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,950
spontaneous lis special data quality and

00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:11,829
community engagement so we are combining

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,440
methods from geographic data science and

00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,750
social research to tackle a methodical

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,510
challenge so the method is actually

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,820
situated at instruction of spatial data

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,130
quality for example complete nurse and

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,930
Community Engagement such as training

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,200
slum residents involving them in the

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,200
process

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:35,509
our mapping approach starts with some

00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:39,949
preparation activities which involve

00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:42,150
where training materials are prepared

00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:45,270
responsibilities for subsequent stages

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,800
are also defined also a procurement of

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,900
high-resolution optical satellite

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,840
imagery identification of SLAM

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,689
boundaries and also using hot tasking

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,909
manager to develop online mapping

00:04:54,689 --> 00:05:02,729
platforms are also done at this stage

00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:05,159
also slum access permissions are also

00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:07,669
negotiated at this stage and the online

00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:10,379
mapping stage involves using the

00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:12,300
developed online mapping platforms to

00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:15,169
organize our training searches and

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:19,710
mapathon to achieve complete

00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:24,270
digitization of the slum areas here the

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:27,979
mappers are were also to be some of them

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:32,610
we've done this stage so we're actually

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:35,120
authorized to map on the platform the

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,039
online validation stage involves

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,310
correcting errors identified after the

00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,680
online marking stage and the GPS field

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,750
mapping stage actually is where the

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,240
field activities start or the ground

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,849
truthing and so these llamas as

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,919
permissions are actually needed and this

00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:56,189
stage involves using handheld GPS

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:59,300
trackers to track the footpath and then

00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:02,339
the road network with the aim of first

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,909
validating the network and also

00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:08,000
identifying the network and the data

00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:11,879
collected at this stage is used to

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,210
update the awesome database online at

00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:18,599
the GPS digitization stage after this we

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,279
print the food paper maps and take it to

00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:24,210
the field and verify the structure

00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:26,849
geometry and simultaneously also record

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,210
and unique structure codes and some

00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:33,839
field notes using a tablet here we are

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:37,069
using two open-source technologies we

00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:41,199
have open data kit and an open market

00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:44,710
beyond this we scan the few people Maps

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:48,759
and conflict the awesome database online

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:51,370
and we end the field activities with a

00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,139
household health survey and then how

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,090
carefully savvy beyond which we

00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:56,830
construct the sampling frame for web

00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,569
packet 2 to start or the household

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,900
surveys to decide I'll hand it over to

00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:03,430
Vangelis to continue thank you so based

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,990
on our methodological approach or a

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,999
mapping approach we didn't want to

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,860
create data ourselves we want the people

00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:11,110
from those areas to create the data that

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,449
they're going to use afterwards so in

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,360
order to do that we held some mapper

00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:19,509
funds we held six mapper phones in all

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,539
of our sites three in Kenya you can see

00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:27,279
some some pictures here one in Nigeria

00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:29,319
and one in Bangladesh and what we did

00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,089
was we provided technical support to

00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,539
those mapper phones which is more

00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:38,759
difficult than it sounds and we also

00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:42,039
helped in validation for some of those

00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,620
sites but we also had the really good

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,259
help from the hot awesome community in

00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,389
doing those in doing that validation

00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,860
what we did was first train some people

00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:52,930
from those sites because they were not

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,050
familiar with all the same platforms

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,479
train them how to how to produce maps on

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,969
that and afterwards they train the

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,039
community participants in there as you

00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:07,569
can see here in this graph we had some

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,389
in the areas that we had we have here

00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,069
the number of the dark black the number

00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,770
of times and facilitators with trade and

00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,569
the lighter gray is the total number of

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,610
people that were trained those people

00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:20,560
those this number includes people from

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,449
the community people that are slum

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,810
dwellers or people that are just

00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:28,749
volunteered to to map in those in those

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:33,159
areas let's see what we have done with

00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:36,039
that with our approach so that was the

00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,169
state of the two slums in Kenya this is

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,419
v1 down on the left and Karachi on the

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,769
right before we are we entered as you

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,019
can see there is there are not a lot of

00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:45,399
things in there some buildings in

00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:48,320
Korogocho phone with the from a previous

00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:50,090
project but not a lot of information

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,480
and this is the current state this is

00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:57,170
what we've created now in total we have

00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:01,040
added more than thirteen thousand five

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:03,950
hundred buildings and around 2.6

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,380
kilometers of Road this is just for the

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,870
area because the markers were so keen in

00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,030
doing in producing more data than they

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,790
have actually produced much more

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:17,630
information outside of the of the areas

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:19,520
boundaries this is these are our results

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,340
in Bangladesh

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,900
this is quraían Bangladesh which is one

00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:29,150
of the first slums in the world that has

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:31,040
been researched for for such purposes

00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,330
and this was the state before the

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,340
mapping so as you can see there is still

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,730
a lot of there is already a lot of

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:41,030
buildings a lot of roads in here however

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:44,240
this is what we have produced we have

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:46,730
added some buildings here just more than

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,530
17-hundred but a lot of roads in this

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:54,140
case almost twenty kilometers of road

00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,620
this is the case in Kenya we in Nigeria

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,810
sorry

00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,370
which was our Morris for me our most

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,370
interesting example because as you can

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,850
see there is almost nothing in the on

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,090
the slums

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,490
this is barriga this is a CC button with

00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,530
nothing in there before the before

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,030
remapping and with a great help in this

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,220
case we had the help of the university

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,050
that had a Geography Department so they

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,400
have GIS students who knew what they

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,530
were doing from the beginning there were

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,200
more much more easy to adopt and this is

00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:24,320
the current state of it it's quite

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,260
remarkable to be honest almost 10,000

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,620
buildings around 35 kilometers of roads

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:33,370
more than five dirt road but if you see

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,020
those areas now in our SEM around the

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,610
around the boundaries of the slums there

00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,100
are much more buildings that we have

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,900
mapped a lot of more roads and a lot of

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,550
more information ok funding is you can

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,500
see here that were soaking in mapping or

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,120
they have added green spaces about it

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,370
streams reverses everything they were

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:55,560
really really do that passing

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:58,620
okay so you can see we've added a lot of

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,350
special details to the map and for us

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,330
it's important because this spatial data

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,000
will form the evidence base or the

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,830
sample base for a sampling frame which

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,050
is going to be used for the household

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:14,370
service and the hazard service this is

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,720
going to be spatially restricted or

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,060
there has to be a certain minimum

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,620
distance between the households for the

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,110
catchment area of the health healthcare

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:26,460
region so that's why we need this very

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:29,520
detailed spatial data and on the other

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,440
hand we want to make sure that we have a

00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,089
high level of community participation

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,580
because we want to have we want to

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,920
create inclusive data where we have

00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,320
where we know about the local context

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,140
where we know for example what might

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,490
look at the map when you look at them up

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,670
from top down perspective you could say

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,990
maybe there's a corner shop but if we

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,210
have the local information we might know

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,950
that a corner shop also might provide

00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,140
some form of health care we only know

00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:58,350
that if we really engage with the

00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,300
community and by doing that we also

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:04,170
create some or we hope to create some

00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,450
kind of shared learning processes which

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:11,459
we hope would lead to the community

00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:13,700
empowerment as well so we needed to come

00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:18,270
up with some kind of systematic approach

00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:21,420
to to create this both these kind of

00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:24,209
processes effectively and we've done

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,010
that that we with multi-level

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:29,279
collaboration from the local level to

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:31,950
the global level and as Gordon and

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:36,959
Vangelis have mentioned so we've first

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:37,980
train the trainer's locally to to

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,800
organize mapathon

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,580
with the community and with other local

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:48,120
stakeholders which then did and then for

00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:50,070
validation we worked with with our local

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,990
partners so the universities and the

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:56,700
African population has Research Center

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:58,500
for example at the local level they also

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,610
did validation and the wider

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,790
OpenStreetMap community

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,309
and other volunteers and then grant

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,249
ruling will be done by our partners on

00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:12,160
the ground also with with the

00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:17,049
participation of the community this is

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:20,019
just to show here the map Athens on in

00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:24,369
Bangladesh and in in Nigeria with her

00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:26,379
partners and the local community on the

00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:27,549
local level and here at the

00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:31,420
International they're just an example

00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:34,269
our student mapping Society in Warwick

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,429
the Warwick resilience mappers also to

00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:38,019
represent the participation of the wider

00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:42,730
OpenStreetMap community in this project

00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:45,369
which we are very grateful so in the end

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,049
what we what we want this to be we hope

00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:49,839
to create a methodology a systematic

00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:52,209
methodology which is sensitive to the

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,509
contextual characteristics of the of

00:13:52,209 --> 00:14:01,179
this place to space and to create to

00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:03,449
create trusted evidence for for policies

00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:05,769
for urban policies which are

00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:08,169
representative or as representative as

00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:11,350
possible especially in places that were

00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:16,689
previously underrepresented such as

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:19,419
slums so in the research we think

00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,769
actually I mean we have done this

00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:24,989
project and we think there's some kind

00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:28,329
of trade-off in terms of quality because

00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:30,790
so the discussion to be had about what

00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:33,309
are the parameters of quality in

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:36,579
OpenStreetMap so to what extent do we

00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:39,129
want to include local meaning into

00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:41,230
accepted classifications which are the

00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:43,139
tags in OpenStreetMap to what extent is

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,759
that possible

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:50,439
to what extent do we want to have local

00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:52,839
participation or just do we just need to

00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:54,459
limit it to have objective accuracy we

00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,809
just need to know the structures we

00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:57,879
don't need to know exactly what these

00:14:55,809 --> 00:15:00,910
structures are it depends on the

00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:03,189
situation and also the other discussion

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:06,369
that might be interesting to have is do

00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:09,179
we want to know exactly a corner shop is

00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:11,510
also provides some kind of health care

00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,580
although we just want to make sure

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:18,080
or that all structures that we can see

00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:21,650
in the image are digitized so we want to

00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:24,020
put it out to the to the community that

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:28,090
we actually want to trigger discussion

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:30,590
about what are the parameters of quality

00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:34,760
most likely they will be related to the

00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:39,710
project needs and the local context and

00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:43,370
this discussion also relates to to a

00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:47,510
discussion that was recently on in the

00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,080
humanitarian OpenStreetMap team in the

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,880
mailing list

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,050
there was someone who said what's the

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:57,020
what's the obsession of hot to with with

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:59,630
digitizing every little structure well

00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,160
this this kind of questions we could

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,080
answer if we if we think about what

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,910
quality means and in which con in which

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,550
context and what and the project needs

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:11,270
as well so for example in an emergency -

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:13,160
in an emergency situation we just might

00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,450
want to have which was might want to

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,660
know that there is a structure there's a

00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:19,010
building and where the roads are and in

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,860
other projects we might want to have

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:25,100
more local knowledge and also the other

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,830
question is should we include some kind

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,520
of qualitative criteria in the question

00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:33,020
of what is quality should we ask to what

00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,830
extent has the community been involved

00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:38,750
and is the data inclusive enough so

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,610
these are the kind of trade-offs that we

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,850
might want to think about collectively

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:48,830
as a between our researchers and the

00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:51,500
wider osm community and so just to

00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:54,080
finish to thank the OpenStreetMap

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:58,270
community humanitarian OpenStreetMap

00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,420
team and missing maps whose help was

00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,210
incredible

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,590
for the project it would I think it

00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:07,670
wouldn't have been possible without you

00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:09,260
and our partners and funders the

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,690
National the UK National Institute for

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,150
Health Research University of Warwick

00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:17,030
the African population Health Research

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,850
Center the independent University of

Bangladesh Haier Khan University and the

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:26,050
University of even

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:28,930
so we'd like to turn discussion to you

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,580
and to the wider always-on community if

00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:34,030
you have any ideas to talk about this is

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:37,660
kind of issues of quality or anything

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:47,500
else that that came to mind just now so

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:49,330
please get in touch thank you very much

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:56,860
for this very interesting presentation

00:17:49,330 --> 00:18:10,090
other questions okay I kindly ask people

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:13,750
asking questions to stand up hello

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:17,560
thanks for this presentation I mean I'm

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:19,780
impressed I was myself in third world

00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:23,440
countries five six years ago in a

00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:26,200
previous career if I had that data it

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,770
would have changed the way we delivered

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,190
programs definitely had a more of a

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:37,120
human science this question to you what

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:39,490
was the impacts in terms of the way the

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,810
locals perceived their slums after you

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,690
showed them with their Maps

00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:45,610
did it change the way that they perceive

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,640
their slums because there is a weird

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:51,780
phenomenon which is that sometimes there

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:58,380
is an attachment to the misery that

00:18:51,780 --> 00:19:02,020
surrounds them they feel close to it and

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,850
proud even sometimes proud of what they

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:09,520
have been able to build even if it's

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:11,560
just a little so your mapping work has

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,850
it changed the way that they see

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,850
themselves thank you

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:22,580
thank you for the for the question I

00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:25,940
think for now the project actually like

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,860
I said is one year old roughly so I

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,510
would say that for the web package I

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,330
think what your question it probably

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:34,850
might be addressed by web package fie

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:38,330
where as decode engagements gonna be

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:40,730
more intensive so at the moment the maps

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:43,250
we've shown actually it's still ongoing

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,710
so the method that we showed is really

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,170
roughly about the GPS field mapping

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,540
stage so if we really have a lot to go

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:53,000
in terms of completing the map and then

00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,160
we jump into really the details about

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,990
the stakeholders the perceptions and all

00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,640
that and which is also linked to the

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,530
questions were asking about qualities

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,960
what is quality so pissed even we could

00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:05,530
consider that more or less of quality in

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,860
a perceptive quality about you know the

00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:11,510
how the awesome community perceive

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,100
awesome community in terms of policy the

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,910
slum or the communities themselves the

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:19,220
slum committed perceive the maps you

00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:21,500
know and as we have sort of defining

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,470
quality you know so we're not reached

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,630
yet but so in a way I think the question

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:30,680
mind is still hanging probably you come

00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:32,690
back again after after yes yes after a

00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,650
while and then to address that yeah

00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:38,330
thank you very much

00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:39,830
maybe it's it's a really nice question

00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,270
and it was something that were really

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,900
interested in as well but the thing is

00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:47,120
that is very content context based what

00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,560
you're asking so like some of the some

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,150
of the slum residents for instance did

00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,830
not understand that they were actually

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,990
living in slums they thought that they

00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,580
were just living in an air in City area

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:59,150
for instance in Nigeria so there are

00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:01,160
some these types of perceptions that we

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:03,500
want to address on the data as well

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,710
other very context based on digging out

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,660
from what we have seen actually I think

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,490
someone you might have also been in

00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,570
touch with well-known I think map cube

00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,550
area they're going to hold a

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,740
presentation they might know if you talk

00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,150
to Erica Hagen

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,800
she has got a lot of experience in that

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:24,560
so it might also be an interesting

00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,880
question to ask her hi thank you great

00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,549
presentation and

00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,980
thank you again for sharing previously

00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:34,400
more documentation about using field

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,710
papers which is extremely helpful I

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,320
wondered if you'd had any particular

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,580
issues about using field papers and so

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:51,590
on that you could might be able to

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:53,690
mention I think probably if I have to

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:56,960
also acknowledge the presence of cassava

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,330
or the awesome community here Tessa has

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,580
been very active in our project and we

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:04,610
really appreciate what he's done so he's

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:08,570
here so I think it's best to acknowledge

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:10,100
him he's actually also done a bit of

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,860
just to link to the question a bit of

00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:15,140
the field papers on the ground as a way

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,090
of helping us in the project so I don't

00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,270
know if you want to say something about

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:23,960
that but for the so far generally from

00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:26,539
what we have experienced so far both in

00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,150
testan going to each of the slum areas

00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:32,860
to test and with experience with self I

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:36,380
think we've had we've not really had any

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:38,870
any challenge I mean made your challenge

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,909
you know we think that actually is a

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:44,710
good way for of starting especially with

00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:47,900
the slum residents who have actually no

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:50,240
IT skills and the feedback really is a

00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,070
starting point really we it clicks with

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,530
them they see things they can easily

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,049
draw you know what I mean so it's

00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:59,510
something that I think is very important

00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:03,070
in the project like this I don't know if

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,070
Tessa would like to add something to it

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:14,539
I'd rather say that what we have

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:19,100
implemented over there we have a bit of

00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:21,500
blend of open using open map kit and at

00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:25,520
the same time using field pepper papers

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:30,620
as verifying the things or

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:36,380
double-checking the things when in in

00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:38,900
the field we just send to two of the

00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,650
field mappers at a time as a pair so one

00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,950
is

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:48,040
collecting data with om K where other is

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:51,050
drawing on the field papers that

00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,720
certainly validated us afterwards when

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,150
we validated or ground true that the

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,880
things they have done over there

00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:01,760
if if those matches properly or

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,150
something is missing with om K it is

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,360
hard to draw over there building

00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:11,510
structures and stuffs in the dense areas

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,630
like the slum areas with the satellite

00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:16,610
imagery you won't be able to find out

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,740
whether there is one or two buildings at

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:21,080
a time or a cluster of buildings are

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:24,080
there from the satellite imagery it is

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,120
shown that it is either single building

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,470
or there is two building but at the end

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,690
of the day we found out that there is

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:33,860
almost five or six buildings out there

00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:37,310
so when Phil papers are there it helped

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:40,460
out the guys of the field to also draw

00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:43,280
those divisions within the cluster of

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:47,120
the buildings and that helped us to

00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:50,750
identify the house numbers and a IP IDs

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,280
structure IDs we are planning to give

00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:56,720
plan to Eve over there

00:24:52,280 --> 00:25:00,340
so not only the structures were mapped

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,480
the structures were we're given a

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,140
identification numbers so that

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,110
afterwards when the survey will be done

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:12,440
by the work University of afterwards and

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:16,040
other partners there will be easy those

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:26,630
will be easily to detect and trace out

00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:28,490
afterwards we have naming convention

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:30,950
that we've developed about 13 digits

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:34,250
which is based on the Phil paper sheet

00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:39,800
number enumeration area and all that up

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:41,840
to the numbers that are written on the

00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,170
structures so the first time visits to a

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,020
structure we numbers as one and then it

00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,790
follows so it builds up from there to

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:54,300
the

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:57,340
paper sheet number or letter or code yes

00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:59,520
yet maybe I'd like to add the point to

00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,200
that as well because there's another

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,800
issue that we observe others generally

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,570
being observed in the community or with

00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,900
people who actually do some mapping in

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:13,450
the slums so when you look at and some

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,430
of the doors of the individual

00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,230
households you can see that every

00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:19,240
whenever there was a study and every

00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,740
different study had different kinds of

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,350
conventions and you can see all it's

00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:26,860
like because there's there's a list of

00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:28,720
different numbers so there's another

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,300
issue that we would need to talk about

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,260
and generally as being discussed is how

00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,900
can we make sure we're not duplicating

00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:37,060
efforts all the time and yeah that's

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:40,620
basically a key question I think with

00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,620
especially with mapping in stamps

00:26:53,470 --> 00:27:01,700
hey thanks very much for a rice so it's

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,950
it's very nice to see how much when

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,809
we're doing research in those countries

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,900
and now with doing research with

00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:12,799
OpenStreetMap and with building the data

00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:15,650
we need and we also want to build sort

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:19,280
of data for community around the data

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:21,320
and what I think really interesting in

00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,260
in the project that that you're putting

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,540
forward is that you've first add an

00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:28,940
iterations to build the structure I mean

00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:32,750
the rough base layers and then what you

00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:35,720
are describing as as the quality data

00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:38,720
will be the details that you are going

00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:43,100
to add to the map and that's something

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,440
which is not common when you run those

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,250
kind of research project when it's it's

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,890
focused on one Mattox usually there is a

00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:54,140
there are very specific needs for for

00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:57,710
the for the study and then you come with

00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:00,350
with a list of features and and when it

00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:03,500
boils down to resources to get the data

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:08,090
in then it's very difficult to adjust to

00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:10,460
the needs of the the local people living

00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,950
there or and the people working or using

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:17,120
the data so I think it's a it's

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,740
extremely interesting and in in that in

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,900
that that work so that was one comment

00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:24,350
that I wanted to make it out of your a

00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,630
specific project and then this also

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:30,380
triggered the question for me in terms

00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:35,120
of what is really sought from projects

00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:38,000
in terms of intelligence that you want

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,059
to produce over the territory under else

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,520
perspective are you focusing on specific

00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:46,460
else items or is it just something which

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,720
is broked about.oh else facilities are

00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:53,320
being used and managed and so yeah I

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,970
think that this is it for me and the

00:28:53,320 --> 00:29:01,090
second sub questions is what are the

00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:04,299
resources I mean are you managing to in

00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:09,730
very poor areas to have people just

00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:11,889
going mapping and how are you creating

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,720
the mechanisms for on those people to be

00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:15,429
in a position to map and perhaps to

00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,070
continue mapping or are you going to

00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:20,440
accommodate with some stakeholders that

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:23,169
are keen on going on a workshops but

00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,059
they will want to have some rupees per

00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:27,129
diems and all the things which are very

00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:29,830
difficult to handle if you want to build

00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:37,419
sustainability over time so that's the

00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:39,429
one the remark and the data questions so

00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:41,679
prefer for your first question this is

00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:45,070
actually what we're thinking about

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,529
promoting no SME in such project this is

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,250
a this is a project funding but the NHS

00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:53,019
but then I jar which is like health

00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,490
organization so the the whole concept of

00:29:53,019 --> 00:30:00,059
the project is provide better health

00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:02,470
health health to increase to enhance

00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:05,590
health care provision today in those

00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:08,200
areas our approach was for mapping that

00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:10,120
didn't they didn't actually want us to

00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,730
use our same they just wanted the maps

00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:16,720
this was our approach our supervisors

00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:20,519
approach chose to do this to choose the

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,200
same itinerary to go down this way

00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,940
so yeah this is a way of promoting OSF

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,649
in general we were discussing about that

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,750
before about how we can make this

00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:35,620
academic this is actually a project that

00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:38,350
this personification just to add to that

00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:40,840
first thanks a lot for the positive

00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:44,289
remarks and also on the issue of

00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,389
resources we have we working with the

00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:48,879
local partners you know we mentioned

00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:52,410
University of Ibadan at the County

00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:54,160
versity API HRC and

00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:56,200
[Music]

00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,740
impaired and diversity of Bangladesh and

00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:02,290
so we also tapping into the resources of

00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:04,660
the OSM community and one typical

00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:08,170
example is our relationship with our

00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:09,520
cooperation with Tezaab who is the

00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,740
leader of the OSM community in

00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,820
bangladesh and he helped us a lot in

00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:18,700
terms of the logistics and the best way

00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,500
of kind of collecting or doing the

00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,930
mapping and because they've already had

00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,780
the knowledge of the tools that we were

00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:28,660
using and so the training was literally

00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:30,850
reduced from outside so that was very

00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:35,140
useful for us so they had to just go in

00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:37,240
there as fastest train the core local

00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,820
partners project the project team there

00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,130
too for them to understand the best ways

00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:45,600
of doing things we also organized

00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:48,130
through skype several training sessions

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,860
and then beyond that sort of training

00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:53,530
train the trainers kind of thing and to

00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,670
allow them to also especially the mapper

00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,830
tones and the training sessions

00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:58,840
we were able to then organize your own

00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:02,710
map patterns and organize themselves

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,710
vocally to to map and beyond that nunna

00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:08,230
suggest mapper tones delay also the the

00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:11,530
core team were also doing the mapping

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:13,420
afterwards or in-between yeah so I'm I

00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,520
think in that sense does it

00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:19,180
and we also bought handheld GPS devices

00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:21,970
especially for the GPS tracking and

00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:24,100
others we it's not that much but we were

00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,530
able to at least I think for each slum

00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,630
we we bought just one gamming handheld

00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:32,340
GPS and we were able to use that to

00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:34,990
identify the network or validate the

00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,990
what has already been mapped and things

00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:39,250
like that ok sorry I have to stop the

00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,130
discussion here because we are already

00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:44,290
out of time again will provide the per

00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:50,290
diems as well we're providing per diems

00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:52,150
as well for the ok just one announcement

00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:54,280

break before especially if you have a

00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,360
lightning talk because you know

00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,890
lightning talks are very short so we

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,420
need everything already on the computer

00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,160
or show up if you're using your own
