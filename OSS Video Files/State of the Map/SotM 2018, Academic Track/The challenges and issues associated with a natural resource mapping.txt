The resource mapping framework (RADIMA) is a tool for sub-national, county-level climate adaptation planning targeting the most vulnerable communities in developing countries, whose livelihoods may be reliant upon the effective management of natural resources. It allows the integration of community adaptive practice and climate change information into planning decisions at the local level by enabling natural resource information to be captured by local communities using a more detailed attribution model than that available in OpenStreetMap. The granularity of data offered by the RADIMA application is also of value to the broader academic community. In particular, for research that focuses on adaptation and resilience of communities and the effects of climate change upon the natural resources from which these communities depend. The importance of local knowledge in such a data capturing exercise cannot be underestimated, as land rights and planning decisions may stem directly from the data as represented in the system. In particular, the mapping of features based on topographic representation alone may not align with ownerships and rights information which may be essential to the resource management and to support advocacy. For example, the mis-representation of water sources in arid and semi-arid environments could have a profound effect upon any future climate change mitigation strategies. A significant challenge is to determine what level of crowd-sourcing and control is appropriate for the RADIMA application, as local people would not necessarily want their data to be edited by somebody who does not possess knowledge of the local area and rights-based information (i.e. who is perhaps on the other side of the world). The depth of classification of land cover types is another example that presents its own set of challenges, such as the local and regional variability of pasture types, and their correct representation on the RADIMA map layer. By contrast, the question of accuracy and completeness arises as with any open-mapping framework. In the context of gaps in the data, do the gaps represent features that are missing from the map or do they genuinely represent the fact that no natural resource features exist at that location? The challenges described above are discussed with examples across sub-Saharan Africa, together with the initiatives that are being taken to overcome them. Further information: http://bit.ly/2t7fTg0

great thank you very much good afternoon

00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,549
everyone thank you to Marco and the rest

00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:13,280
of the state of the map team for

00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:15,469
inviting me unfortunately I was caught

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,370
up in the travel chaos at London Gatwick

00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:21,740
on Friday but nevertheless despite that

00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:25,970
I'm despite not being there in person

00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,670
I'm very excited to present our work to

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,230
you and so hopefully you can all see

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:36,320
this please do signal if there's any

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:39,200
issues in connectivity okay so I'm going

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,540
to present you the redeemer project this

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,489
is the name given to the natural

00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,430
resource mapping project at the

00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:48,950
University of Southampton it's run by

00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:52,070
the geodata Institute at the University

00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,970
of Southampton and has been developed in

00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,230
close collaboration with the

00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,950
International Institute for Environment

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:04,940
and development led through project

00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:08,360
activities with different UK aids and

00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:13,570
ICN funding supports in Tanzania Kenya

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:17,960
Mali and Senegal the project starts in

00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:20,290
2013 and is an open mapping framework to

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,420
support sustainable development action

00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:26,090
it is targeted at community-based

00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:29,810
participatory mapping of Natural

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:31,640
Resources and I have actually been

00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,570
instrumental in the growth of the

00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,799
project to date by recognizing that a

00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,799
platform that can map the often

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,590
invisible nature if you like of Natural

00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,100
Resources this aligns very closely with

00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,970
the devolved County planning processes

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,700
and I'm going to go on to talk about

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,470
this in the next couple of slides and I

00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,950
personally have been involved with the

00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:57,950
projects for about 12 months now and

00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,430
I've recently returned from helping to

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:03,860
run a training exercise in Kenya and an

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,200
extension to the brace program which is

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:10,130
building resilience and adaptation to

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,050
climate extremes disasters and here we

00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,110
have been training local government

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:18,680
staff to become trainers themselves

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,500
and to convey the mapping process to the

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,420
pastoral communities themselves so my

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,790
presentation is going to focus primarily

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,790
on Kenya purely because this is a

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,260
current area of focus for the project

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:35,960
but is very relevant in terms of

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:38,270
decision-making in policy so aims of the

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,790
project from the broad level and are to

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:45,500
develop an open school for sub-national

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:49,210
level adaptation plan and it's

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,630
specifically its vulnerable communities

00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:55,220
who are often marginalized and and

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:59,570
misrepresented and it's really about

00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:04,130
integrating the adaptive practices into

00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:06,440
planning for the tool itself it's about

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,110
capturing the knowledge from communities

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:13,550
whose livelihoods depend on naturalism

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,920
and really depicting the spatial and

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,160
temporal variation in pastoral mobility

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,540
which understandably is as fluid as it

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,760
gets and obviously in the context of

00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:32,900
climate change to be flexible enough to

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:38,120
evolve and adapt the changing climate so

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:41,870
what are these the kind of well for

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,350
Kenya specifically and that two things

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:49,130
the integrated development plan

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:51,680
syidp and the county spatial plan CSP

00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,810
and the extendable model of

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:59,360
OpenStreetMap is really is a really good

00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:02,500
fit for our project and these two plans

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,230
if like are very advanced for

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:11,570
sub-saharan Africa anywhere really

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:14,570
because they specifically States GIS and

00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:24,130
spatial spatial database if you like

00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:24,130
must be any and an inherent part and the

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,199
plan must provide a space

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,440
depiction of the social and economic

00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,930
development program of county and these

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,210
these really as I said this is

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,310
recognition by the government spatial

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,750
characteristics matters losses are

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,060
fundamental to campus future vision and

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,250
so for instance in the case of

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,930
marginalized rural communities things

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,539
like land ownership and rights

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,909
information or not historically not

00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:59,030
ported and therefore that registration

00:04:55,909 --> 00:05:01,580
is not is far from a formal process it's

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,870
anything but that so whilst if the

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,240
government know that these problems

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,419
exist they don't know where they exist

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,610
and they can't remediate the problems

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:14,270
because they can't they don't know where

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,699
to work so then an ultimate goal of what

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,199
we're doing is to try and formalize the

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,630
way in which all of this hidden

00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,800
knowledge can captured and help them you

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,800
to help drive honest

00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:33,740
so areas covered so far so since 2013

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,690
the project hasn't been actually hasn't

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,729
actually been funded directly but it's

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,250
been built up as theories of individual

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:43,340
research projects and it's grown into

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,919
like a natural resource platform and the

00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:49,219
focus is the arid and semi-arid land

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,740
areas case out and for instance because

00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:53,960
of the outputs of these projects instead

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,120
of three or four separate map web

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,680
mapping and portals it makes sense to

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,419
bring them all to a single database

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,960
system so Senegal Mali Andean Tanzania

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:08,479
have been these focal areas so look at

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,400
Kenya to show how standard we've

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:15,020
extended the standard OpenStreetMap

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,120
model and this is what it looks like

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,360
this is a picture from last week the

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,240
current community mapping exercise which

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,919
air can see northern Kenya and the

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,550
people standing at the front the

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:35,180
officials were trained by me a month ago

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:37,149
of Nairobi and this is what it starts

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:41,420
this is how it starts this is about

00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:44,800
paper maps and starting to understand

00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:48,980
the cognitive picture if you like

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,960
Astralis community the the areas on the

00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,770
land on the grounds that are important

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:59,240
to them and what needs to what is

00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:03,440
important for their livelihoods so we

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:09,050
use awesome java street map editor and

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:13,370
we then using offline satellite we then

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:17,270
go in and draw and tag data in the

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:19,910
normal way and we've developed a custom

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,250
preset tagging structure for using

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:26,540
Joseph and obviously the offline

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:38,660
capabilities of Jocelyn are important

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:41,240
when you can you must you can so what's

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:45,130
the end of a workshop data uploaded

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,130
through server infrastructure which is

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:57,220
illustrated so how we actually ending

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,220
the OpenStreetMap datum oh well

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:09,410
so ok I'm showing here Brook past an

00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,270
area in the Sierra camp in Kenya and

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,940
they're sort of broad pasture areas and

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,520
depicted by different change between

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:19,460
depending on their attributes Rivers has

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:25,490
shown both permanent rivers and also

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:30,730
seasonal ones so ephemeral rivers only

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:33,380
flow for certain parts but as we see

00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:36,500
additional contextual information is

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,690
shown like competing wildlife migration

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,540
which they're almost like the elephant's

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,370
corridor on the left here that's they're

00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,750
obviously competing for the same water

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:49,310
sources and the there is a drought

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,580
refuge in here I don't know if it's

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:55,190
visible in the brown and polygon area

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:59,270
and ambition it

00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:01,970
swamp chatter in Swahili and these areas

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:05,150
obviously overlap and that wouldn't

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,850
normally immediately yes - you know

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:14,180
somebody mapping this area out the boat

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:15,530
knowledge and feet from here is more

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,410
difficult as point

00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:26,690
so water pans would thanks bad for hopes

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:30,500
only wells that type of thing and if we

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:34,580
look at and one specific water point

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,470
here well this one of the key things

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,670
that we need to capture for posture list

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,820
is what does a good water point actually

00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:47,330
being well one thing from a human

00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,550
consumption perspective because there

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,650
was a drinkable water but something

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:56,080
completely different than pasta BISM

00:09:51,650 --> 00:10:01,000
because quality of its perhaps not so

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:08,410
pastoralists but the reliability is

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:11,330
because simply translate and

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:14,060
consequently there's a maximum radius

00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:20,720
way from the that must be considered

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:23,920
you're going to minimize this there are

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,020
huge variations in water pump design

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:31,040
manufacture availability of spare parts

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:33,530
is really as a varying picture across in

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,660
rural Africa and this makes remedial

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,390
action really difficult and because if

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:42,110
you don't know that specific type of it

00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:45,920
if it's broken it very difficult to fix

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:49,150
and but as we sort of capture this

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:54,920
bearing reliability and on the Left the

00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:57,140
reliability drives and we can start to

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,620
say you know we can highlight these as

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,390
should be addressed and really many of

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,820
them are clusters good the ones that

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,780
we've mapped they are clustered but the

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:10,780
key thing is reliability and I

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:13,810
and you know and as this framework we

00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:16,600
chose with the reliability over many

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:21,940
years and captured and analysts you

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:25,150
change that and looking at more

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:28,060
granularity and grass types of open

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,050
captured many hidden attributes and here

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,760
are some of the less obvious

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:36,970
um pasture designation so dry season

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,900
grazed versus around the pasture salt

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:44,320
sauce grassland site herbaceous first

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:47,740
shrub east planet this type of thing

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,550
leave type cycle the cycle is

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:54,040
written grass types that are beneficent

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,470
to sheep they thrive understand install

00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,840
Commission's but the nutritional value

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:02,020
of a particular grass varies immensely

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,360
during its growth cycle so variation

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,670
which has made really much more complex

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,180
if you have sure if the grass is

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:12,490
subjected to weather patterns and so

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:16,630
certain grass might can be damaging to

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:19,450
the health early stages growth cycle so

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:24,270
if that growth cycle is consistent year

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:26,920
upon year is soon a recipe for problem

00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,930
and this is because at the early stages

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,750
of the growth cycle the plants natural

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:36,940
different mechanism for most in most

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:38,860
abundance and conditions of access as

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,920
we've seen ownership and rights

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,530
information are key and especially where

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,830
this is linked to the sustainability of

00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:50,770
the prosper slightly and so where the

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:53,620
role of flexible livelihoods and was

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:57,580
also very but it really is seen as an

00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:00,130
advantage and with us as it is with

00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:04,750
water availability local negotiation

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:08,560
takes place here is so reciprocity and

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:11,620
that's captured as an attribute and but

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,850
this ownership rights does raise the

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:19,540
question if you know and how how open

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,220
the question openness of the data it

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,000
should ownership an actor since they

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:29,920
be available online for free maybe there

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,050
are levels of accessibility protected

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:37,720
areas obviously understandable that

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,939
conflict conflict issues can arise the

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,290
availability of sources as one might

00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:48,699
imagine access to water areas designated

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:50,740
as pasture and the sort of affiliation

00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:53,579
and the first boundaries in pasture land

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:56,790
leads to this situation of conflict and

00:13:53,579 --> 00:14:00,160
this is something that we capture

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:05,759
sometimes it's unknown but it's even if

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,759
it is unknown it is investigation

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:18,939
so um challenges that were looking at

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:21,730
who can ensure is it the side of the

00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:24,100
problems and it's pasture area when they

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:28,779
have no real knowledge of the

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,839
nutritional variant for us it's it's big

00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:35,410
question and how open is the dates that

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:39,600
can apply others for analysis yes it

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:41,949
can't adaptation madness

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,459
how can we catch it using the mapping

00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:48,939
framework well especially processing is

00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:55,389
an attribute living and and that's a way

00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:58,809
that but it's also closely linked

00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:02,860
frequency of updates so if you're if you

00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:04,839
have a very frequently updated map with

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:08,160
features who starting to see changes in

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:11,889
the guns in terms of what they represent

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,540
change travel if you care is this type

00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:20,740
of thing that this can be understood

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:23,920
through time series analysis gaps in the

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,079
data and do the gaps a day to day

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,509
present features that are missing from

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,540
the map or are they genuinely known

00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:34,230
features at that location and that's a

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,230
really difficult

00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:40,960
really one really it's something that

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:45,460
the maturity of the platform community

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:49,090
engagement really addressed and but sort

00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:50,830
of the final one is is engaging the

00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,650
local communities throwing the mapping

00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:59,650
process and this really kind of links

00:15:53,650 --> 00:16:01,060
together the three points above and so

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,190
the process that we've been going

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,870
through training the trainer's if you

00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,690
like sand we've been training the the

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:11,050
government staff to then go out and

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:15,250
train the pastoral communities it has to

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:19,750
be done in the local local language with

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:23,070
a local custom the local way things are

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:26,920
carried out this is the first step and

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:30,930
this kind of engagement can take quite a

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:40,180
few attempts before you end up with an

00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:46,300
accepted you can see in Kenya in terms

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:49,050
of kind of in Africa it's very much a

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:52,030
patchwork quilt and this is really

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:55,180
understandable and it's really no

00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:58,000
different to the variation in the

00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:01,480
progress that UK local authorities have

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,820
and with tasks mapping tests that are

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,560
much more similar simpler more

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,560
straightforward than Natural Resources

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:15,160
so summarize and bring it together

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:18,360
there's definitely a growing need to

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:23,790
capture the less visible attributes

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:28,780
across the exit that's without question

00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:32,100
and importantly at a very high level it

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:39,360
is recognized the value of accurate data

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:43,380
exists this is really a future and

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:47,430
challenges exist as well but like

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:50,760
crowdsourcing projects document

00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:53,520
and neutral pastoralists get mapping has

00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,400
really never been greater so to the

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,560
bringing all of the above together

00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,770
challenge is kind of balancing the depth

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:05,070
laniel arity you need to go to and also

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:07,410
the temporal resolution theta versus the

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:10,050
effectiveness top-down decision making

00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,720
and the as we've seen with this

00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,520
yellowing Aniyah the solution is

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,670
developed Authority for management

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,700
decision-making at the high level it you

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:24,810
know information or the key granularity

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:27,060
data to get lost and we are as effective

00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:31,350
looking government officials in which

00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:33,240
year now to achieve the same goal and

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,010
not that note thank you for listening

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:41,840
I'm certainly happy to answer any

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:41,840
question thank you

00:18:45,560 --> 00:19:06,470
yes I can't yeah I can't you see o

00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:09,080
recording my question would be I noted

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:12,460
that you have used the tag reliability

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:16,360
try reason which I have known before and

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:22,040
my experience my question always is is

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:26,780
are hot people and people from the raw

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:31,400
material nations I assume they are you

00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:34,730
are using in the usual tags and else it

00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,280
should be justified to use a non usual

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:40,280
tag it is a usual tacit the one I

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,250
mentioned I have reliability dry season

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,530
is an example of the one one of the ones

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,500
that we've extended I don't think exists

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,270
it exists in the normal I could be wrong

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,740
but I don't think it's in the normal

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:56,420
frame work I think that's one that we've

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,920
added in yeah I'm not entirely sure but

00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,350
I think it's one that we do that it I

00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,320
mean it's ok because I obviously think

00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:06,850
elusive but is it documented so I'm here

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:10,460
and somewhere as a tag and what it yes

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:13,910
yes it is absolutely so we we developed

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:16,210
a parallel wiki and with explaining all

00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,520
of the tagging structure alongside

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:21,880
alongside the project as well so it is

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,700
all available and certainly happen to

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:30,730
divulge any of that to anyone that wants

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,730
