For well over a decade now there has been substantial interest on OpenStreetMap (OSM) from the academic research community. The incredible success of OSM is an intriguing source of potential research for academics. Based on our collective observations as academics, OSM contributors, and users of OSM data, there is much room for improvement in the interactions between the academic research and OSM communities. There are two sides to this story. One one side the OSM community often learns only very late (or sometimes never) about research results generated from academic research on OSM itself. On the other side the academic research community has often little information, or understanding, on what the most important research and scientific concerns for the OSM community actually are. Subsequently, a large amount of academic research is carried out on OSM in complete isolation from the OSM community itself. How can we work towards creating better connections and collaborations between the scientific/academic research communities and the OSM community?

In our SOTM conference presentation we shall look to propose a starting point for meetings, discussions and collaborations between the academic/scientific community and the OSM community. A first step in this direction has been the establishment of the OSM Science mailing list [1] in January 2018. The Science mailing list has many functions including: encouraging academics to look for feedback and support on your planned OSM surveys (BEFORE they are undertaken), providing a means for OSM contributors to pitch or propose problems and challenges, based on OSM, to the academic community (and vice-versa), talk and critically evaluate recent scientific research on OSM, etc. However, bigger steps lie ahead. In our presentation we shall concentrate on two key issues: (1) How to improve communication structurally and in a sustainable way between both the OSM community and the academic research community; (2) How we can move forward and enable co-created research?

One potential target outcome from SOTM 2018 would be agreement to work towards establishment of a more structured global survey that proposes research ideas based on suggestions generated by the OSM community and academics/researchers

it's our pleasure actually to be the

00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:09,730
first-ever presentation at an academic

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,370
track I don't see em and we are going to

00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,490
present this jointly so I hopefully

00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,930
without practice this is going to go

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,449
smoothly

00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,160
hey we decided to show you a scientific

00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:24,070
slide with some symbols in it first

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,920
because we're going to talk about a two

00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:30,070
sided story here we're looking at

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,990
translating the needs of scientists for

00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,120
OpenStreetMap and then the other side of

00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,879
the story which is translating the needs

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,710
of OS m into a language that's

00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:40,780
understandable by scientists and then we

00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,870
want to see where these two things

00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,459
actually overlap the overlap is what

00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,019
we're very interested in is where the

00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:49,170
two communities can begin working

00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:52,179
together but that would require

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,039
scientists welcoming OSM and osm

00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:55,749
welcoming scientists and vice versa and

00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,059
actually how can that happen so at the

00:00:55,749 --> 00:01:00,069
end of the presentation we hope to have

00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:04,210
some discussion with you on how we can

00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:05,950
move forward in that respect just to

00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,140
give you a timeline of this idea this is

00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,850
a non-traditional academic talk and we

00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,939
don't have a set of experiments here and

00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:15,280
analysis and some conclusions and we

00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,890
were talking and hand waving a little

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,149
bit back last April there was a an

00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,100
excellent workshop that I had

00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:23,409
co-organized in in Leuven in Belgium

00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,289
which brought together national mapping

00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:29,560
agencies volunteer geographic

00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:31,929
information project like OSM academics

00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,640
and industry together to talk about how

00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:35,829
crowdsourcing could be used in national

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,710
mapping and during the breakout sessions

00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:41,049
used Frank and a few others we began to

00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,789
talk about how we could bring osm and

00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,340
the academic community together in a

00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:48,069
tangible way so we had some Skype calls

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:51,880
during our holidays last summer we then

00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:56,200
created an osm science mailing list we

00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,090
produced a blog post and then we went

00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,369
into hibernation for the winter time and

00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,530
then we decided that the best way to

00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:04,840
kick this off would be to take the

00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,119
opportunity to submit to a state of the

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:14,050
map and here we are at the academic

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:17,660
track so at

00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:21,860
this slide summarizes really what we

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,510
believe is our our goal here today that

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,940
on our collective observations as

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,670
academics as always same contributors

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,260
and then users of always same data

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,700
because we all are users of the data

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,300
there's much room for improvement

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,520
between the academics involved in osm

00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,930
research and the OSF community and

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,930
there's actually two sides to this story

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:48,560
so that's really close is that good yeah

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,209
I had learned yesterday that I should

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,010
put this too much because otherwise how

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:55,970
I do this you don't

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,709
and here anything anyway so from the

00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,980
OpenStreetMap site you could say that

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,110
one of the problems is that we don't

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:07,220
always hear about all the research or

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:12,860
when we do it's uh it's in passing and

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:15,590
it's very hard to understand so there is

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,269
definitely a chance to improve the way

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:24,010
it's communicated towards the community

00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:26,239
and on the other hand of course the

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,060
academics when they start doing their

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,190
research the the timing of involvement

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:37,130
with the the wider OpenStreetMap

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:39,650
community isn't always optimal like well

00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,110
it starts at the beginning what are we

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,810
going to research there's a lot of open

00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,430
questions that the community has and

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,860
that's not always the things being

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,459
researched and probably that's because

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:58,660
we don't formulate the questions clearly

00:03:51,459 --> 00:04:01,160
consider a chaotic bunch so yeah

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,049
basically that's our core question how

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,500
can we how can we improve this how can

00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:10,850
we work together so that there's a

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:14,180
constant link between us and that

00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:18,280
research would be more interesting this

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,239
is still working yeah okay thanks so

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,490
that's a research would be more

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,030
interesting both for community and

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:28,190
scientists

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,990
so the the the in our equation that we

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,850
posed a few minutes ago the first thing

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,620
is looking at scientific needs and

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:38,990
trying to communicate them in a

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:43,070
understandable way to the OSM community

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:45,520
and I suppose looking out I can spot

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,620
lots of academic colleagues by

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,050
familiarity or just by seeing your other

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,780
conferences and what does academics tend

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,070
to do is there is an increasing

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,730
scientific interest in osm and that's

00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:01,640
very easy to to to show through looking

00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:04,490
at the number of papers the number of

00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,900
workshop workshops and conferences that

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,840
have been organized with osm as a

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,250
central part of the discussions now

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,850
scientists need to publish their work

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,440
that's how we get paid that's how we get

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,920
our next grant that's how we get our

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,380
next promotion hopefully and scientists

00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,430
are very interested in in vgi including

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:28,340
osm and what can happen sometimes is

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:32,080
that the academic can formulate the

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:34,550
research problems about vgi and osm

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,220
around their perception of what the gaps

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,980
are rather than actual on-the-ground

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,320
understanding of what those gaps are so

00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:46,220
the scientific perception may not always

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,220
be useful for the simple fact that the

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,220
OSM community is a global community and

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,510
it is not easy to understand it's not

00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,070
easy to build the communities are easy

00:05:53,510 --> 00:06:00,740
to to maintain a community so it's a

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,330
problem in that academics can be

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,560
detached from the community without

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,940
really understanding how it works

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,760
there's also the issue of translating

00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:14,510
those results from scientific research

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,130
to OSM so people in the OSM community

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,200
are often very technically minded

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,930
they're often scientifically minded but

00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,240
they may not just be familiar with a lot

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,890
of the jargon and terminology used by

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,960
scientists sometimes so scientific

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,050
papers tend to have a format and a

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,730
template that involves a lot of jargon

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,370
scientific output most importantly tends

00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,800
to be inaccessible it tends to be behind

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,050
paywalls it tends to be in hidden places

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,720
on the Internet

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:44,699
the dark academic web where people who

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,259
are not academics kind of find it and

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,210
sometimes the scientific merit is

00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:51,639
difficult to judge so a paper may look

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,319
very good on the outside it might have

00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,819
lots of equations it might have machine

00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,099
learning it might have been data in

00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:59,530
there but the actual value of it

00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:03,370
- OS m or the vgi community may be

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:04,720
difficult to understand and it can very

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,129
often be the case that it can be

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,819
difficult to distinguish between two

00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:11,470
scientific papers doing the same job so

00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:13,750
something that we're interested in in

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,940
tackling and it was Frank that suggested

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,430
this is that the academic community

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,550
should be proposing an idea of a

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:24,490
translation where we can start to make

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,900
it more accessible to people to

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,539
understand the results that we're

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,690
producing so to start producing academic

00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:34,000
mumbo-jumbo or mumbo-jumbo and producing

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,560
actual information and knowledge for

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,300
people to use in the in the community

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:43,240
and the hottest state of the map that I

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,860
was in was in Girona in 2011 when it was

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,419
40 degrees I think so

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:53,050
it makes today sound tempers machi

00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:57,400
Hackley suggested a seven Rule step for

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:59,529
academics working with OS m and as our

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,259
parents would say it's as true today as

00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:04,120
it was then academics should try to do

00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:06,969
some mapping so I do do some mapping

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,430
they should try to read the content

00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:12,520
produced by the community explore data

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,979
so be a user of the data try to put your

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,440
outputs in in open access so that people

00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:20,349
not just OS m people that anyone can

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,380
access them then publish and share data

00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:25,719
that you've processed so that's this

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,940
looks at reproducible science and be a

00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:31,599
critical friend to our Sam so it's it's

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,370
ok to say I think you could improve X or

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,010
I think you could improve Y but

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,829
demonstrate rationale behind it and then

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:42,190
teach I teach in the university and

00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:45,940
every course I try to get osm web

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:48,040
mapping and OS geo type things into

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,949
those courses so it's important to try

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,910
and bring along the next generation of

00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:55,630
of

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,790
purrs and geo enthusiasts so now we look

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:02,200
at the white party which is translating

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:05,920
osm needs into science so one of the

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,570
things we did was try to get a feeling

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,580
for the IDS that live within the

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,180
community because there's there are some

00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,770
wiki pages with those IDs but they're

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,540
not really maintained and not many

00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,120
people edit it and when you ask

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,460
questions on our mailing lists you tend

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,780
to get more answers than you want so

00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:27,040
that was in this case

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:32,710
that was what we wanted so we got a very

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,900
diverse response when we explicitly

00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,720
asked about what we should be doing and

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,300
what the research community should be

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,780
doing we picked some interesting

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,030
examples from that for me the the

00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:49,690
research wiki page is among the most

00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:54,630
important we should really I don't know

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:58,860
just start working on it to make it more

00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:03,370
a landing page let's say for scientists

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,050
as well as that all the research that's

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:09,690
listed there is maybe not the best way

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,690
to present results to the community I

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:18,970
see so yeah there's very interesting IDs

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,470
I guess you get a link of the

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,830
presentation afterwards if you want to

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:27,100
look at them in detail I think the last

00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:31,060
one here is also important it's more

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,890
like a frustration I guess from some

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,960
people within the community that some

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,900
research with a purse which they

00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,150
perceive as poor quality or headlines

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,250
derived from them keep coming back and

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:47,230
you have to keep explaining like nay

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:50,050
that's really not the best analysis so

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:53,680
it would be helpful if it's it's that

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:56,170
kind of thing is better documented so

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,820
right now the wasn't wicked looks like

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,250
that I think for me that's one of the

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,510
main projects to handle together to see

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,510
where we should go with

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,889
so I suppose that's this is the academic

00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:11,929
equivalent of the research wiki page

00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:13,699
something like the science direct search

00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:16,160
which you may or may not have heard of

00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:20,420
so this is very easy for myself to log

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,059
in via my work log in and you can access

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,809
pretty much any publication ever created

00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,699
on OSM

00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,410
to show the popularity there's there's

00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:30,559
five hundred results there for just an

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,850
osm search in in the last two years so

00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,230
this is welcoming for academics

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,230
academics feel at home and very

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:38,569
comfortable around these pages but a

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,459
citizen or anyone looking at this

00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:43,819
outside of an institutional logon or

00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:45,379
paying large fees cannot access many of

00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:49,009
these now some of them are open access

00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:51,319
but but many of them are not so where

00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:53,660
does the overlap the intersection lie

00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:55,999
and that's the question that we're

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,779
ending the presentation with today is is

00:11:55,999 --> 00:12:01,429
looking at where can we find a suitable

00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:04,489
middle ground here for the two

00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:08,990
communities to begin working together so

00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:11,869
the proposal we have is well we think we

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,929
might need to extend our the way we ask

00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:17,480
the question so move forward based on

00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:22,069
the IDS we already generated and see if

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:25,879
we can find a way to survey the wider

00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:31,040
community to get more structured input

00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:33,619
to our to find methods to use structure

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:40,939
to community input to find our

00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:43,369
priorities another tool that we already

00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:47,839
started with so we have the wiki of

00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:50,269
course which is a main project two other

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,600
ones is that we started the science

00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:55,549
mailing list so within the mailing list

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,919
system of the OpenStreetMap community

00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:59,629
which is still it's very old school but

00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,169
it's still one of the main channels

00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:06,169
especially for the global community so

00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:08,779
there is a group of people there already

00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:10,910
who are interested in the subject there

00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:14,389
hasn't been much activity but I think if

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:16,730
there's a real question from scientists

00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:19,279
or a result post a tear and

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:23,540
about that III think it would definitely

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:27,589
work the the other main issue is that we

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:31,310
should do stuff and we really want to

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:34,550
but then reality happens and that's why

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:37,760
we think github based planning might be

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:40,730
useful so we already started it the URL

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,100
is there and some of the subproblems we

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,149
already defined are already listed so

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:49,370
it's it's you can already give

00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:51,260
structured IDs or in the right place it

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,269
says it's I think it's a good place to

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:58,430
discuss IDs and to hopefully turn them

00:13:53,269 --> 00:14:00,860
into tasks that doesn't get done so that

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:05,810
brings us nicely onto then who is going

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:08,630
to do that stuff that if we go ahead and

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:12,680
find that there is possibility of doing

00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:15,500
a survey like this that who would be

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,180
involved so academics often put their

00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,649
hands up and say I'll be involved and

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,620
then are involved for two or three days

00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:23,540
and then you never see them again and at

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,329
the other side or seven people are busy

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,010
with doing all same stuff so we have to

00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:29,810
see that the people involved in building

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,089
this collaboration and to work on

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,459
suggestions in the survey they are able

00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:36,709
to do so so everyone's work load is

00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:39,199
heavy regardless of which side of the

00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,600
equation you're on and then how do we do

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,220
stuff so how do we build this

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,620
discoordination so the github seems like

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,079
you're a really nice way to centralize

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,350
this where people can pose problems and

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:54,949
we can collect that information as it's

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:57,889
easily easily searchable but to do that

00:14:54,949 --> 00:15:00,230
stuff maybe the mechanics are easy it's

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:02,240
actually doing it is the difficult

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:05,209
and this is where we close with some

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,060
audience participation so what we're

00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:10,160
hoping to do is is by sometime in the

00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,339
last few minutes and get some ideas that

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,899
we can write down and expand on and of

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,089
course we're here all day then for the

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:20,329
academic track so please feel free to

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:22,399
continue to give us ideas and thoughts

00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:25,430
over the day so thanks for listening to

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:31,060
to our part

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:35,290
[Applause]

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:37,999
thanks a lot for the presentation I

00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:42,800
missed the first minutes so I'm a bit

00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:45,769
ashamed to be you know talking now

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:50,149
I saw a website called open science

00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:54,860
portal it's a website where academics

00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:56,709
shared their data so it seems that what

00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:01,249
I what I heard actually already

00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:04,249
partially exists I've seen this you know

00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:06,889
I've seen academics scientist on Tripoli

00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:08,209
gist shared their data set but it's seem

00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:10,819
to me is that they're not able to

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:13,610
structure their data sets in a proper

00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:17,920
geographical with proper geographical

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:20,569
structures so what do you think about

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,980
you know the fact of actually pushing

00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:26,899
for for that and maybe build something

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,610
within what is already existing or do

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:30,620
you think it's still necessary to build

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,319
something outside of what's already

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:38,930
shared by by academics on the Internet

00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:40,850
openly okay I'll take this as a off the

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:44,569
cuff answer I'm familiar with that

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:47,720
website and we are going maybe a step

00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:48,860
just before that that obviously with

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,180
people sharing their data on the

00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,250
internet there are issues about

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,350
structuring it in a in an open in a

00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:58,309
structured and accessible way what we're

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:01,399
looking at is a little bit tangental to

00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:04,010
that is looking at problems that maybe

00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,169
the OSM community can suggest to the

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,689
academic community to work on or the

00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:11,510
academic community can pose problems

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,880
that they consider for OSM and we find

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,429
the middle ground so it's it's slightly

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,890
different one of the outputs should be

00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:21,140
the academic sharing what outputs to

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:24,589
create they create in an open way so

00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:27,199
it's I think open science portal is a

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:28,459
little bit different and I suppose one

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,960
of the problems there might be that some

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,750
of the scientists involved just may not

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,000
be aware of how important it is to to

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:38,860
structure things in in a structured

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,660
format so we are we are a little bit

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,490
you know maybe tangent is around we'll

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,350
probably parallel to the concept of of

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,570
sharing the data that would be one of

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:54,500
the the streams that were looking for

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:57,350
but not the only thing I I was just

00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:01,250
thinking about the scheduling of

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:04,280
something like this because I'm just

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:08,110
wondering how many people are academics

00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,550
here and how many are non academics and

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:15,530
that might be a good we have Sharon's

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:18,380
perhaps how many are academics so how

00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:20,960
many aren't academics and are you are we

00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:25,160
speaking here to the community that you

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,450
want to get involved with and perhaps

00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,530
it's something like this have been

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:32,600
scheduled at the end of a keynote or

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:36,610
later on the day I don't know where

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,800
there's likely to be more of a an OSM

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:42,980
non-academic community where you can

00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:45,500
showcase there's this kind of work

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,000
that may have you know so perhaps

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,760
thinking about that next year's a day to

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,550
the math or something because it's about

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,400
reaching that audience I think it's part

00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:58,160
of it and you know if you can reach the

00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,130
audience you can then perhaps this chin

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,820
thing what works you can perhaps get the

00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,230
audience then on board if you if they're

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,460
actually open to listening to you in the

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:13,520
first place I think that's part of the

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:16,940
part of the issue I think this is

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,450
working I think part of the problem is

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,460
that we like to party so yeah nine

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,790
charity on the second day is maybe not a

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,790
good idea

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:37,549
so am ole ultron promote and I did try

00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,230
and promote that everyone that the

00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:42,740
conference is allowed in the academic

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:46,570
track and Yemi I'm untouched maybe is

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:49,400
the case it was late night and but I

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:54,230
think this track it's great to see this

00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,059
on the conference program and I don't

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:59,510
count myself as an academic my

00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:02,270
undergraduate work however is published

00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:05,540
in the first proceedings of the State of

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:07,490
the map EU it's the only time they've

00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:11,090
done an academic chat and that

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:13,190
conference isn't as regular but maybe

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:16,190
this my questions probably a bit early

00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:20,660
in the day but like is it good doing

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:22,400
this track and obviously so I do what in

00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,290
the university and there's the I know

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,840
there's the grades of conferences of

00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:30,919
which conferences they want to paper in

00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:34,160
and how can we kind of get the the merit

00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:36,950
of of this conference up but you know

00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,950
supervisors want their students to have

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:43,669
papers and present in at this conference

00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,799
is it a case of just repeating it or can

00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:47,510
we can we do more can we tell people

00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:52,549
that this was a really good conference

00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:54,500
okay to hopefully it was okay as the

00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,330
academic here I'll answer that I think

00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,510
that that's a great great suggestion

00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:02,929
because we there is a possibility where

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:06,820
you can over academic okay over a demo

00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:10,030
Phi and maybe is the word this type of

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:13,100
suggestion that the academics come in a

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,290
army like and just swarm the building

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,130
and take over and we certainly don't

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,590
want that to happen

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:21,470
I think Gregory is touched on it there

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:24,980
the way these things can become popular

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:28,220
with with scientists is is true repeat

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:30,290
you know repeat adapt evolve and then

00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,299
repeat again is that this is the first

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,490
one we look maybe next year doing this

00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:39,590
again we look at maybe having this that

00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:42,740
regional state of the maps and there is

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,550
value in academic outputs that are not

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,910
true

00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:49,130
the very highest level conferences there

00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:53,030
is value in scientists producing outputs

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:55,310
that are well used and well sited so it

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:58,040
is something we might look at in more

00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:02,960
published proceedings but we don't want

00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:04,250
to over you know emphasize the academic

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,810
side we want to try and look at

00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,400
something that both sides of the

00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:10,130
community are working together where

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,750
maybe in a few years time an academic

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,030
track is just like every other track

00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:16,570
here that it's not special and it

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:18,680
doesn't require people to try and hurt

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,780
non-academics into it on a Sunday

00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,940
morning so if if there's any academic

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,620
talks but we like in the same way as the

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,350
other talks we should tweet them lots

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,250
and maybe tweet links to the recordings

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,920
when they go online

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:34,790
would that be helpful to that kind of it

00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:38,000
being used not to to tweet just for to

00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:41,780
say no no it has value yes the ones that

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,220
and it's you know I think we we were

00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,520
actually we actually got quite a

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:49,600
response from the academic call so it

00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,920
was quite a hard job to pick twelve

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,210
presentations and then there's actually

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,220
posters that are involved with the

00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,650
academic track as well so that's a very

00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,080
good indication of interest and it's it

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:03,490
the the jobs may be from the state of

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,080
map academic track people is to try and

00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,390
repeat that again next year but maybe go

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,460
another ten percent beyond and come grow

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,030
like that well hopefully we'll try one

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,030
wind okay

00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:29,080
congratulations for this I think it's

00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:32,080
really great and I think it would be a

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,880
really great resource for faculty and

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,370
students to sort of really have a good

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,020
sense of what the needs are so I'm

00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:41,500
really glad to see this is happening

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:44,370
have you thought about creating some

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,870
sort of mirror presence or something on

00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:53,080
someplace where faculty already live

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:55,390
like ResearchGate or I don't know some

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,470
kind of place where there's people who

00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:02,800
don't know about osm per se but they

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,180
kind of use that to promote their

00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,810
research and then they can actually

00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:10,690
discover and find this area I thought

00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:13,030
about that it's a lot of work but yeah

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,860
maybe there's a way to just you know

00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,360
create a presence that then kind of goes

00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:21,850
back to you know what you're trying to

00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:24,040
create on the wiki I think I small

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,510
answer for me and you studying you said

00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,210
a great sentence in his presentation

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,860
yesterday it's that academics need to or

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,390
people need to talk with or Sam in

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,650
places where people have not heard about

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:37,900
OSM and something like that is academics

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,520
need to go to conferences that don't

00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,800
have always same in the title or vgi in

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,960
the title and on top there that would

00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,490
engage others my worry about something

00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:52,210
ResearchGate is that it is very academic

00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:54,280
so it would kind it may be a barrier to

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,380
non academics but it's certainly

00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,000
something worth looking at what we're

00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,130
trying to do is maybe find a middle

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,410
ground and then let the academics begin

00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:06,550
to share these experiences and these

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:09,010
ideas in in in areas like that I think I

00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:11,200
was about seeing about the same I

00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:13,240
thinking about the same thing that it's

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,130
more like a second step perhaps that

00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:20,350
once we get a better way to get results

00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:22,150
communicated and and the questions asked

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,710
from the community that we can go to a

00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:26,880
platform like that and say hey we have a

00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,880
research agenda for you

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,409
okay I think we have to stop here

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,630
because we have to leave couple of

00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:35,190
minutes for those of you want to change

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,870
the room and for new people to come in

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,470
and for the next speaker to present so

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:44,859
thank you very much Peter and used

00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,859
