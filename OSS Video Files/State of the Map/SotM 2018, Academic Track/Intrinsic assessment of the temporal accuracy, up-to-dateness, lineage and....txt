A well-known factor which still limits the widespread use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data is the concern about its quality, which is measured through a variety of parameters such as positional accuracy, completeness, thematic accuracy, temporal accuracy, up-to-dateness and lineage. To date, many approaches have been proposed to assess these parameters for OSM. These approaches can be classified into two categories: extrinsic, when quality assessment happens through the comparison against an external reference dataset (e.g. a governmental map), and intrinsic, when quality assessment happens through the sole analysis of OSM itself. The present work compensates for the almost total absence of intrinsic approaches to assess the OSM quality parameters of temporal accuracy, up-to-dateness, lineage and thematic accuracy. Based on the OSM Full History Planet File and a stack of open source components, a web-based tool was developed (https://is-osm-uptodate.frafra.eu) which, for any selected area, offers thematic visualizations of OSM nodes and ways according to: the date of creation (i.e. first edit); the date of last edit; the number of versions (i.e. the total number of edits); the update frequency; and the number of different contributors who have edited that node or way. A spatial analysis of the results allows to draw some general conclusions. First, temporal accuracy, up-to-dateness and lineage of OSM data are usually higher in urban areas (more “appealing” to map and where more contributors are active) than rural areas. This is in agreement with the results usually found in literature for OSM completeness. However, although the global trend is quite well-defined, at the local level OSM shows very heterogeneous patterns due to the actual presence and mapping activity of contributors, which can be very different even between neighbouring towns. An additional analysis was focused on OSM thematic accuracy, i.e. the accuracy of tags associated to OSM nodes and ways, and its temporal trend for specific object categories (commercial activities, street furniture, natural elements, etc.). For these categories, despite again the typical heterogeneity of OSM contributions, some common recurrences were detected in the order in which tags are added; consequently some trends were defined which, based on the tags available and the order and time of their appearance, can automatically indicate their thematic accuracy.

i'm francesco Facinelli this is my I'm

00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:11,730
going to show some initial result of my

00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:14,950
thesis in Gen 4 Mattox engineering I

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,470
would like to thank dr. Markham in

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:21,160
Guinea and professor Maria Anthony

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,420
Bradley so I I have computer science

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,760
background so I'm not really a

00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,550
researcher so every suggestion and

00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,289
critics is very very welcome in very

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,320
open source and free software style a

00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:34,390
way to operate and I'm also vice pres

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,410
the polymer person opposite not

00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:41,890
contributor and a free software lover

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,140
well whatever you like to do is to try

00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:47,230
to estimate the quality of OpenStreetMap

00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:50,290
of course because this is one of the

00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:53,559
main issue why people are not able to

00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,750
use OpenStreetMap in their work ok

00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:57,280
because you need to know the errors and

00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,770
have an idea about accuracy and

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,329
precision in order to use your data so

00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,360
there are many different criteria that

00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:07,209
you can use special accuracy complete

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:11,289
temporal completeness a consistency from

00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:12,759
a semantic point of view lineage so we

00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:15,399
have two different families

00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,469
the first one is extrinsic that is the

00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:20,109
standard way to do things so basically I

00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:22,770
add OpenStreetMap data and I have an

00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:25,119
outer two outer it ative sorry

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,130
information geographical data base so I

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,450
compare and with something when

00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,029
something different

00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,909
I assume that the alternative to the

00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:35,979
data is the right one it's a nd you can

00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,139
use OpenStreetMap in order to add

00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:40,179
additional attributes of course while

00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:43,029
the intrinsic approach is a bit more

00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:44,829
recent because in some area we cannot

00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:47,439
use these things approach is quite

00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:51,459
negative because in some places we have

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:54,549
a very high quality or open history map

00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:59,619
data or we have buildings that don't

00:01:54,549 --> 00:02:01,779
exist in official cartography so with

00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:05,020
respect to text I will I will like to

00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:06,579
focus on temporal accuracy still

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,289
studying devolution of the database we

00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:10,810
could because as we seen it before we

00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:13,000
have this wonderful file on Open Street

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,970
Map that is the history full file so we

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,240
have the holy story of every

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,220
Justin this is very nice so is the

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,070
presentation will be split and free I

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,880
try to figure out different ways to

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:30,750
approach this geographical time varying

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,240
data so the very fixed the very first

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,920
things I did was to develop a web

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:40,620
application so something that could be

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:43,620
used also for from the community so this

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,690
is my web application open source it's

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:50,130
on github you can use whatever you how

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,180
you prefer so hey I probably this is the

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,810
second day of the conference so you

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:59,910
started to be a bit little bit familiar

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:03,270
with this plan so what do we have we

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:06,660
have different criteria okay in order to

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:09,750
get this point of interest those are

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:13,020
points we are showing points no no it's

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,450
so with attributes just directness -

00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,240
it's at MIT and we are sorting than we

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,750
are showing the last edit so the blue

00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,180
one are the most recent one as with

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,400
respect to last edit and red one are the

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,959
oldest one this is a very simple

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,390
approach in order to let the community

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,880
to explore our data the data that we

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,340
have and also to help the community to

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,860
understand what are the issue the

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,510
possible issue so as soon as a public I

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,370
published this software the Italian

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,790
community initio of course with Italian

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,700
community

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,670
I got good responses from them because

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,430
they started to see oh this is a we have

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,670
some red dots let's double check if this

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:57,450
data is up-to-date or not so we have

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:59,700
different criteria like first edit or

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:03,450
it's not very different here but you can

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:06,480
see some changes so like for example

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,360
tips monument over there it's quite old

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,000
was added at all the monument of course

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,860
and it's also it's been added since a

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,600
long time in OpenStreetMap compared to

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,820
last edit and then we have religion it

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,430
means different version with respect to

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,080
the tags let me change the retailer or a

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:30,620
modifier added deleted modify

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,560
and then we are so we have as you may

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:38,659
see we have very most of the point have

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:41,919
very few provision wipe most of my very

00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:45,169
few points have very high tradition like

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,080
you can see on the top right corner we

00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:51,139
have the this crossing that is has been

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:56,930
modified many many times okay if I want

00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:59,930
to see for example the best if I want to

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,449
see some sees some details about

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:07,849
regarding with this note I see that he

00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:10,389
has 25 21 sorry version okay I've seen

00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:12,500
hey and I guess some basic information

00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:17,150
then I have some links to the

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,919
OpenStreetMap wiki and I I can edit in

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,050
the idea editor I can see the history

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,360
some detail some addition information so

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,900
I'm merging I'm taking data both from

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,819
the let's say day standards an X and a

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,630
hell when I you get the bounding box in

00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:36,080
your editor like jaws and and for every

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:38,840
point I'm also doing separate requests

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,240
on the OSM API server in order to get

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,370
historic information so this is a real

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,409
time I set up a little cash in order not

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:50,419
to overload the lesson API servers well

00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:53,659
we also have contributors what

00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:56,270
contributors mean so contributors means

00:05:53,659 --> 00:06:00,289
then we are counting unique contributors

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:02,150
because for example I call the made some

00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:04,130
men include occasions with the very same

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:08,509
note my baby maybe they call it is not

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:12,680
an hi a good quality for in good in X

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:15,710
for quality because we can assume we

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,840
could try to assume that if a node is

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:22,370
was modified by different people maybe

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,009
we get a more complete tagging and

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,960
update frequency

00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:30,800
it's basically mean how much a node has

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,949
been update and that's it so they say

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,550
modification over time you can also have

00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:39,800
a look at ways okay so we have this base

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,279
layer of OpenStreetMap ties and on top

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,830
of it

00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,500
we are you

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:48,450
in this goj zone that hacks like a

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,370
better tie for it and that's it so you

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,820
can search you can go on get up you can

00:06:50,370 --> 00:07:01,650
push this is a good way to start to have

00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:04,550
a look at your your your place so we go

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,550
back to the presentation

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:10,050
yeah I have a I have a computer

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,360
scientist background I will talk a

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,130
little bit about the technology behind

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,370
it so if you are interested we can talk

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:20,520
also later I'm using OSM api siddhanam

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,830
using the history file for this specific

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,020
program so you can see in real time and

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,940
this is a bit strange because Open

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,980
Street Map API are not really meant to

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,560
to get the full history of many

00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,060
different elements so I'm doing some

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,530
optimization in order to reduce the

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:41,460
latency so taking say 100 elements in

00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:44,120
one time I'm using HTTP pipelining some

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:49,670
kind of new technology the server's is

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:52,440
running my little Python program we and

00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,840
I'm converting it to sequel I'd

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:59,310
specialites so I can I'm able to manage

00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,680
the data okay rest is quite common for

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,780
Python developer point of view and then

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,400
you can also face deploying with docker

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:10,490
and and they make this based on Fedora

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:14,130
so we can have fun with it so then I

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:16,920
moved to an aggregated analysis I didn't

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,920
focus on the different buildings I tried

00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:23,820
to create an executive grid so I'm not

00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,860
taking into account change in geometry

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:31,500
like the previous presentation but I'm

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:33,600
mostly I'm focusing on tags so there is

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,930
no distinction between different nodes

00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,540
associated to ways or just single point

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:43,640
of interests and the letter denotes I'm

00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:46,650
not taking into account account well

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,270
this is our external grade for the

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:52,750
Milano area and as I used to study here

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:57,220
and I I

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:59,560
lived in Milan I tried to interpret this

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,630
data in order to try to understand if a

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,540
criteria or an index could be more

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:09,880
interesting compared to another one for

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:11,890
assessing quality or for example if if

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,840
an index could be used as in order to

00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,600
weight our measures okay

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,540
so for example this is a simple one so

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:24,070
nodes per square metre kilometer okay

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:27,250
you see we have its we have 500 meter of

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:30,070
radius just to give you an idea and we

00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:34,300
see a very simple distinction between

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:36,330
the center of Milan the periphery the

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,880
the south term mostly this outer part

00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:43,600
that is not very you urban so you have

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,990
fields over there so we can take this

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,360
into account for our consideration well

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,120
this is the creation the average of the

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,150
creation time and can we see it

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,510
basically that the suburbs are going to

00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:01,630
get mapped the map them have been mapped

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:05,110
more recently so this is not this is

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:08,050
interesting it's quite expected is not

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,260
something really strange and the so we

00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:13,900
can try to also think about that when

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,060
the center of the city get mapped so

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,290
people start to map outside because

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:22,960
there are many information that are

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:25,600
missing so also we have the last edit

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,640
the average this is a very simple

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,170
interest to have an idea about what's

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:37,660
happening just edit update frequency

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:41,020
this is that aggregated one we have we

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:44,500
can see I'm also here that people are

00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,710
white peers in the middle is quite the

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:51,070
same way the whole don't have very

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:53,290
difficult discrepancies we are

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:56,949
the node outside that have been updated

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:59,680
but still so I started to ask myself if

00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:02,410
this kind of map could show that Milan

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:08,800
is going is having a good level of

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:10,720
completeness maybe with version I've

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,130
seen something bit strange I have to say

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:18,639
because we don't have some big blocks

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:21,820
with dark color and I ask myself what

00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:24,579
are these parts of banana so looking at

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,459
Milano map I lost my statement I think

00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:29,199
that maybe there are nodes and straight

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:31,269
that are really related with viability

00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,720
we are building new metro lines in

00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,800
Milano

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,940
so you've seen many change so it's many

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:42,100
maybe something that is related to

00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:46,510
transportation mostly and then we are

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:50,019
the contributors the contributors also

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:55,930
the crossing and very critical points

00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:58,870
were then through streets then we have

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:01,089
contributors total total number and

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,250
that's easier to interpret because we

00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:06,699
have the center and then we have this

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:09,880
the area close to my knowledge in

00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:11,769
trolley and the Politecnico street us to

00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,709
do this so we're poly mappers are and

00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:19,899
cetera so it's quite expected and then

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:23,649
we have a dark dot that hexagon and this

00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:30,279
is where we do some map time events so

00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:33,010
it's the matches so with respect to this

00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:39,310
part what I use ok

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:42,959
I am i use the the planet history fool

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:47,709
that is around 100 megabytes of data and

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:50,529
I try to use osmium as Python library in

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:52,589
order to extract data and push it on a

00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:55,480
sequin at amis as you might understand

00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:58,300
now I'm really a fan of sequel databases

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,579
or Odyssey to do this kind of analysis

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,690
so sequel I'd that's Pasha light and

00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:06,450
this approach work

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:08,820
city see cities and also nationwide I do

00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,250
this I did a similar analysis on Italy

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,730
too but I don't think that the the best

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,279
way to use it on a global scale that's

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,810
it this is why I tried many different

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,990
approach with different databases

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,610
because the critical part in this case

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,910
is the import of the data because you

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,910
cannot aspire the know of course feel

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,790
free to block me later

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:37,079
I don't know if we cannot use PDF

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:39,930
databases on the fly so but I found that

00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,790
there are who are see that the bases

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,970
that are provided for free that has a

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:47,160
PDF conversion and you can use for

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,010
example I am trying to use them with

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,500
Park in hives or big data approach for

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,709
this or and also will try to experiment

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,600
with postcode sequel and Cetus first in

00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:01,050
Posca sequel you have foreign data

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,240
proper approach module for trying to

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:06,570
access to OpenStreetMap data directory

00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,930
but still you don't have indexes in your

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,850
database so it's very very slow it's

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,890
used mostly for import in this case it

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,089
on a single thread we have two minutes

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,100
for the conversion and one for

00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:21,000
aggregation statistic so it's quite fast

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,709
for me and we quite a long sequel

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,100
queries in order to get these results

00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:30,180
that's it music quite QJ s and the

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:36,149
plug-in is pretty great so what about

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:39,839
semantic accuracy let's start to ask our

00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:42,000
staff bit more complex questions I would

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,180
like to know to have a look at the

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,690
evolution of our news so what happens

00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:51,209
from if we have some general trends or

00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:54,839
not so I consider the nosy me lad as I

00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:56,790
told you before and the top 100 most

00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,920
popular tags in order to have something

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:02,370
that is quite significantly from a

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,740
statistical point of view so I try to

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,890
understand for example if there are some

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:11,069
tags that are added before other taxes

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,510
if there is this kind of evolution so

00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:15,570
I'm going to show you a very simple

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:19,230
example that is uncontrolled crossing

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:23,130
okay we see that in almost 60% of the

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:25,740
time we have the highway crossing and

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,460
crossing and control they are added in

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:32,460
the very same version of the note while

00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:34,920
14-month percent of the time crossing

00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:38,430
and control is added later in a literal

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,070
version still to say sweat stronger

00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:45,060
ation so we could assume for example

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:49,740
that a after B so the opposite so crusty

00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:53,430
and control before highway crossing the

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:56,250
a could be an error for example that has

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,740
been fixed so we can also think that for

00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,250
nodes that have crossing uncontrolled

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,480
but not Highway and highway crossing tag

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,580
this could be an arrow that could be

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,760
fixed in fact I found the poor note for

00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:13,610
example that have has been but - not

00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:17,640
tagged as a okay 65% of the node has no

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:19,950
cross intact okay just so high highway

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,800
crossing without crossing basically so

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,970
theses and they of completeness because

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,340
I don't I found that for example highway

00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,320
crossing has no default value but all

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,870
this consideration will come are made

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,610
without having to look at the weekend

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:40,380
just looking at the raw data if we are

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:42,630
able to separate something yeah so we

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,740
can say that B is a natural evolution of

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:49,590
a that's that's the main idea behind it

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,630
let's move a little bit further so let's

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,060
play with three different tags so a

00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:57,450
before tag b and b before texting in

00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:02,400
different version so bench's let's talk

00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:05,610
about the benches 845 nodes with a

00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:09,440
manatee bench we call a backrest

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:12,750
backrest act big and material C so it's

00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,910
Himalayas quite nice because straight

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:18,030
because in my opinion because I almost

00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,760
in 60% of the case we had this exact

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:24,360
evolution in different version we're not

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,280
talking about the same version so really

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,439
people are mapping before bench and then

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,960
they are best back backrest and then add

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,890
very

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,010
they had the material well I mean 40% of

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:38,529
the time we have different orders so

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,990
maybe at the same time or maybe just an

00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:43,240
ad bench and backrest and material in

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:48,120
the same version the so we have a very

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:50,980
different mix order consideration I

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,659
remember that for example in during

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,190
Christmas time we had the paulina

00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:57,279
peradventure that is was an initiative

00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:00,159
of Polly mappers we're like an advent

00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,919
calendar where every day you can do a

00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,990
different task so to get familiar travel

00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:08,080
for me familiar with OpenStreetMap and

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,990
we had a couple of quest related with

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,390
benches so maybe this could be affected

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,549
but still 845 are all top

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,470
thanks a lot of benches so maybe three

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:20,529
something more or maybe we had a greater

00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:25,419
impact that expected there's something

00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:27,490
interest also because I have to move for

00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:30,250
most of the notes after three for tags

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,130
we reach something like a plateau so we

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,940
have this kind of curve and evolution

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,700
and then it stops

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,990
so we update tags and cetera but we

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,549
don't add new tags

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:46,480
except for Wikimedia wiki data tags and

00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:49,029
the for natural rated tags because they

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,760
are quite special like leaf type trees

00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:56,710
and so on they have a lot of tags so

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,899
conclusion what we have now we have the

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,789
web application that you can use just to

00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:04,179
have a look at and explore your data and

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:06,429
have a look at your place and see if

00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:08,860
it's up to date or not and maybe find

00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:10,690
some outliers and press on the button in

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,230
order to add it and see what's happening

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:17,890
there so I tested different approach

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,990
because this is maybe the main technical

00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,460
issue with this kind of analysis I'm

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,340
very happy that we seen on the previous

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:27,630
presentation some proposals in order to

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:31,539
standardize our approach to this kind of

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:35,860
issues especially I found that there are

00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:42,050
we don't have many tools and a database

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:44,390
schema for treating history so the

00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:47,210
I found on the awesome week that we have

00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:49,520
some all the proposal compared to that

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:53,570
last year is something that has to be

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,030
developed further so as a state of the

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:58,880
map 2018 is for sure a great place to

00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,050
discuss between us and their performance

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,610
issue because we are dealing with very

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:07,100
big databases and many tools don't scale

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:09,080
and so and then and then I show you some

00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:15,800
preliminary results then then we can

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:19,490
discuss if you liked maybe if we

00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:25,700
possible developments for the future

00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:28,460
I would like to add some some tiles for

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,580
the web application export test use JSON

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,920
ah just one thing you can use the

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,630
application locally without having to

00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,580
use the browser you can just a load and

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,350
use it from the common law as with a

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,800
common line interface and it will

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:44,810
download education that you can process

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,580
maybe use the awesome planet does it

00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,740
make it sense I will have to convert

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,260
every day so probably we will not up to

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,510
date I would have a very high load on

00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:59,150
the server maybe so for now I'm just

00:20:53,510 --> 00:21:01,310
using go SMA pis and probably we cannot

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,310
do a complete analysis without taking

00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:06,170
into account that different point of

00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,630
interest different points different

00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,310
nodes have different peculiarities so

00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:14,060
for example trash bin you map it once

00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:16,730
and then probably you will not update we

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:19,300
just delete it or move them but will not

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,590
add or change tanks for trash bin and

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,420
understanding Inglot friends because of

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:26,840
course they are relevant so we cannot

00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:32,210
stand for other areas and we did a paper

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:35,690
or for foss4g related to Dar es Salaam

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:37,940
area semantic reality we are not

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,790
analyzing waste for example and we are

00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,180
not we should okay correlate with line

00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:46,970
user population and then as I told you

00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:48,860
every criticism and suggestion is

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:52,150
welcome thank you

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,150
[Applause]

00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:59,260
thank you very much we have three

00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,700
minutes for questions please raise your

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:16,450
hand and then we will bring them back to

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:18,520
you hi thanks for your interesting talk

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,000
about your research I actually have two

00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,130
questions so first of all do you plan to

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,860
do any correlations for example on what

00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:29,860
you saw the location between communities

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,500
and the number of edits and the second

00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,780
question is how do you tie in into

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,419
existing research because I know there's

00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,770
already quite a lot of research on

00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:41,380
awesome quality and the measures that

00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,120
you use so I think that's something to

00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,340
think about

00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,840
yeah so thank you if I understood

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,260
correctly your first point of first

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,610
question there are many different ways

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,299
to try to analyze me there are many

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:58,410
different metrics so we can have

00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:01,150
contributed contributors number of edits

00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:03,790
may be as we seen on the previous

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:05,230
presentation we could also take in

00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,540
conduct to consideration

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,570
the history of the single contributor

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,549
because one is more experienced than the

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:15,309
other but is something that you we

00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:17,470
really have to go deeper this is our

00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:21,010
preliminary results and with respect to

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:23,530
the existing result our research in this

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:26,169
field I will have I will have to say

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:28,720
that while we have some research and

00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:30,549
very interesting research that I write

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,530
I'm still reading and explore because

00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:34,900
there are a lot of very cool references

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,760
have to say so I consider myself a

00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,549
newcomer of these areas

00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,260
please forgive myself if I make some

00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:44,950
mistakes or if I don't know the whole

00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:47,679
literature about it I will say that the

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:50,620
main idea in this case is to have an

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,929
intrinsic approach okay with for

00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:56,980
temporal analysis that is amazing

00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:59,530
feature and the third one is to not have

00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:03,820
a look at

00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:05,620
a priori knowledge from wiki and so just

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,380
look at the raw data and the devolution

00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,900
of the data from a 10-person standpoint

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:15,640
so there are some summaries just search

00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:21,280
that are similar and where I will decide

00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:23,590
which this why I added pretty important

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,270
let's say exploration in this field and

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:28,330
then according to the literature I will

00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:31,750
try to go deep on one side and then try

00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:33,610
to cover something a bit different for

00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,890
my final thesis and I will try to

00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:38,560
publish as many things as possible as

00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,970
open source free and cetera in order to

00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,660
give back to the community because I'm

00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:45,940
really I really think that I mean I got

00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,210
so many things from USM an open source

00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:52,500
community so I need to give people back

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:55,500
and share because that's the main reason

00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Thanks

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,780
thanks Francesco that's a very loud

00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:12,700
microphone the visualization of the

00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,320
history is real step forward the two

00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,900
presentations we've seen something I

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,080
might suggest with the tagging scheme is

00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,240
to not completely ignore looking at the

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,010
the tagging from the the wiki because

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,260
that might help you I think one of the

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:27,549
academic questions that is very

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,460
interesting in the work you've done

00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:33,760
there is if if a node has not been

00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:35,650
edited in ten years one of the ways we

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,080
can find out why that might possibly be

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,169
is by looking at the wiki so for the

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,030
statue out at the front of the Piazza

00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:44,860
statues don't really change very much so

00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,400
it's not surprising that that would not

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:50,409
be edited

00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:52,480
but the crossing so I think if maybe

00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:55,150
this is a step after your PhD but that's

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,289
you this work could generate a list of

00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:01,360
tasks that would suggest to people what

00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:03,640
could be updated but it would need to

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,080
look at the tagging I think so that we

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,809
don't suggest that we update every

00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,780
statue in in Milan unless there is some

00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:12,820
major major reason for that but traffic

00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,610
crossings are an obvious team building

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,890
use etc so the visualization is

00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:20,679
fantastic but I think a really good

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:24,429
knowledge output would be a set of tasks

00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:28,990
that mappers 10 could actually somehow

00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:31,360
connect you and actually do in in their

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:34,600
spare time I totally agree with you with

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,799
respect to the week here let's say that

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,210
in order to start to do with the data if

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,750
you look at the wiki you have many

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:46,600
differences so I would like to see at

00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:50,559
the beginning something like okay I've

00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:53,980
seen that new nodes that are monuments

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,230
okay without too technically new if only

00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,820
what a monument is because the Machine

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,940
doesn't know it and I didn't put a

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,640
preset let's see if the analysis if we

00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,190
are able to produce an analysis that

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,370
sees that the the monument don't change

00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:11,320
too much so we are going to suggest that

00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:13,330
for example it's fine to have a moment

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,549
that is being updated ten years ago

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:18,390
that's that's it without for example

00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:21,090
saying manually that was the idea

00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,890
okay let's set a time line up the

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,220
frequency update time with something

00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,810
like these four monuments statically

00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,970
yeah if I can just add you know that

00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:32,640
different types of points of interest of

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,830
course have different may change or may

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,900
not so this is why Francesca said this

00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,520
was just the first step second step

00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:42,000
would be of course to categorize points

00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,980
some will may continue to evolve someone

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,200
not like the building numbers for

00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,260
instance they may not evolve anymore so

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,780
maybe the maximum quality can be read

00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,850
just after the first version and the

00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,200
second thing about the week is that as

00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,970
you know because we did something

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,220
together sometimes the week is not

00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,780
followed even in tagging so at the first

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,130
approximation we decided not to look at

00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,960
the week not to look at the suggested

00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,120
tags to be used in combination and then

00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,460
maybe a second one can be again to see

00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,280
if the evolution reflects the wiki but

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:16,280
sometimes it will not we already know

00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:16,280
