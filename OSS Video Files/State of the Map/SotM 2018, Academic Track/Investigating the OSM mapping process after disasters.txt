Humanitarian emergencies are among the most important applications of OpenStreetMap (OSM). At the international level, humanitarian mapping activities are coordinated by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) through ad hoc tools such as the Tasking Manager (TM). Due to the distributed nature of OSM volunteers, the investigation on who, when, how long and how exactly contributes map data during emergencies is an interesting, yet highly unexplored topic. The purpose of this work is to study the dynamics of the OSM mapping process happened after the earthquakes in Central Italy in 2016, which caused 299 victims and almost 400 injured people. The first big shock (ML 6.0) was registered at the end of August, followed by non-stop schocks over the following months with magnitude peaks at the end of October (ML 6.5). Despite the richness of technologies to analyse and process OSM data, no tools were available which answered the specific needs of the study. Therefore, a new software named OsmEventAnalyst was developed. Written in Python, it is available at https://github.com/osmItalia/OsmEventAnalyst under the GPL license. The tool is based on the OSM Full History Planet File (containing the whole history of OSM) and the OSM tile log (containing the number of visits to OSM map tiles) and uses several open source tools such as Osmium and PostgreSQL/PostGIS. Results show that about 60% of all contributors (506) who made at least one edit in the earthquake area throughout 2016, have modified the area after the first event, and that 83% of these were already registered to OSM before the first event. Thus the response from the OSM community, facilitated by a TM instance setup by the Italian community and using post-event satellite imagery, was mainly driven by already experienced contributors. Almost the 90% of OSM objects in the area were not modified after the earthquakes, while the objects with changes in geometry were about twice those with changes in the tags. Finally, OSM tiles in the study area were almost not visited at all before the event; this was followed by expected peaks after the main events and still a good number of visualizations after a few months. To conclude, this study has shed light on the OSM mapping process happened after the Italian earthquakes in 2016. The software developed, which returns results in the form of files and plots, can be easily reused to analyze OSM mapping activity corresponding to any other event.

okay so the question is was what is the

00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,120
author of the community to a disaster so

00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,269
the idea was to understand a little bit

00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:18,789
better which part of the community and

00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:23,320
mappers joined the map effort after the

00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:26,349
disaster so I hope that everyone here is

00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,199
no ought there is someone that doesn't

00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:33,640
know what it is

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:37,540
no okay I can skip this for five

00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:42,700
sentences maybe you know better than me

00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:45,220
so I can hide some mistake so what

00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:48,040
happened when there is a disaster and so

00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:53,730
after the emergency the people start to

00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:58,150
map using hold information like old

00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:02,940
aerial images or satellite images and in

00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:05,469
the same time someone is starting some

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,799
task manager' project the task manager

00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:11,350
is a software online software that was

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,280
developed by hot to manage this

00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:20,259
situation because in obviously mapper is

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:23,350
quite simple to make mistake if a lot of

00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:26,740
people is mapping the same area with

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:30,159
different versions and of the same

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,499
object and you can make some mistake so

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,259
with the task manager you should be able

00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:39,549
to don't create any problem on the map

00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:41,950
on the date of opus tree map so the

00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:45,999
tasking manager should be used by the

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,880
community to manage all the activities

00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:52,659
because if you start to use the tasking

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,969
manager you can select an area and say

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:58,179
I'm mapping this area please don't turn

00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:00,389
map in the same area and in this way

00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:04,600
there should be not be conflict and

00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:06,670
during Aven disaster event also hundreds

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,450
of people in the same time could map on

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:13,020
the same area so comfortably quite

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,020
frequent

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:20,659
what happened in Italy two years ago in

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:23,719
August - t - of 2016 at 336 there was a

00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:26,389
really strong earthquake in the center

00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:29,150
of Italy and it was the stronger of

00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:33,079
really long serious earthquake as molar

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:37,280
earthquake and in this earthquake there

00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:44,469
was around 300 people died so it was

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:49,579
quite a big impact for for the area at

00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:52,489
5:44 there was the first data headed in

00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:55,579
opposite event we check it on the planet

00:02:52,489 --> 00:03:01,810
after the earthquake when the people

00:02:55,579 --> 00:03:04,280
start to to map the area one hour after

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,709
there was the first message on the

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,209
Italian mailing list saying there is the

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:15,409
earthquake what we can do and 5 hour or

00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:19,849
5 5 hour later or 4 hour later there was

00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:22,609
a tasking task started on the Italian

00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:26,470
tasking manager the Wikimedia Italia me

00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:31,280
Wikimedia chapter as a server and they

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:34,459
set up the tasking manager we are using

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,150
four different events also some small

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:40,939
project and so we started with the first

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:46,030
task we activate three tasks for this

00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:50,090
event the earthquake continue until the

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:54,439
January 2017 and there was other - quite

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:58,040
strong in October luckily if I remember

00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:01,729
well this - there was not people dying

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,159
because it was in the better day time

00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:06,680
the first one was during night everyone

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,250
who was sleeping and the second was

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:14,590
during morning and people start to wake

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,590
up and so it was a little bit better

00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:20,750
this is the task manager that we this

00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:25,710
the 15 is the last one with the newer

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:29,039
data the 13 was using the old

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:32,850
imagine a to map the building because

00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:37,380
the building are used by the Copernicus

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:41,430
rapping man mapping agency maybe some of

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:45,750
you doesn't know this copernica rapid

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,910
mapping activities that is a group of

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,620
people working for Jersey they join a

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:58,229
research center of Europe and they are

00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:01,530
working to mapping in a really fast time

00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:06,449
what is happening for disaster there are

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:10,259
some entity in the world that can ask to

00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:14,190
start a new project and at that time

00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,870
after 24 hour the people the people

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,020
working on the project has to provide

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,229
some data and quite often they use

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:26,070
obviously map data because it's not

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:28,139
completed but it's standardized so you

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:33,000
can manage more or less everywhere the

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:36,990
same kind of data and so they used our

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,810
data that was more or less our early

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,550
updated with the building they put

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,039
inside of the building all the

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:48,180
information about the collapsed building

00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:50,669
or really high damage building and we

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,560
got back the data and we put in a stream

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:59,099
under the code to get the data from the

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,550
Copernicus is on github there was some

00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:10,139
WMS services to get the data online and

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:12,419
to use them on the map so the the first

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,720
slide we want to investigate what

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:20,400
happened so who is the who are the

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:26,810
matter that give a help to improve the

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:29,940
data and what they do so we write a

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,370
small piece of Python code that is

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,430
called awesome event analyst and you can

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,320
reuse for any kind of event also not a

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,660
disaster also for

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:49,830
like for mapping party you could use it

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:52,310
and it was this the error so we are in

00:06:49,830 --> 00:07:01,700
the center of Italy this Rome

00:06:52,310 --> 00:07:01,700
we are here in Milan and each

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,919
each point is an earthquake the darker

00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:17,719
are stronger and lighter are little bit

00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:22,949
less problematic that two strongest are

00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:33,889
one this is the red one behind and the

00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:39,120
other one here Mira I'm a teacher so we

00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:45,240
study first the user and we divide the

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:48,780
user in five group the user that they

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,259
map only before the event the user that

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:55,050
map before and after the event this

00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:58,409
probably are the user that are living in

00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,900
the data area because they don't make

00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:02,669
only after the disaster so they want to

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:08,819
add the community but the map also

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:12,050
before existing user that met only after

00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:15,779
the disaster and after the two kind of

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:19,819
new user so the new user that make the

00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:22,500
first point outside the study area and

00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:29,069
new user that to make the first point

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:31,830
inside the study area so this user

00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:35,699
probably our new user because they want

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:42,990
to help in the in the map of the

00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:46,350
disaster as you can see the majority it

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:49,620
was by existing user so people that

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:54,779
already know how to you how to map and

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:58,680
how to help a stream up and a lot of

00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:02,370
people map only before and really few

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,970
people start to contribute at that time

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:11,730
we were thinking about the complexity of

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:15,170
map and disaster event because the topic

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:18,270
is a really specific you are not

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,379
enjoying your activity usually when you

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,639
go how to make

00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:25,829
is something that you enjoy and but

00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,689
after in the last slide I will show that

00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:33,660
if something is different around the

00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:38,159
world here you can see the statistic how

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:41,179
many data was inserted by the several

00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:44,459
classes and you can see again that the

00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:48,329
existing user before and after are the

00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:51,569
more useful in this kind of event in

00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:54,329
Italy at least in this plot you can see

00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:57,779
the contribute the daily contribution

00:09:54,329 --> 00:10:03,899
and the small big peak is the first day

00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:07,470
after the earthquake and this again is

00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:11,639
after the October earthquake so you can

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,679
see that after the disaster the activity

00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:20,539
start again and they increase a little

00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:25,019
bit the the map this again the daily

00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:28,829
date number of edit for user classes

00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:31,709
this for the first earthquake so almost

00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:35,519
started from the 24 of August to

00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:37,679
November 2 September something you can

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,559
see that there are more or less three

00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:45,929
weeks of high activity and the same is

00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,329
replicate for the October event here

00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:50,970
it's a little bit longer maybe some 10

00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:54,709
days instead three weeks but more or

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:57,779
less the the day that people want to

00:10:54,709 --> 00:11:01,829
work on the map is like three weeks

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:05,100
maybe because all the data was hadded I

00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:08,309
don't think so but after a while you

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,239
maybe feel that the map is full and you

00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:19,049
don't have any or also people to do

00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:22,559
something has the second part of the

00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:28,049
analysis is about the data and in this

00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:30,689
case really few data was modified so the

00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:33,000
yellow is the data that are not modified

00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:35,000
after the event so there was

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,170
already-existing before the event and

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,450
they remain as you like them also after

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:46,590
so there was no changing in geometry in

00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:51,150
tax and the green one was the data

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:54,420
headed after the event but they was also

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:57,840
modified by someone else or by the same

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,250
user he had some new tags or new Jerome

00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,630
it only changed a little bit the

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:06,150
geometry and the red one are all data so

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:08,970
data that was already in the open stream

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,730
of database before the event and they

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:15,120
was modified after for example all the

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:20,390
collapses building should be or removed

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,390
or better marketers collapse it and

00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,320
polygons are really few polygons I don't

00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,210
think so I don't understand why because

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,720
the building should be modified or

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,130
there's really small part are all

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,110
buildings and they didn't modify

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:40,440
anything else or I have not really

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:44,160
answered to that here we can see instead

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:49,080
what the user change mainly they changed

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:52,620
the geometry in all the element followed

00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:56,100
by geometry in the new element and the

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,470
same we can see for tags so tags for all

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,260
the element attacks for new elements so

00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:05,339
for the new element make sense that not

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:09,890
many tags are modified because they are

00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,890
quite new data and they remain like just

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:20,250
and last part of the analogy is about

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:21,870
the tile so we download dialogue that is

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,140
available on the planet

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:29,400
tapaswi Maputo torge to understand if

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:32,160
there was interest also outside the

00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,850
community because the map is visualized

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,430
by a lot of different services a lot of

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,940
different people and also in this case

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:45,120
you can see that there is a big peak on

00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,550
the day of the disaster and there is

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,760
going down

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:56,690
the time we checked also the tile that

00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:01,970
is the title of a Mitrich I'm a teacher

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:04,339
is the one of the famous place where the

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,620
earthquake came because there is a

00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:08,600
pastor amatriciana that it's quite

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:14,959
famous around the world and is coming

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:19,700
from this village Amma Trisha is famous

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:21,980
for this pork hand is something like

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:26,950
that is a pancetta I don't know in

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:32,329
English and the pancetta is the main

00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:37,850
dish of pasta LaMotta chana and so there

00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:41,029
was a lot of help from the USA because

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:44,209
there was a pastor lamentation so you

00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:48,350
can see that the graph the plot is more

00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:52,250
or less the same for all the tile level

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:56,899
we start from the room 12 going to room

00:14:52,250 --> 00:15:00,770
19 there is also the room 15 with a

00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:02,990
different pattern probably four I didn't

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:06,529
check but probably there are some other

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:08,959
big village inside this room probably

00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:11,660
there is room also so a lot of people

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,730
are looking for room it's visiting also

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:18,850
the same tile of Hama teacher at that

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:22,370
level this my idea but I'm not sure so

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:25,310
this is the capability of Osman event

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:32,630
analyst is able to analyze the user data

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:36,260
and ties this was written in 2017 I try

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:38,630
to run again the this project or for two

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,790
different area but I discovered that a

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,399
lot of stuff from the last year changes

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:47,630
for example we are using a tool of

00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:50,870
Pascal neighs that now required login

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:53,630
and so you cannot get the same values as

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,500
before and the word Sam was changing

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:59,470
also in the

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:02,440
in the eastery in the diff file for

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:05,680
example the changeset are not even more

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,800
with the NID or the change set now after

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,070
the same ID inside the the ultimate data

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,110
that you can get so what I want to show

00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:18,340
you okay sorry before there are some

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:22,360
result so in this case is the rosters

00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:25,330
right so it's perfect the copy mapping

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,670
was done by experienced user at least in

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:32,710
our case we will see that in other case

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:35,620
there are different pattern in in our

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:38,380
case again the most of the odd object

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,630
was not modified so this is a really

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,630
strange because for my point of view a

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:47,410
lot of data probably was old and they

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:50,440
should be modified and of course the

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:54,850
tasking manager the TM is crucial to

00:16:50,440 --> 00:17:01,690
avoid this problem with duplicates and

00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:05,290
with conflict so this is some plot that

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:09,640
I just got yesterday from to the

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:12,490
different disaster one is a IET it is

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,579
quite famous I'm sorry to say this but

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:19,030
because it is the first big event were

00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:21,970
the open stream up community show to the

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:26,470
world of how to use OPC map for this

00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:28,329
kind of even and Sri Lanka was quite

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:32,890
simple to analyze for my point of view

00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:35,110
and so I use it and in this case okay

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:37,810
there is not different between the new

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,080
user that make the point inside the area

00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:44,350
and outside but you can see that the new

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:48,810
user are more and more respect of our

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:53,230
case probably the internationality and

00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:57,070
the yeah internationality and also et

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:59,850
was a big disaster bigger than Hauer so

00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,850
it was a

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,990
around the world everyone know about

00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:09,920
that so provide new user was interested

00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:12,530
to to join the mapping effort in Sri

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,830
Lanka is more as the same what is really

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:19,420
different was the existing data so you

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:22,640
can see that in I 18 2010 there was only

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:25,850
3.4 percent of the data was modified

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,950
before the event by the user instead in

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:31,100
Sri Lanka more most of the 50 percent

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:34,760
was already present after the disaster

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:37,940
ok we are speaking 6 year after so open

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:41,420
serum mapping this six year became more

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,820
more and more bigger project with more

00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,830
people mapping and so it's quite normal

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:49,820
but you can seeing there are some

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:51,920
differences here is again a plot to show

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:57,110
the different classes and how they

00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:59,210
contribute the the points are number

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,520
outside the standard deviation and you

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:05,840
can the box plot is inside the standard

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,610
deviation so this is everything please

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,730
few questions because I have to run to

00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:14,000
take the train if you want you can write

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,760
me a email I will ask you if you I'm

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,770
joking please I have to run really but I

00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:26,960
can answer okay perfect timing

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:28,820
fast questions fast answers very fast I

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,470
will try I was actually in a bruit so

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,740
drop the auth quake I was in Monte

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,260
Cassino it was it was quite bad and I

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:39,080
remember that many Italians did not have

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:43,160
internet access because the Italians in

00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:46,820
this part of Italy are not connected in

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:49,400
that case how can we cross the the data

00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,460
from Twitter for example with Wes M data

00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,670
have you thought about the fact that you

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,700
know of being able to cross this with

00:19:54,670 --> 00:20:00,110
the few information that can be brought

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:04,610
bottom you know from the yeah from

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:07,580
bottom up so I how to manage this but I

00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:11,890
know that in at least in Italy for this

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:14,890
kind of event there is some specific

00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:18,429
to provide Internet access to everyone

00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:21,990
in the meantime possible I know that

00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:26,910
it's quite difficult but I know that

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:29,500
digital folk is the fire fight

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,840
firefighters was there to provide the

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,720
interconnection in Nam a teacher for

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,710
sure I don't know I've also not the city

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,730
for sure yeah this is a problem but for

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:44,890
example we was able to communicate with

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:48,970
these people and for example they send

00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:51,700
us some GPX and they was without okay

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:54,270
they was with really limited internet

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,429
access but they was able to send G Peaks

00:20:54,270 --> 00:21:00,040
for example there was a bridge collapse

00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:02,620
it and they made the new road and they

00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,900
send us the new road and the day after

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,760
we was a that they opened the new road

00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:11,340
that we was able to put on obviously map

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,340
so it was useful for four people

00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,350
so given what you know about who

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:33,500
responded and the fact that they were

00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,940
mostly Italian or mostly abroad and

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:42,340
mostly people who were experienced

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:45,470
mappers so we try to check that the

00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:50,020
simple idea was to use this Paschal nice

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:53,870
tool that returned the first point and I

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:55,010
think that the 95 percent or more 99

00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,320
percent was Italian

00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:59,930
so the first point that they made was in

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:04,000
Italy okay I'm not sure that there is a

00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:06,470
people that is living in Italy but okay

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,450
how will that change the way that you

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:12,070
try to reach out to people in the

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:15,710
inevitable next earthquake probably

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,960
using the odd tasking manager could be

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,780
an idea because the Italian tasking

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,640
manager is visible mainly for Italian

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,250
people because probably you don't know

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,050
that there is a tasking manager for from

00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,820
Italy but you know that there is the

00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:32,780
task manager from OTT so this could be

00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:36,110
for sure an idea but since we have it

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:37,640
makes sense to use it probably for the

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,410
future could be I don't know because now

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,840
there is the new version of tasks in

00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:44,840
Manor the task manager could be useful

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,360
to have a fader 8 tasking manager so you

00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,420
can see also the tasks from other

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,600
tasking manager instance I know it's an

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:56,830
idea but someone has to implement it I

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,830
haven't got time to do that

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:19,679
I just want to ask so until you have an

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,130
explanation that why

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:29,210
a year after 95% have not changed so

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:35,220
they're all the buildings remain

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:38,760
destructed and and like average is not

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:43,289
from the actual data was from last year

00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,710
data but still yeah it's worse than the

00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,529
average

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:49,710
steep map updates like it's an idea I

00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:52,230
don't know why I have not asked but it's

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:57,299
a really strange no I mean it's it's

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:59,909
perhaps like we to be over engaged just

00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:02,970
to a tool to help and and then run away

00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:03,840
yeah yeah yeah because could be an

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:09,240
explanation

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:12,630
yeah this could be yeah but in theory no

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,450
because the tool is looking for the

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:18,840
change set version or Dannette the

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:21,029
number of version and is checking if the

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,120
version is changing before and after the

00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:27,779
event so at least the building that was

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:34,200
already there and they change it should

00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:37,100
appear like change it so for building I

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:41,610
was expecting a little more and more

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:44,070
modifying out object it's really I would

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:46,640
like to make the seminary for IET and

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:50,279
Sri Lanka sees there are a lot of old

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,279
data already especially for us Lanka and

00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:56,010
check if there at least is changing

00:24:53,279 --> 00:25:00,080
something maybe could be also a bag of

00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:00,080
the software I don't I don't know but

00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:13,360
the dissipation in the map or in the in

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:15,940
the land I think that it's more or less

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:23,049
the same as last year we are we are

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:25,600
still in 2008 there was a ocular 9 2009

00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:31,179
we had the earthquake close to this area

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:33,720
and right now after 9 year the city

00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:37,750
center is still

00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,880
unavailable for residents they build a

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,270
new village of outside they give them

00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:46,480
some hood houses but they previous

00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:49,810
houses are still there as nine year ago

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,030
without the ability to go there inside

00:25:49,810 --> 00:26:01,090
them so I think there should be the same

00:25:52,030 --> 00:26:03,910
more or less yeah ausma data during it

00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:06,790
am at reach event was that you provided

00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:09,340
actually the footprint of buildings for

00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,590
Copernicus you will have been the first

00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:14,470
one so I can witness that that was

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:16,780
really really important and I can say

00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:20,260
that maybe there are known changes

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:22,060
because in that part okay you had that

00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,850
building now the building has been

00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:27,790
destroyed but all the same that was a

00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:31,930
reference for all processes that have

00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:34,510
been developed yeah but we modify it I

00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:36,610
deem that is collapse it should appear

00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:40,060
done yes but other attributes not as

00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:42,340
fruitful yeah yeah yeah thank you so

00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,200
we'll have to stop there to allow some

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,880
change over to allow Luca not to miss

00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,990
his train and we'll put our hands

00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,230
together for a very interesting

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,230
