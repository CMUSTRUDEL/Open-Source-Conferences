This is a work-in-progress report about "Areas-of-Interest" (AOI) for OpenStreetMap (OSM) using big spatial data analytics. OSM is a free map of the world based on a collaborative, volunteered effort. OSM is a promising, yet underestimated alternative to Google Maps (GMaps).

AOI have been introduced in GMaps around mid 2016. They highlight places with the highest concentration of restaurants, shops and bars in an light orange style. In addition it is suspected that traffic of human activities/tracks as well as ratings of Points-of-Interest (POI) are other factors for the algorithm. However, it remains intransparent and non-reproducible how AOIs exactly are defined in GMaps.

This is where OSM makes a difference among others. We will explain and document the algorithm used in this work. Before all, some design decisions have had to be made: Our AOI concentrates on map visualizations on city and neighbourhood level and leaves buildings and POI as is at street level as part of the base map. We don't classify nor personalise the AOI to assumed information needs, like travelling, shopping or cultural entertainment, but respect all of them as POI.

In this work an AOI is defined as an "Urban area at city or neighbourhood level with a high concentration of POI, and typically located along a street of high spatial importance".

The first step of the algorithm is straight forward; it selects relevant POI and leaves out irrelevant ones, like e.g. commercial offices. Then - as simple as the definition sounds - it implies quite some challenges: The first issue is about efficiency and the second one about relevance. The spatial aggregation algorithm of POI and the related building outlines need to efficiently process massive data at worldwide level. As clustering algorithm we choose Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Then, this spatial aggregation outline is being mixed and aligned with streets of high spatial importance. For relevance calculation we used a network centrality algorithm. This centrality measure borrows from research on labelling hierarchies for street maps. From the results, our algorithms select aggregates that break a heuristically found threshold, and it labels them as AOI.

We will evaluate this algorithm to manually selected test areas. This contribution concludes with possible use cases, like tourist maps, and gives an outlook about further use cases, refinements and implementations of AOI.

okay hello everybody my name is Stefan

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,820
Keller from the University of Applied

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,600
Science rapperswil

00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:15,559
and that's on the other end of the lake

00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:19,669
of Zurich Switzerland and I want to talk

00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:24,009
about areas of interest and with some

00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:31,519
experience report of how to handle this

00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:33,680
in on a big planet scale the program or

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,399
the overview is about this I want to

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,980
define what our areas of interest what's

00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,460
the state of the arch and give you a

00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:46,519
definition how we defined area of areas

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,739
of interest I will then show you the

00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:51,800
implementation many of you are looking

00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:54,999
forward and how those are processed and

00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:58,579
then some remarks on further work and

00:00:54,999 --> 00:01:01,510
finally about what about big spatial

00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:05,570
data so first of all I just want to ask

00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:11,270
everybody who does know areas of

00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:13,760
interest on Google Maps so just to make

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,950
a proof how are they shown on the on the

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:21,890
map I mean on the mobile what's the

00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:26,290
color they say shaded orange then they

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:29,360
say it's very in the background and it

00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:32,870
they had a vague definition what it is

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,650
but so once again about about half a

00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:41,690
dozen or so no this kind of interesting

00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:45,350
additional information and the there are

00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,640
in fact several different notions behind

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,250
areas of interest

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,220
I mean Oh II there is a disambiguation

00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:56,330
page in Wikipedia that there is a

00:01:52,220 --> 00:02:00,350
Japanese girl group or ORS or something

00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:03,410
even and there are different in notions

00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:06,020
but in in computer assisted editing

00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,990
including humanitarian operations team

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,830
they define areas of interest so my

00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:16,700
first sentence the the focus area

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:19,580
where they expect to have buildings or

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,650
streets for example and areas where to

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,620
look at inside is the tasking manager

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,070
this is also kind of area of interest

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:32,300
because interest is a broad broad notion

00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:35,470
and a little bit more focused on the on

00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:38,360
topic is that in in tourism it's

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,990
shopping entertainment and cultural

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,520
areas polygons to help travelers to

00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,870
explore the world so if you visit

00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:52,550
first-time Milano Milan then you would

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:56,510
know where where to go and I mean this

00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:58,910
attendance is evening after and as an

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:03,410
alternative to the bellyfit area after

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:06,320
the the beer event or instead of so so

00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,750
that's what I want to show you and let's

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,630
take in my example I will take an

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,180
example of Milano at the quarter a

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:20,030
little bit between here and to the west

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:24,170
as an example of areas of interest so

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:27,190
this is how Google Maps looks like it's

00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:30,790
probably difficult to see from behind

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:35,000
because those orange shaded areas are

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:38,720
for example around here and and this is

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,989
more pink so then this is a building as

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,730
a shaded in area of interest and this is

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:49,190
not an area of interest and so you have

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:54,230
to look closer I mean perhaps you see it

00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:57,950
up here at Loreto and there was a two

00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:01,310
years ago blog post of Google technology

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:04,400
team Maps team they defined it simply

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:09,620
the places where there are there's a lot

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,870
of activities human activities and so

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,920
areas with the highest concentration of

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:18,830
restaurants bars and shops that's some

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:24,410
small citation out of their blog post

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:26,240
and in addition they they reported that

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,970
in high-density areas

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:34,160
New York City we are using a human touch

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:37,220
sounds good in my English non-english

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,610
ears they have some human intervention

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:44,240
and that was an on this blog post there

00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:47,750
are those shaded orange areas and it's a

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,930
single category comprising all touristic

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,389
activities which is something I want to

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:57,440
differentiate quite in the next slide

00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:58,069
and they are most probably using user

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,569
tracks

00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:07,370
I mean GPS tracks from their mobile

00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:10,880
applications Android phones where they

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,770
also derive information like opening

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,349
hours when or people entering a building

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,500
and and things like this so most

00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:20,930
probably and for all almost for sure

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,530
they are using also this kind of human

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:28,130
activities in addition to indicate if

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:31,310
there is area of interest note also that

00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:35,060
there are two kind of visualizations in

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:38,750
Google Maps one is building based I mean

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,909
once a building contains a shop or

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,539
something the whole building is shaded

00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:46,759
and that's building level how I call it

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:51,909
and when you zoom out to zoom level

00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:55,430
around 14 it gets some kind of aerial

00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:59,180
visualization polygonal polygons which

00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:02,259
is the kind of areas I'm looking for so

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:06,560
I'm looking at this aerial

00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:08,240
visualizations recently we find out we

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,180
found out that there is a start-up and I

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,080
startup from from Spain from Catalonia

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,210
called

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,780
a boxing.com they make a living off

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:22,610
selling areas of interest differentiated

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:24,710
between four or five categories they

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,550
defined as shopping sightseeing eating

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:30,889
night and nightlife and they have few

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:35,449
products around this there they sell to

00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:39,830
tourists ik organizations so they also

00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:41,900
did not tell the exactly

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:47,540
how they derive its that's part of the

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:52,060
start-up secret and but they say they

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:57,470
are collecting dozens of open data

00:06:52,060 --> 00:07:02,200
sources like most probably Flickr photos

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:05,330
and and other information instead of

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:08,300
human activity based on user tracks like

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:13,310
Google does they have a heat map and I

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:19,160
also have polygon data set which they

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:22,250
sell to the touristic users so that's

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:26,000
the same area all more or less where we

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:31,280
are here cheetah study and weather is

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:38,560
obviously some commercial area in this

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:41,840
in this region and this differs from

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,340
from category to category as they

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,950
differentiate and so here it is shown

00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:51,050
the shopping - shopping area which comes

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:55,460
close to the Google definition and my

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:57,920
own that's the other product from a boxy

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,520
they have in addition parks and

00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,910
waterfront as a separate category and it

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,610
looks also very similar so obviously

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:11,240
there are those commercial areas

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:16,070
according to their demo page which is

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:22,700
online finally there is also open trip

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:26,450
map which show shopping point of

00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:30,260
interests so sorry but only on a point

00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:31,730
so as a point level I mean only and

00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,090
that's on a point now that's not the

00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:38,210
thing I'm looking after I'm just

00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:41,720
mentioning it as to be complete more or

00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:46,820
less so my or our definition of areas

00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:49,130
interest is it's an urban area at city

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,950
or neighborhood level with a high

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,700
concentration of point of interests and

00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:57,330
typically located along

00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:01,110
a street of high spatial importance so

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:04,920
you see that I wanted to have something

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:07,560
like a Street notion in it and not only

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,670
some some kind of point of interest

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,740
concentration concentration we focus us

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,150
on neighborhood level not building level

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,860
as I said before and we are also just

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:22,800
aggregating all categories and putting

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,530
all into one not yet differentiating

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,210
between some categories which are

00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:32,310
difficult to to define anyhow so what's

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:36,060
the difference between eating and

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,670
shopping and things like this so it's

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,600
only one category to make it simple it's

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:46,050
based purely on over sleep map data and

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,630
it should be open documented it should

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,720
be reproducible and that's what I show

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,520
you now the implementation was part of a

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:59,160
master thesis of a computer science

00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:02,370
student who finished recently and it was

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,030
the goal was to explore the areas of

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:09,000
interest based on open source software

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:10,010
databases or Python and other tools if

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,930
needed

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:16,230
so the first that the overview of the

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:20,430
processing steps are like this get in

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:23,030
five or five steps step one filter the

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:26,030
point of interest out of OpenStreetMap

00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:30,420
containing a selected list of tags

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:35,750
cluster those point into polygons with a

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:40,230
clustering algorithm third create hulls

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:44,760
concave concave hulls around those

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:48,570
clusters and then fourth apply Network

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:53,460
centrality a linear notion to this kind

00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:56,130
of hull so based on the convex hull that

00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,530
is a polygon center and bay and from

00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,410
this Center we retrieved the street

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:04,770
network data the pedestrian street

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:07,230
network and calculated a so called

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:12,300
network centrality algorithm and

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:16,650
extended and and buffered these convex

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:21,000
hulls these hulls if needed in order to

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:23,700
somehow connect nearby clusters and

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,360
finally there is some cleanup like

00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:30,750
waterways and sanitizing so and that's

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,750
the whole current implementation so to

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:39,330
visualize those five steps once again

00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:42,600
based on Milano this region these are

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:45,740
the buildings containing the boys so of

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,450
course I not only are taking notes but

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:53,990
either there is a building with with

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:58,440
with a shop tag or some Museum or or or

00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:02,130
an other facilities all the or there is

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,320
a point inside a building so the

00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:08,790
building is shown as an area of interest

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:15,030
in in the first step then those

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:21,930
buildings are are clustered so one

00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:24,690
second oh these are the an an extract of

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,540
the tags we are using from OpenStreetMap

00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:31,220
just to be complete so if joining and an

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:37,050
idea which tags we filtered we retrieved

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:40,020
then the second step is there are there

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:45,270
is a convex hull building algorithm

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:48,270
round around those polygons and and for

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:50,460
this we used to post je s DB scan

00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:57,990
algorithm a well-known algorithm to

00:12:50,460 --> 00:13:03,510
cluster polygons and in this clustering

00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:05,760
defines some common areas and around

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,550
those areas which belong together I mean

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,060
those polygons which belong together

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:14,310
define an area and around this area

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:18,390
convex or concave hull is being

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:20,470
calculated which looks like this that's

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:25,360
the third step and the fourth

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:29,740
step then the linear notion comes in you

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,440
see in red the buffers and you see in

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,770
blue the Street Network and the

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:41,260
centrality algorithm defined important

00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:45,730
streets along and inside those polygons

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:51,520
and we allowed to buffer about 50 meters

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:57,010
to be outside those those hulls and

00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:59,800
finally we exclude water areas whether

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:04,180
or no water areas in Milan obviously so

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:06,700
I show you an example of Surak where the

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,180
city of Zurich where there is a lake and

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:14,500
and a river so we excluded in these

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:17,740
areas from the areas of interest and

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:23,070
unsanitized the whole thing which then

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:27,940
looks like this for the for milano and

00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:30,580
finally the result now visualized in

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:35,050
orange looks like this so that's the

00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:38,650
result and there is a home page showing

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:42,600
that kind which i just quickly show we

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,600
show you one one second

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:54,880
here I entered the coordinates of the

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:59,230
area of around where we are and in this

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:06,100
demonstration page you see the these

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:10,690
steps explained and one by one which I

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:14,130
explained just before which will end up

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:17,500
finally to these areas of interest

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:20,920
similar similar to the example shown

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:27,040
before that just a demonstration page

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:30,300
just as to explain what what really

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,900
happens to those who are interested and

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,690
the evil a evaluation showed

00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:40,470
that results are quite interesting I

00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:43,470
mean comparable more or less to do this

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:47,210
what Google shows so for example there

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:50,340
was a blog post from before by Justin

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:54,260
about Google Maps mode and how far ahead

00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:57,480
it is and that he said it's not only

00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:00,450
enough to collect data its own is also

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,480
needed to analyze it and here it is we

00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:07,860
also analyzed on steep map data and made

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,500
areas of interest out out of it and it

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:15,840
looks quite interesting and quite

00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:23,310
similar and further work is that for

00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:26,960
example terrycloth areas SQ 53 sorry 53

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:30,660
he want he used it to identify

00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:34,260
completeness as compared to a history in

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,300
this area of interest so then he's

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,670
interested in this kind of further use

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:44,070
of this of this data and we are still at

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:47,910
enhancing the parameters because even in

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:50,550
rural areas in touristic areas of

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:54,480
switzerland we we think it could be

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:57,800
better and of course we could also use

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,840
more input data like coordinates of

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,890
pictures it's implemented in Python

00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:08,459
using Postgres database and thus lower

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,400
part is the OS mnx which implemented the

00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,560
network centrality which is

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,410
unfortunately not available in post post

00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,720
GIS but it could be done that's the

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,840
slowest part is 10 times lower than the

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,320
older Aldi all the other calculations at

00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,800
least so and then there is a Jupiter

00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:32,130
Jupiter Jupiter a notebook which is a

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,710
publishing format which very much looks

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,290
like the visualization demo page I

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,510
showed you before but there you could

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:42,620
adapt parameters on yourself and

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:47,260
everything is deployed as a docker to be

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:50,260
to be installed in an easy way on

00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:53,470
your own so the resources you can

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:56,860
memorize which I also I published the

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,830
slides of course there is this demo page

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:03,340
which I don't want to broadcast too much

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:07,210
it's on a small computer and that I can

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:09,970
give you access to this hidden URL and

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,100
which is there in the public in fact

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:15,310
there is that there will be open source

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:18,010
and of the month when when the student

00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:20,890
is back from his well-deserved holidays

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:25,650
and there is this master's thesis to be

00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:28,240
published soon and as a plus I

00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:32,200
registered first time in my life a

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:36,730
digital object identifier and eternal an

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,880
eternal web resource URL similar to ISBN

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:43,300
for books to be referred in scientific

00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:50,440
papers it's a it's a DOI

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:52,960
at this data publishing repository now

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,950
just a few words i skipped those slides

00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:01,030
we repeated the same we already did in

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:06,400
post GIS and with python we repeat the

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:10,210
same by evaluating one of these apache

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:15,280
spark projects which dooper ization and

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:18,490
scale to be able to calculate the whole

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:22,780
thing of the whole planet in a few

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:26,530
minutes and we did not fine finish this

00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:30,240
work because we would we would have had

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:32,740
more time to implement DB scan and

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:37,230
network centrality algorithm which is

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:39,520
not available and in inside those

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:43,060
packages and that's the short message

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,360
about the the real paralyzed big data

00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:49,510
the message is I skip this one lessons

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,510
learned or the available tools with

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:56,980
protests or rock-solid it allowed us to

00:19:52,510 --> 00:20:00,430
use sophisticated functions like DP scan

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,179
for example or St Union and things like

00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,269
this

00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:06,969
the approach is still very young to

00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:11,229
pearlized the whole stuff but it's much

00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:16,769
more expensive and time-consuming to

00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:21,369
implement the that kind of scaled up

00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:25,299
infrastructure so I'm coming I'm just

00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:27,309
I'm fast on this I know we didn't finish

00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:29,609
this implementation but it was

00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:32,799
interesting for us to evaluate

00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:36,759
alternative to post yes and we did not

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:39,149
find any at least not as oh we are still

00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:43,210
using post areas even for the planet and

00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:46,269
we take the time to wait a little bit

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:48,070
longer until Postgres has finished its

00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:50,589
implementations because it would take

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:55,589
much more time to implement all those

00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:55,589
algorithms already available in post GIS

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:03,309
so I will finish and at the door to

00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:07,450
thank the this master thesis and the

00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:10,330
student also to the team of my lab to an

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:13,570
intern from Singapore who also helped to

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:17,109
analyze and reverse-engineer Google

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:20,859
Google's implementation and cherry cloth

00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,910
famous mapper from the UK thank you very

00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:25,029
much thank you Stefan

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,029
[Applause]

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,190
[Music]

00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:31,739
so a little bit more time for questions

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:50,129
because we can finish at 3:30 for coffee

00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:52,440
so first question at the very back hi I

00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:56,100
was just wondering do you have a like a

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,470
compiled list of tags you use that

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:02,759
determine whether or not something

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:05,190
something to Aoi or some tags a compiled

00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:09,330
list of the tag I use of course of

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:13,609
course that's part of this webpage I

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:18,269
will show you so if I start over the

00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:21,179
calculation you'll see this is the list

00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:23,249
the complete list of tags that's what

00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,269
you are asking for yep that's the list

00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:28,649
okay cool

00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:31,200
I mean in the implementation in the

00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:33,450
repository in the github repository in

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,700
the open source it will be in your pores

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:40,460
where you see it in the source thank you

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,859
for the presentation

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:48,509
what's the processing time finally when

00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:51,480
you are only using post GIS if you said

00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:55,019
you wanted to go distributed with spark

00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:59,279
to go a few minutes computation but I

00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:04,080
didn't get how long it was with just a

00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:07,739
relational database framework so you see

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:11,340
now an area of city of Zurich which is

00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:14,249
not a big area around zoom level 14 now

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,440
I push the button and it will take some

00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:18,779
minutes over you can observe so it's

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,279
some minutes for an area of few

00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:25,409
kilometers it's around half an hour for

00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:28,139
Switzerland and expert an except for

00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:31,470
whole Switzerland and extrapolating this

00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:36,899
to the tour the whole world would mean I

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:39,059
said I would say a few hours yeah so

00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:44,490
it's about one hour story for speed

00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:47,399
and about 45 minutes is just the network

00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:50,429
centrality algorithms and only 50

00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:56,429
minutes all the processing within post

00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:59,340
GIS 400 cellent I think the result of

00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:00,899
this is set of polygons or kind of data

00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,139
set what you can use for visualization

00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:08,129
or analysis of locations that's a idea

00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:10,799
my question is this algorithms would say

00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:13,350
work even in the client-side I mean I'm

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,720
I already have my vector tiles for

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:19,019
example with the data on the browser so

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,850
cool this kind of three steps be done in

00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:26,279
vector tile level dynamically live in

00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:30,360
renderer in mobile browser or web

00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:33,210
browser CC algorithms don't require

00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:37,350
really global data's local tiles already

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:39,899
have everything what you need it's

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:43,230
available as Jo Jason as there are

00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:46,559
simply polygons and the server cycles

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,869
can be tiled vector tiles yes the data

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,539
processed and in server-side the problem

00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:53,279
is that if you process it it will be

00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,559
outdated right in the moment when you

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,019
are starting to use but if you have

00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:00,570
theoretical at least lie by vector tiles

00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:02,789
you don't need to transfer anything to

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,499
the client extra or process anything on

00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:07,080
the server it just takes the same

00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:09,509
algorithms implement in JavaScript with

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,419
vector tiles you have the point of

00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:15,809
interest data there already and do it

00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:18,119
live on JavaScript level in client what

00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:20,070
have you considered this scenario all

00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:23,580
this algorithms would say in principle

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:28,139
work in very local geographically local

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:31,860
level with a with a browser it could be

00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:34,679
done on the fly yes but then you would

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,350
need a whole you know the pite and all

00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,090
the dependencies you know you would need

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,899
post yes which is probably already there

00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:45,539
but you would need also this OS mmm X

00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:48,119
library and all these dependencies yes

00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:49,860
you could but you will need to

00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:50,820
re-implement everything in JavaScript

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,860
that I wouldn't do that

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,179
no I will

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:59,120
to that if you zoom out it would request

00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:01,820
whole Europe and that would take on four

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,559
hours even on the fastest well you don't

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,570
have points of interest in Europe and

00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,670
level and vector tiles anyway so this

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,740
kind of level that disappears but yes

00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,830
circles can be this kind of scalability

00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,020
issues and this live live implementation

00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,610
of that but yeah yeah if I wilt I'm

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:21,770
thinking this data that's kind of

00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:24,260
rendering help or kind of visualization

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,870
technique of points really so it's

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,480
called pay done and in principle in okay

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,309
implant but in an infected amount is all

00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,179
coming from environmental planners and

00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:37,809
and allocation location allocation

00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:40,280
analysis so I try another time here and

00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:42,049
they are they don't care about changes

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,200
lost the last few weeks they are they

00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:48,320
are just interested in where our areas

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:52,010
of hi shopping activities and they are

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:55,490
using this as another input to decide on

00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:58,610
a new location and and for example and

00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,650
also for touristic purposes it is not

00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:12,730
and as they don't see a need yet to be

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:12,730
really that up-to-date okay yeah

00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:21,270
yeah thanks for your talk to chef on

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,750
Google had another approach than you

00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:29,250
would OpenStreetMap did you compare the

00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:32,250
two if there are some laughs yes as I

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:34,350
said before first we we looked at Google

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:37,470
and tried to find out what how they are

00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:40,410
outdated and then and then I added a

00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:43,460
small ad hoc research to get with

00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:47,190
terrycloth where he looked at New York

00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,810
compared to this blog post and it looked

00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,570
it there are differences and it's

00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:56,340
interesting that also Google sometime is

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:59,100
wrong when it attacked a Swiss bank back

00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,260
office area a large area of area of

00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:05,520
interest but it's also only a back

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:08,010
office area and probably my algorithm is

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,460
a little bit too optimistic and little

00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:13,950
bit wrong in the rural touristic areas

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,110
in the smaller ones so we have to adapt

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:21,180
the parameters for example of the DB

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:22,350
scan algorithm in the beginning of the

00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,630
process you have five different

00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:27,180
categories of your eyes and after that

00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:29,670
frankly you merged them but do you keep

00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,830
the initial information for whoever

00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:35,030
would be interested to see the

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:39,740
interactions between the five categories

00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:45,000
once again the five categories you have

00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:46,530
defining the different aoi's yes and did

00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,320
you keep the information during the

00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:51,840
process for whoever would be interested

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:56,280
- tuinal I the interaction between these

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:59,820
categories I I'm not sure if I

00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:04,380
understand you correctly because when

00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:08,250
you look at these tags I directly take

00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,980
these awesome tags and and use all those

00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:14,280
and I did not make a mapping also I

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:18,060
already have made some some experiments

00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,820
to relate those to sightseeing or to

00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:23,490
shopping so so I could make this

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:27,120
relationship but I did not yet because

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,450
in the the next maps you have different

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,690
colors

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:34,840
please when it was not me me who

00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:39,730
differentiated it it was a boxy no no no

00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:44,200
after that yes and next one

00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:47,140
exactly which previous one the previous

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:51,760
one with your colors the party in here

00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:55,530
you have different kind of Aoi's colors

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,810
just indicate that I mean that there are

00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:00,940
clusters and the color just indicates

00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:04,420
that close to one two three four there

00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:07,270
are random colors or just it's one

00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:10,450
category and an ante visualization just

00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:12,340
show has chosen a random color for each

00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,040
different cluster okay there's no

00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:17,590
different

00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:20,670
it's just making the visual to visualize

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:22,810
the difference between each instance

00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,720
okay we're going to have a cloth that is

00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:27,640
definitely an area of interest is topic

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,200
so thank you for your attention and

00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,980
around of applause for all of the

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:36,339
speakers

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:36,339
