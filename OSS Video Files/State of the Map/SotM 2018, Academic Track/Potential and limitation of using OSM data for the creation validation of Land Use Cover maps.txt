OpenStreetMap (OSM) provides a large amount of valuable data in many parts of the world, that is foreseen to increase, becoming even more useful, especially for the regions where it is most needed. The richness of OSM data is associated to the hundreds of pairs key/value identified in the OSM Map Features Wiki and the additional ones volunteers may create. The OSM Map Features include the keys "Landuse", "Natural" and "Waterway", which are particularly useful to extract Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) information. However, it is also possible to extract additional and more complete LULC data from many other features, which may be used for 1) the creation of LULC maps [1] ; 2) to validate LULC maps [2]; 3) to train classifiers to classify satellite imagery [3], or 4) to create hybrid products, adding information extracted from OSM to enrich existing LULC maps [4]. However, several problems and limitation for this use of OSM can be identified. Among these are: 1) the existence of key/values not listed in the OSM feature map wiki, raising problems to the development of automated approaches; 2) the difficulties in associating some key/values to only one LULC class; 3) the overlap of features associated to different LULC classes. These difficulties will be highlighted in this presentation, and suggestions of approaches to, if not solve, at least decrease the importance of some of these factors. These include the development of methodologies to extract additional information from the data available, but also the inclusion of possible additional features in the OSM data collecting protocol.

okay so my topic is about the use of

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,269
OpenStreetMap or SEM for the creation

00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,870
and validation of land use and land

00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:19,060
cover maps so I will make a small

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:22,839
introduction on the topic and then the

00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,909
ways we can use our same for creating or

00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:28,269
helping to create land use and land

00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:30,789
cover maps mainly converting for

00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:32,890
validation in for training and some

00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:36,550
conclusions opportunities limitations

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:39,580
and so on so the time is short so for

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,290
the introduction I'm not sure how

00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,690
familiar if there are someone who is not

00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,060
familiar what with what is a land use

00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,310
land cover map so basically there are

00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,220
maps where you have classes of land use

00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:54,880
or land cover like urban fabric forest

00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,860
or agriculture water and these maps are

00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,220
important for environmental studies for

00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,800
example land cover change usually they

00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,049
are created using satellite imagery you

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,869
use classifiers some types of

00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:10,390
classifiers require training data so you

00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:12,369
need to know where our region's which

00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,350
correspond to each of the classes and

00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:16,630
then you run the classifiers you have a

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,429
map and that map needs to be validated

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:27,490
afterwards so here in the main the main

00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:32,139
aim of these projects we have going on

00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,729
is to add value to vgi so volunteer

00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:37,590
geographic information in general not

00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:40,329
only osm by processing the existing data

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,420
integrating diverse several sources of

00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:48,459
data all this started with the cost

00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:55,649
actions which ended in 2016 so there are

00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:59,310
several people involved in this and so

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:02,499
when we started working the aim was not

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,200
awesome but it was one teacher graphic

00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:07,719
information so information created by

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,270
volunteers that has location like

00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:15,160
panorama photos Flickr Twitter u2 and so

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:17,020
on so many types of data projects

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,550
with very different objectives and so

00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:26,320
they may have a usefulness let's say for

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:29,380
diverse objectives in order to many

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,820
amounts of data and some of them can be

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:38,350
downloaded so one of them of course is

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:43,270
OS m and the potential is very large and

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:45,910
so we started to analyze how could we

00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:52,000
use OS m for land use land cover map

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:54,430
creation and or validation so this is

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,310
what I was saying before so the creation

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,570
of production of land cover maps

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,730
classifications of images you need

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,980
training data and then for this

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,460
assessment the accuracy of the final

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:09,730
product you need reference data so data

00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:15,070
that you know it's correct that you

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:20,770
compare with the created mapper map and

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:26,080
so OS m may assist both in the creation

00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:28,480
and the validation by three main ways a

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,610
direct creation of a land use land cover

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:36,160
map from the data that is available SM

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:40,030
by creating reference data sets that can

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,580
be used to validate maps and by jury

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,580
generating data sets that can be used to

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,670
train the classifiers

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,680
what are what why wise use or SM and not

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:54,160
just do it the way it is usually done

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,640
the thing is speed because if you create

00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,040
the reference dataset by hand you may

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,200
have need to have field visits you need

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,760
to make photo interpretation it takes

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:11,320
time it costs money it needs experts and

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:14,170
and one important aspect is that with

00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,080
the amount of satellite imagery that is

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:20,049
being available more often and more

00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,760
often you need to automate processes so

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:25,600
if you if you need to do some things

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,970
manually it takes time and when you have

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,139
a map created and validated you all have

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,999
already have self

00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:35,830
images that were available so you need

00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:38,229
to automate processes so the aim is to

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,830
get osm data and create something like

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:40,840
this

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:45,279
oh and use land cover maps with some

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,469
classes so we were developing a web

00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,749
application we are developing which

00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:55,300
converts automatically what is available

00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:58,169
in iOS m2o and use land cover map for

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,300
example so we have lots of data there

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:05,080
you all are familiar of course with OS m

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,479
we have these map features what we have

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,960
to do to go to all those map features

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,879
and see which and how they can be

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,659
associated to the land use land cover

00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:20,050
classes that we are interested in so we

00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:22,659
went to these wiki with map features and

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:26,139
went to which one of them and see how

00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:30,009
you can assign it to a land use or land

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:32,889
cover class so there is a description of

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:37,479
the process we have created so there are

00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:40,360
several people involved in this for fast

00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:42,550
explanation so basically we need to

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,490
choose the classes which we call the

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:48,729
nomenclature and then we get osm data

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:51,879
you this needs to be done manually so we

00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:53,529
need to identify from osm data what we

00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,839
can assign to each one of the classes

00:05:53,529 --> 00:06:00,580
and then we have this conversion process

00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:03,149
which have several tools inside it we

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:07,180
need some parameters some of them can be

00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:10,839
created by users others can some default

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:13,810
parameters are also there so we the

00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:16,360
output of this process is our polygons

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,189
assigned to these classes and then there

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,289
are inconsistencies because there will

00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:22,830
be overlapping polygons three different

00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:25,750
classes so we have to eliminate

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,330
inconsistencies because in a land cover

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:32,069
map you have only one class in each

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:34,379
location so you get after these

00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:37,149
elimination every consistencies

00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:39,669
non-overlapping polygons and then there

00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:41,460
is this generalization process which we

00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:44,340
did not do yet this

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,130
you means minimum mapping unit because

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,800
some of some maps of land land cover and

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,020
land use have this minimum mapping unit

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,240
and if we want to compare what we are

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,550
getting here with those maps we should

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,090
apply some generalization procedures we

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,819
did not apply them yet

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:05,669
so the nomenclatures we have used so far

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:11,340
is an urban atlas nomenclature

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:13,770
it has 12 somatic classes actually the

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,570
last version has more classes I'll show

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,520
it in a minute

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,680
it's not available for all Europe it

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,210
only for the main cities with more

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,729
inhabitants we also analyzed or

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:30,050
converted to Corinne land covered Noma

00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:34,050
culture here we have 44 thematic classes

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:37,440
and also for global and 30 which is a

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:40,889
map produced so it's a global map by the

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,199
National geometric center of China from

00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:45,840
a Landsat imagery it has a special

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,960
resolution of 30 meters and it has only

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,139
sent 10 somatic classes so this is an

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,449
example not an example it's real the

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,199
nomenclature of urban art was the one

00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:01,469
from 2006 the one from 2012 has already

00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:05,219
a few more classes so it has more

00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:08,099
classes in 11th level 2 4 for example a

00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:10,590
free culture it has also a class called

00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:14,370
wetlands and this is the Korean land

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:17,669
cover classes so we did not make the

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:20,460
conversion to the 3 levels so basically

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:23,520
we did not make over to the 3rd level

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,280
because it's very hard to assign what is

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,070
in osm to all these classes so we have

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,510
it mainly for first level and second

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:35,130
level even though in some cases we use

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:38,969
features that actually would correspond

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,770
to level 3 in both of them the global

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:44,640
and 30 know main culture so it has only

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:46,170
10 classes which is much less classes

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,370
and it's much easier to make the

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:53,760
conversion this is an example of the

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,760
process for only one class so what we

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,220
need to get

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,650
for example these classes class 1.2 in

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,990
urban Atlas it corresponds to industry

00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:04,480
commercial public military private

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:08,290
interpretation units so we need to go to

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,290
OS m and extract everything that may

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,970
contribute to this class either polygons

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,300
or for example here you have

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:18,010
communication units which are lines we

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,250
need to convert those lines to regions

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:25,060
so we developed an algorithm took to a

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,620
yes automatically the widths of roads so

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,530
that they don't overlap buildings for

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,480
example afterwards so do you put

00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:34,270
everything together extract what you

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,230
have to extract when you have lines you

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,630
have to create those buffers and then

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,250
you merge everything and you get the

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,030
class okay

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:51,340
I will just this is an automatic process

00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:52,870
now I can so we are creating a portal

00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,290
where we have several tools to export

00:09:52,870 --> 00:10:03,790
PGI I can show it very fast

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:09,070
let me just it's not yet available I

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:11,200
have so this is volunteer work because

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:14,410
we have real no funding so we are

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:20,340
basically doing this in spare time so

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:20,340
for example here we go and choose Milani

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:30,400
let's make it a small area so that it is

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:36,760
fast we draw an interest area we

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:38,830
download the data from our Sam and now

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:45,030
we run the position let's make it for

00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:48,430
urban artists for example and we get a

00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:50,680
land government okay here it's in raster

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,420
because it needs to be fast because if

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,000
it would be in vector you have to wait

00:10:52,420 --> 00:11:01,240
only more time the aim is to make it

00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:05,520
available in vector ok so let's go back

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,520
to the presentation

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:17,660
okay so this is examples what's

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,210
represented here so you have the urban

00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:25,040
oculus map the official one this is from

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:27,440
2006 this is a region of London and

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,220
actually so this is urban artists level

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,260
2 and level 1 in this is what the result

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,530
of the conversion from OpenStreetMap

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:39,620
data to the seminal men culture for

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,130
level 2 and for level 1 there is one

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,260
thing

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:44,300
so here you see the difference is

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,810
because of course these maps take time

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,540
to produce and so they are already out

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,610
of date so and here you can see these

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,270
were stadium built for the Olympic Games

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,340
which were not in the official Maps and

00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:00,260
here we could already see them and this

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,780
is the same but to the Korean land cover

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,330
so you see the minimum mapping unit of

00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,760
Korean it it's it's much different from

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,500
here and so here we need a

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,250
generalization process so that you can

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,610
compare so this is the same for this

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:20,300
region which is more rural less less

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:23,510
urban of course when we convert it we

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,070
have empty areas where you do not have

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:28,430
that you know SM you get nothing so

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:30,590
there is a hole in our map and there are

00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,240
problems so I we don't have time to

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:37,280
explain that if you want afterwards I

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,440
can explain so we need then this is to

00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,050
compare what is develop in Europe so

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,030
Europe we have many maps but in some

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,920
parts of all there are no Maps no land

00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:49,310
use land cover maps except the global

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:53,890
ones which have low resolution so these

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:56,300
was a work we did with global and 30

00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:59,300
which is available so apply the to

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,270
Katmandu weather is osm data this is the

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:06,260
original global 30 this is the result of

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:08,540
the conversion and this is the updated

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,610
let's say we call it updated the thing

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:15,350
is that where you do not have that you

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:17,690
get empty space so we assigned to the

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,260
empty space what was develop in the

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,600
original

00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,520
thirty it's a hybrid product that has

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,950
problems of course because you have

00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,590
different timings and so on but when you

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:32,510
do not have much more data it may be

00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:35,810
useful and what we did afterwards is

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,300
that as we have more detail in in osm we

00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,370
can use more detail in some classes like

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,680
in the urban classes so instead of

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:47,870
saying just urban like we did here

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:51,500
artificial surfaces in red here we could

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:56,080
separate between urban fabric and then

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,080
the commercial and so on this this class

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:06,740
okay this is the same from Dar es Salaam

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:09,770
here there are problematic classes it's

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,920
not clear here but for example we get

00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:17,540
here these big regions with water which

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,460
actually were classified as wetlands but

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,590
there is no water there there are

00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,930
buildings inside those regions the thing

00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,900
is that probably someone classified

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,420
flooding areas as wetlands and so when

00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,210
we go and pick up wetlands as regions

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:38,570
with water we get mistakes so there is

00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:41,660
one limitation okay it's for assessing

00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:47,600
how we can use or if we can use osm for

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:49,210
validation the thing so possible first

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,590
thing we can make a direct comparison

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:53,510
the thing is that for validation you

00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:57,970
need to have what we call ground truth

00:14:53,510 --> 00:15:00,740
real good data or we can use a sample of

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,570
data so if you have a whole map you can

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,970
make large comparisons if we don't we

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,940
can't get a sample in compare Maps

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:11,300
innocent and in that sample of course

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:13,870
there are rules to make the samples in

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,460
this paper what we did we created a

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:20,210
random sample to make some comparisons

00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:23,420
also and with direct comparison in the

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:25,400
end with the sample we made one way to

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,560
create the reference that was by photo

00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,500
interpretation in the another way was

00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,740
extracting data from osm and where there

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,980
was no doubt that we used

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:39,540
to interpretation and then compare the

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:42,720
accuracy so this is turbine atlas so to

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,490
test these we assess the accuracy of

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,890
urban artists just to see how it worked

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,920
so this is urban atlas this is the

00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:53,220
extracted from the the go and use land

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,810
cover the OSM and this is the regions

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,150
where there are various agreement which

00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,770
is most of it there are some parts where

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,930
there is no agreement so you have one

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:05,790
class here and another one there of

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:07,470
course I have one level too of course

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:11,550
when you get to more detail you have

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:14,100
less regions that are in accordance in

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,540
both so there is less agreement okay

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,170
there are some numbers here there are

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,450
regions the thing is that to do these

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,290
it's tricky because the regions where

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:27,030
you do not have that in OSM are not

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:30,750
split in the same way but by all classes

00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:33,210
so you have a bias in the comparison for

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,610
example there are here you have more

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:38,160
regions that were not classified in this

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:46,140
class than the others so this is tricky

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:49,490
to get meaningful results so to get rid

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:53,310
of this we created also this sample the

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:55,530
blue points represent the sample where

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,140
there was that in osm we extracted that

00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:00,360
were from OSM where there wasn't for

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:04,320
example in here we used photo

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:08,640
interpretation the results show a high

00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:11,460
agreement so this is result comparing

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,260
all urban otto's with with the sample

00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,470
create a bit photo interpretations here

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,270
with osm and photo interpretation do you

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,090
see it for level one the results are

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:23,100
almost the same for level two you get a

00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,980
little more problems for example this

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,760
class here with the users accuracy was

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,430
much lower

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,170
so there are problematic classes but

00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:35,430
whatever one actually the thing worked

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:39,360
quite well for these regions so third

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:42,210
way of using OSM training okay so

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,520
basically there are two ways to do it

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,380
you get all that

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,540
sign to classes and use it auto training

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,660
so some colleagues of ours already

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:54,990
tested that the thing is that if you

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:58,400
have wrong regions wrongly classified

00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:00,120
you get problems in the classification

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,000
another approach

00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,130
it's to select regions from osm which

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,700
are more reliable and then use those

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:11,310
only those for training so we are now I

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,680
do not have results we are in the middle

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:17,810
of the process of finishing some results

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:21,140
with this second first and second also

00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:23,280
so basically we used

00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,860
NDVI so we normalized difference

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,280
vegetation index where we can identify

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,500
in image what is vegetation what is not

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,470
and for example if you have a region

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,630
that is according to the NDVI vegetation

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,840
in that region is inside the region

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,970
classified as urban you don't use it for

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,710
training because you have plants they do

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,960
not have buildings and the other way

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,420
around if you have an NDVI which this

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,250
correspond not to vegetation and that is

00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,580
used for classification of vegetation

00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:57,000
you just leave it out and don't use it

00:18:52,580 --> 00:19:01,170
another way is to identify process to

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,770
get exclude regions which can be

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:08,280
assigned to more than one class so you

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:10,290
already tested some of these and also

00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,880
instead of using everything just select

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:19,290
some regions and the results are

00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:21,030
promising in some cases the accuracy is

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,310
very similar to the accuracy you get

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:27,450
when you make the the manual selection

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:31,080
of training areas and it depends a lot

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,400
on the Roman culture because if you have

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,010
know many cultures which do not

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:40,980
correspond very well without what you

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:43,590
know s/m you get problems ok so why to

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,280
do this I already said the name is

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:51,690
automate the most that you can it's

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,880
faster is cheaper and allow you to have

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:57,450
more current Maps because you can do it

00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,740
very fast and also

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,230
facilitate the creation of

00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,700
high-resolution maps for example in the

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,420
regions where there are they are not

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,430
available

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,430
like the regions where you just have for

00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:13,050
example global and 30 and you need a map

00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:15,150
with more resolution so osm is very good

00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,820
for this because it has a lots of data

00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,710
low cost dynamic you have local

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,990
knowledge which is also important for

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:25,320
this and the main problems that some

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,330
places you have no data and so the

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,370
doctor quality is always a problem

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:33,060
because we never film to validate or

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:36,060
train you need good data not not that

00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:39,600
which are then creating problems in the

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,740
process that 8 rigidity in some regions

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,960
there are very well map

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,930
others are not some features are missing

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,790
in other place in some places and also

00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:50,130
inconsistencies because sometimes you

00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:52,200
have polygons overlapping corresponding

00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,180
to different classes and you have to

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,640
figure out what to do with it for

00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,100
example if you have a bridge over water

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,730
you'll get both classes in that region

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,410
you have to choose one usually we choose

00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:08,430
the bridge of the bridge it's not called

00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:10,770
with it's a highway for example but it

00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,690
can be a tunnel so if you choose the

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,660
bridge if you you may have a tunnel

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:19,020
under the water it can happen so this is

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,750
a problem future work so we are

00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,960
improving the the process of convert the

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:28,500
conversion keep working on extraction

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,310
only a reliable data integration several

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:35,430
sources of data and I have been mainly

00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:39,210
involved in extracting data we also want

00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:41,880
to contribute to the data so we are ok

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:44,490
so mapping party is youth may a person

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,120
from University so I'm starting on these

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:50,310
and if you can help me right so many

00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,390
opportunities many challenges definitely

00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,390
and thank you

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:03,789
thank you very much satalia now we do

00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:05,619
have some very very few important

00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:08,739
questions left because the next

00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:14,879
presentation should be on time which has

00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:14,879
the special setting any questions yes

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,129
what sort of classifiers are you

00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:27,609
training on the data we already tested

00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:29,799
several we used maximum likelihood in

00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:31,749
these last two tests we use maximum

00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:35,950
likelihood but we also already used

00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:38,369
fuzzy classifiers we can test several

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,369
