In recent years, the academic research community have conducted various types of research into trying to understand the motivations, profiles and personalities of contributors to OpenStreetMap (OSM). This research is often completely quantitative - usually by considering ONLY the edits and interactions with the OSM database itself. In August 2017, after some discussion with the OSM community via mailing lists and blog posts, an online demographic survey [1] of OSM contributors was launched with the aim of understanding the impacts of user demographics on the data itself by linking these indicators to their editing behaviours. Over a four week period the survey garnered 326 responses which, given the advertising and dissemination strategies, constituted a low response rate.

During SOTM 2018, to both acknowledge the valuable contribution made by the users as well as demonstrate the potential of the community as a resource for understanding the deeper dynamics of OSM, we want to share the survey results with the OSM community. As well as updating quantitative estimates about the demographic profiles of OSM contributors (about which relatively little is known) we believe the survey contributes to the collective empirical knowledge about OSM contributors.

As well as these results, this paper will share some qualitative insights of working with and learning from the OSM community in this context. Topics will include the nature and role of mailing lists and their administrators; maintaining user anonymity in OSM; and mitigating language barriers for maximum inclusion. Through sharing our experience of these issues, it is hoped that during our paper presentation we can initiate a collaborative discussion about best practice in learning from OSM contributors themselves, as well as developing strategies to positively engage and develop a productive dialogue with OSM contributors for the benefit of both the scientific and OSM contributor communities. This will hopefully result in an ongoing dialogue post-conference focussed on how to improve academic engagement with the OSM user community. In these dialogues the potential further exploration of OSM as source of quantitative as well as rich qualitative data on its contributors will be discussed.

I'm Sarah Gardner as Marco said I'm from

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,430
the Nottingham geospatial Institute at

00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:15,539
the University of Nottingham and today I

00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,349
just want to share some of my

00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,859
experiences some of the things I've

00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:24,579
learned about I'm just going to have

00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:29,699
this hope doesn't say I know some of the

00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:33,430
things I've learned from surveying the

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,770
OpenStreetMap community which I did last

00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:39,100
year for a wider study looking at the

00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:41,650
impacts of demographic biases on actual

00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,200
OpenStreetMap edits so I think this kind

00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,760
of leads on quite nicely from what Peter

00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,600
and and used have just been talking

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,150
about and I'm just trying to take some

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,380
of those boxes on that seven step

00:00:52,150 --> 00:01:00,880
process that that may key Hackley stated

00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:02,770
at the previous conference so just to

00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,629
give you some brief background to my

00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:08,649
current research interests and the

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:10,689
survey that I conducted last year it was

00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:14,439
really developed as a response to the

00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:17,859
male participation bias which has been

00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:22,659
measured around 92 to 95 percent by

00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:24,670
various earlier studies but there's been

00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:27,880
very little emphasis on the actual

00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:30,819
impacts of that participation bias on

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,729
the data that's actually produced only a

00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:36,100
kind of theoretical critiques that the

00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:38,560
interests of certain cohorts of the

00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,630
population predominantly women are being

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,520
left off the map as a direct result of

00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:48,130
the bias so what I'm attempting to do

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,859
with this ongoing work is to identify

00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,679
some real impacts of the bias by linking

00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:58,420
actual edits to the demographics as

00:01:53,679 --> 00:02:02,529
volunteered by the sample of my kind of

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:05,109
survey sample and because OpenStreetMap

00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:07,179
users are not required to provide any

00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,460
demographic data or any any personal

00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:11,650
details at all this had to be done

00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,709
firstly by surveying the community and

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,549
asking them directly for their

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:20,760
demographics so the first thing I'm

00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:23,400
going to do is just talk through how we

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,680
went about surveying the crowd and the

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,480
OpenStreetMap population I'll then give

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,579
you some break results of the breakdown

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,180
of the structure of the sample

00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:35,670
population from the people that actually

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,920
replied to the survey and then I'll end

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,829
with some more qualitative reflections

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,480
on how the community responded to the

00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:50,519
survey and what their reaction was to

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:55,290
being surveyed so this is the process

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:57,780
that we went through in consultation

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,629
with other researchers there was concern

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,120
about survey fatigue amongst the

00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:05,939
community so it was important to try and

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,200
get the community onside prior to learnt

00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:13,109
launching the survey to try and ensure a

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,530
maximum response rate so the first thing

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:20,519
to do in this was to introduce myself

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,489
and my research and I am guilty of some

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:28,440
of those sins unfortunately as I have no

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:31,669
edits on OpenStreetMap at all so I you

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,680
know I'm very naive about that process

00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:37,620
so the first thing to do as I say was to

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,680
try and introduce my agenda and myself

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,909
as a researcher so the first thing I did

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,479
which some of you may have have seen was

00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:50,819
to publish a here's the diary on

00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,939
OpenStreetMap user Diaries and I did

00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:59,430
that on the 20th of July to expire to

00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:01,769
the launch and then two weeks later I

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,530
actually launched the survey itself

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:08,280
through Bristol online surveys which is

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:12,419
a free survey tool available at least to

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:17,280
UK academics I'm not quite sure whether

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:20,729
it's open to other non UK academics and

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,159
I disseminated the notification and the

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:27,280
signposting to the survey again via the

00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:30,520
user Diaries and then also through

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,680
english-language OpenStreetMap mailing

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:37,570
lists and I'll talk a little bit about

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,580
mailing lists in a minute so that was

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:43,710
launched on the 3rd of August

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:46,750
four weeks after that I sent a further

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:49,030
signpost further notification as so they

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:53,290
were still open again through the user

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:59,320
Diaries I also sent a personal Facebook

00:04:53,290 --> 00:05:01,960
the post around and that was four weeks

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,420
after the launch and the survey was open

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,610
for another four weeks from there and

00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,490
just to talk a little bit about the

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:14,160
survey design itself it was very short

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:17,580
very brief only six questions to request

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,220
demographic indicators gender age

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,600
educational background location and

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:29,440
nationality and then critically what

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,150
many OpenStreetMap users kindly

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,830
volunteered was they use the name and

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,950
this was the vital bit of information

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,980
that I needed to carry out the analysis

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:43,180
in order to look at the direct impacts

00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,800
of the of the demographics on the actual

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:52,150
edits themselves so without that

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:54,970
information there was no study I also

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,700
incentivize that process by offering the

00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,720
60 Amazon a prize draw for six years on

00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:05,820
vouchers so I'm just going to talk a

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,820
little bit about them the mailing lists

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,740
because these are quite key to in my

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,900
comment earlier I talked about actually

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,610
reaching the community and accessing the

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,139
community so people can actually see

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:25,100
what you're doing and that the surveys

00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:26,930
are are they're available and perhaps

00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,000
people aren't actually seeing that I

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,380
don't know so that might be something

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,280
that we need to think about how we

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:39,350
disseminate this information so the

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:41,360
first aspect of the mailing list is that

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,700
you have to sign up to it to be able to

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,100
contribute to it so that has to be

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,930
validated or verified both by a mailing

00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,270
list administrator so you have to kind

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,630
of get through that barrier first so I

00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:59,980
had to do that with five different

00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:03,020
english-language mailing lists secondly

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,940
we just don't know how many people were

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,160
reaching through that process because

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,389
there's no I did request this

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,300
information but there's no information

00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:13,040
about know openly accessible information

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,200
about how many people are actually on

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,150
those mailing lists and also with the

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,130
user Diaries we just don't know how many

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,250
people are actually reading that so I

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,290
have no idea how many people knew that

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,260
the survey was going on and how many

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:32,960
people these signposts and notifications

00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:36,530
were actually reaching thirdly there are

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,560
a lot of mailing lists and how do we

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:43,460
choose which ones are valuable as routes

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,190
of dissemination and perhaps that come

00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:49,060
science mailing list might be something

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:52,250
that's going to work in the future

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,650
and which ones might create sampling

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,680
errors so which ones might be more

00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:01,610
likely to create self-selecting in terms

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:05,000
of people volunteering to to participate

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,760
in the surveys and then lastly about the

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,500
language barriers

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:13,640
I'm told that English is the de facto

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,550
language of OpenStreetMap which is why I

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,199
used English language speaking mailing

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,730
lists to disseminate the survey

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,340
but is it worth attempting to send

00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:26,370
English correspondence via non --is--

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,169
English speaking mailing lists and how

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,070
many people are we actually excluding

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:34,229
from the process with only disseminating

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,690
this stuff in English a minimal you

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:38,610
can't possibly translate everything into

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,099
all the languages it's the global

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:46,740
project but it's just something to

00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:49,710
consider so I'm just going to go through

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,600
the response rate now so over the

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,890
eight-week period that the survey was

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,450
open

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:59,400
I received 326 responses which I was

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:04,110
really pleased with because although

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:06,029
this is a really low response rate I was

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,360
anticipating a low response rate anyway

00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:15,900
so so anything past 30 I was really

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:17,670
pleased with so this is how they came in

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,880
that's the timeline and you can see that

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:23,910
it's kind of peaks and troughs and so

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:29,250
what I did next was just to overlay here

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:31,230
the timing of the the reminders and the

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,520
notifications that I sent out to see

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,230
what impact they had on this on how the

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:42,630
responses came in so the first one here

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:44,940
is the initial initial diary entry and

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,709
then that's the second diary entry so we

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,040
get kind of little peaks and then tails

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:56,520
off after that and this was the impact

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:59,190
of my Facebook post which you know like

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,650
8 responses I mean they may not be

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,270
responses but there's no you know

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,279
there's no immediate response to that

00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,350
and none of my friends are on

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,900
OpenStreetMap so you know there's no

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:15,870
surprise there but the other thing we've

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:18,390
got is this peak around day 23 and that

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,570
has nothing to do with my own personal

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:27,750
activity so I looked on the on the

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:29,560
comments thread and saw that on day 23

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,800
there is

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:38,279
a thread between a couple of fairly

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:40,990
influential active OpenStreetMap members

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,529
with regard to the kind of gender issue

00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,240
in OpenStreetMap and i don't know if

00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:49,060
there's any direct correlation here but

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,540
on the same day would get 48 responses

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,940
and then in the ensuing days you know 8

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,760
9 responses over a period of about three

00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:03,970
or four days on each day so it's

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:06,970
possible that these this comment thread

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:11,380
has had a positive influence on the

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:13,510
response rate so something to think

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,300
about is that the recruiting the support

00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,670
of key users may help to recruit others

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,190
to the cause the theory being that once

00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:26,290
sanctioned by someone but the community

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:28,150
trusts others you know might be more

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:34,060
likely to get on board with with the

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:36,970
work so I'm just going to go through the

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,300
response rates again so once we'd

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:43,750
whittled out the 33 duplications sorry

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,700
the 33 exclusions so I got some

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,200
duplications so people were not sure

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,600
whether they'd actually completed the

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,290
survey correctly and a few people have

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,300
done it twice in some case there was

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,550
there was an unwillingness to provide a

00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,990
username people were completing the

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,410
survey they knew that they were going to

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:04,570
have to provide their username but then

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,370
left a funny comment where it's that

00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,320
user name instead of actually putting

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:12,220
the user name sort of exclude those

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,020
responses if there was a typo in the

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,020
user name I wasn't able to find that on

00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,240
the wiki pages I wasn't able to find

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,730
that that uses data so I couldn't use it

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,560
and then I also had responses from

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,529
people who had an account but have no

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,209
edits so there was no actual behavior or

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,089
activity that I could analyze so I had

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:36,279
to execute those responses as well so we

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:37,839
ended up with 297 in our sample and I'm

00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,100
just going to compare that to the only

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,950
other substantive

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,140
of demographic survey of OpenStreetMap

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:49,720
users that's been done and that's by PhD

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:52,210
student called nama buddha Toki back in

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,290
he was collecting data in 2009 and

00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:58,000
published in 2010 and he got a slightly

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:03,580
higher response rate of nine point three

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,620
seven percent and so four hundred and

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,990
forty responses out back there and one

00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,080
hundred and twenty thousand registered

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:15,270
users but here's a slightly different

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,950
sampling process whereby he was able to

00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,410
so I think he was quite skilled at this

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:25,690
but he created some kind of algorithm to

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:28,870
identify active users and then was able

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,340
to send out a direct message to thirty

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,130
three thousand four hundred and forty

00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:36,460
News as directly asking them to complete

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:40,650
the survey so he probably accessed many

00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:42,850
more potential respondents than I did

00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:45,610
using the user Diaries and the mailing

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,470
lists he was also not requesting the

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,110
user name so he was not asking for any

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,210
personal data whereas I was asking

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,890
people to provide information that would

00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,890
enable me to look at their activity

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:12,019
so I'm just going to share the results

00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:14,759
here so this is the most up-to-date

00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:16,970
information about the structure of the

00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,949
community or at least about the

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:23,550
responding community to my survey and

00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:25,430
I've got data that suggests that the

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,439
people that responded are actually

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:34,199
representative of the wider sample if we

00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:37,370
think about the 1991 rule whereby that

00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:40,410
we've got a lot of people conducting

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:43,319
very very few edits and then vice versa

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:47,610
so so my sample did reflect that pattern

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:53,129
of contributing so what this is gender

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:56,759
so this is how my sample breaks down 87

00:14:53,129 --> 00:15:00,410
percent men 13% women so enormous survey

00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:03,540
was 96 percent men 4 percent women so

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:07,949
it's impossible to know whether this is

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:14,850
representative so with either got many

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:15,959
more people or many more women or I'm

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,819
just going to click on because I've only

00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:20,790
got three minutes left so I'm just

00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:23,160
rattling through these results then so

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:26,189
this is the age range of the of the

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,009
respondents we've still got either the

00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:36,029
largest percentage in the 20 to 40 age

00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:39,750
groups the majority are still highly

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:46,470
educated so we've got 73% with either a

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:48,620
degree or post-grad certificate and most

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,939
of our respondents are still in Europe

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,250
although this has spread to North

00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:54,750
America a slightly more rate over the 10

00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,059
years and this is probably something to

00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:03,870
do with the maturity of the project in

00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:05,610
those in Europe so I'm just going to in

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,899
this little part here I'm again going to

00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:10,199
rattle through this because I'm running

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,110
out of time so I'm just going to share

00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:15,420
some of the

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,910
kind of more qualitative reflections on

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:21,630
how this work was kind of received

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:25,050
within the community and I'm basing

00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:27,090
these on either the the diary entries or

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,550
direct messages via OpenStreetMap

00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:33,560
messages or responses to the emails and

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:36,540
there was a real suspicion about my

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,100
credibility and my identity and you can

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,560
just see here some of the kind of

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,870
message that I got not identifying

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,880
yourself as troubling you know you

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,770
should have done some work in our firm

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,770
before actually completing this study

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:57,750
people are also very protective of you

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,790
know quite rightly of what they're doing

00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:05,220
in OpenStreetMap and some felt

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,440
threatened by my wanting to examine this

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,730
and this really highlights the

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,920
importance of really clearly

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,540
articulating your research agenda when

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,850
attempting to recruit the the

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:19,760
participation and the cooperation of a

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:24,209
few of your potential participants and

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,920
thirdly there was a sense that although

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,050
I tried to be as clear as I possibly

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,180
could be about what I was doing about

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:33,090
what data I was collecting and why I was

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,790
collecting it there was still a sense

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,740
that there was a bit of a must

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,480
misunderstanding about what I was doing

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,680
and the fact that my work was related to

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,410
gender it's somehow was conflated with

00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:50,370
with broader gender issues in in

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:52,470
OpenStreetMap which it's actually quite

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,660
distinct from that because I'm coming at

00:17:52,470 --> 00:18:00,180
it from probably the other end of the

00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:01,890
spectrum to some of those things so on

00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,180
the other side of that so having just

00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,220
talked about some of the challenges and

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,860
the limitations I also got some lovely

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,420
comments from people who were so there

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,120
is support out there within the

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,000
community for this kind of work people

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,080
find it interesting they think it's

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,850
valuable and valid

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,300
and that that's my best your work is

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:28,830
awesome I love that that's not peer

00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:30,360
review though unfortunately so this is

00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,520
just some things to think about if

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,440
anybody's you know when we're wanting to

00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,110
kind of learn from the community who

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,430
actually conduct this work and we you

00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,010
know we wanted to kind of learn how

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:43,830
things can be improved this is just a

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:46,559
kind of summary of some of the things to

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:51,900
think about the sampling issues having

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:54,809
access to the survey how what mailing

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,920
list works you know which language to

00:18:54,809 --> 00:19:00,450
use getting the crowd on board which is

00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,620
perhaps something we can do through the

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:06,480
science academic stream and issues of

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,030
understanding and really clearly

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,750
articulating your research agenda so

00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:15,120
then you're not alienating people and

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:20,460
people can see the value and the

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:23,580
validity of what you're trying to do so

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,860
probably over time now so these are just

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,809
some of my own personal reflections and

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,470
some kind of questions that have come

00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:34,470
out of this process and we're going to

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:38,250
open it up to the crowd so how do we

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,750
think about all of these things and so

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,980
we can either talk about people can

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:45,720
respond in terms of this this list here

00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,850
or people can offer up their own

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,890
suggestions or their own own reflections

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,480
if if there's any participants here

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,820
people that actually responded to my

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,150
survey thank you very very much

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,530
and I have so far published two

00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:01,050
conference papers with the results of

00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:04,650
the survey and we'll be publishing more

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:06,760
so your work was very much appreciated

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:15,590
and has been used and

00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:22,549
thank you Thank You Zoe we have already

00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:24,799
a couple of questions Thank You Zoe so

00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:26,720
my name is Janet from crowd to map that

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,970
was really really interesting I know

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,760
we've communicated a little bit so I've

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,350
done a survey for the mic the the

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,890
mappers in crowd to map which obviously

00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:40,010
is a different subset of osm and we had

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,419
very different findings so they were the

00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:44,690
majority of them were very new to our

00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:47,840
sermons specifically joined for you know

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:54,070
a more concrete reason perhaps and they

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:56,570
were 57% women and that was from 125

00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:59,270
respondents I think if anyone's

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:02,750
interested in that I can share the

00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,909
results I did this off of my own bat so

00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,650
and I'm not a researcher so I'm sure I

00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:08,419
did lots of things wrong and it would be

00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:11,210
really interesting to collaborate with

00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:16,100
academics that know what they're doing

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:18,020
so I just respond to that and I was in

00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,770
the gentleman the gentleman love's

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,860
session yesterday and I was treating

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:27,940
that very much as a kind of ethnographic

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:31,220
process I had many questions about that

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:35,480
you know what was being said there but

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,890
one of the things that I I think perhaps

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,289
is something to think about is I'm

00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:41,030
looking at the community as a whole were

00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:44,409
think there's a lot quite a few subsets

00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:46,700
of the community and the motivations of

00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:49,130
different types of mappers will differ

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,620
and the things that they map are very

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:54,860
different so I'm not sure whether but

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:58,299
the OpenStreetMap it's not a homogenous

00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,299
pool of people

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:14,110
about the diary stats I had the same

00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,850
problem I posted an issue and they said

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:19,930
yeah it would be insane to try and build

00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:23,020
that so I didn't pursue that but if you

00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:24,820
add an image to your thing from an

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,970
external provider you can get an

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,440
indirect statistics that's what I always

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,320
do because I'd like to know how many

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,670
people really for mailing list

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,290
statistics I've seen a decent platform

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,940
so that you could get an idea of how

00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,190
many people are active I'll post a link

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:48,250
to the main wiki page about mailing

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:48,850
lists and yeah yeah well so you explain

00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,700
that

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,800
you had to explain all the details about

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,670
your survey because otherwise people

00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:59,440
would think who is this person but kind

00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,570
of counterproductive from a scientific

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,090
point of view because the more you know

00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:07,540
about a survey before taking it the more

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,310
you have a subsample of people who are

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,290
interested in a subject and hence less

00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:20,710
representative so that's a real issue I

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:22,990
don't know separate kind of ghent the

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,690
demographic you know the participation

00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:29,410
bias from the gender and diversity issue

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:31,920
so I probably got a higher response rate

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:35,710
from people who have an interest in that

00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,990
and a lot of those people will be women

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,360
so I'm not sure that the gender

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:43,360
breakdown I got is representative but

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,730
having come to this conference you know

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,720
that kind of there's not a lot of like

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:55,390
geeky young males here actually sorry

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:58,990
lasting you mentioned translation and

00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:02,560
and diffusion problems like how can we

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:05,050
ensure that as diverse as possible

00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,450
public will take this survey I think

00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,160
that's something where the wider osm

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,830
community could be of help because it's

00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,680
also a problem we have that many people

00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:17,050
want to do surveys but usually they are

00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,360
small and independent and sometimes it's

00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,169
just someone doing them which is great

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,649
but then

00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:27,669
also like a bit chaotic so there could

00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:30,369
be a win-win if from the community well

00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:32,230
or if you start with your survey and

00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:35,350
then the community can provide

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:38,889
translations so that the scientist

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:42,639
doesn't have to do that yeah just an ID

00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:45,159
I mean if if there was some kind of

00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:48,820
database where people could volunteer

00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:53,289
their demographics or you know other

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,700
aspects about themselves then you know I

00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:56,289
wouldn't actually need to survey the

00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:00,970
community because you could just analyze

00:24:56,289 --> 00:25:06,190
that map data I think there's a

00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:09,029
reluctance to do that I'd like to

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:12,639
respond directly to this comment about

00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:14,739
the users knowing too much about the

00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:16,210
survey and here are one of the comments

00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:18,789
that you actually showed on the screen

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:22,509
makes sense just show a bit more about

00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:25,389
the past research you've done so about

00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:27,759
the past research that you've done so so

00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:29,950
that people get an idea of your style of

00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,749
doing research maybe make sure that

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:35,830
these articles are actually open access

00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:37,419
and or at least explained in some blog

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,940
posts or so that is accessible to a

00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:41,470
broader audience and then you don't need

00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,539
to give details about this ongoing

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,759
research projects but still you can

00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:48,039
enhance the motivation of people to

00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,629
participate well I don't have a problem

00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,970
like that because this is actually my

00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:55,509
first postdoc post and I didn't actually

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:58,659
have any publications to share with the

00:25:55,509 --> 00:26:02,730
community so if I hadn't had those

00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:06,820
things I did actually share my personal

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:09,690
research page in the one of the use the

00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,820
diary entries when I published the

00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:14,679
survey so I shared as much about my

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,230
research and about myself as long as I

00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:19,710
possibly could there was no

00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:22,620
you know sense of concealing anything or

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:25,159
wanting to do that so as much as I

00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:30,110
possibly could I did I just didn't have

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,110
the information to share unfortunately

00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:40,769
hello hi I'm the disparity in the

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:44,850
genders was that consistent across all

00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:47,789
the ages or was there a marked drop off

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:50,970
of women at any particular age or an

00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:54,000
increase I haven't done that analysis

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,620
yet there is it's coming up but I

00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
haven't actually done any kind of cross

00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:02,639
analysis it of actual groups of you know

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,380
any kind of profiling yeah so as soon as

00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:11,789
I've done that I will share it okay I

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:13,700
think it's in the plan to do okay sorry

00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:17,159
we have to close here to give the usual

00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:20,630
couple of minutes to move if you want to

00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,630
