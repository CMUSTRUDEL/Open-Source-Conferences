oh you would you saw satellite table

00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:13,740
douche produced early tenure comes up

00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:18,660
top the obscure CRC's you know fat

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:23,609
family dramatically my code faster

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:32,480
general Jam body Michael Fox fascinated

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:37,489
eme covet okay so we're going to get

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:46,190
we're going to get started in this truck

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:46,190
which has been labeled a journey through

00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:54,390
OpenStreetMap in francophone countries

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:59,070
from 2010 to 2018 in ite

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:02,420
and West Africa and mainly the talk is

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:07,860
three parts the first part is going to

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:11,909
try to provide insight on the mechanisms

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,040
that has been set forced to support the

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:18,689
growth of OpenStreetMap in those

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:23,360
countries and some of the results that

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:27,509
are going to be brought life to us via

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:33,240
ambassadors from Senegal Ivory Coast and

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:35,759
to go and we're also going to have a

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,979
second component of the track which will

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:44,460
focus on oh it's possible to generate

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:49,170
value and do that in a way which is

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:55,369
compatible with voluntary animation

00:01:49,170 --> 00:02:00,770
schemes around OpenStreetMap and lastly

00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:07,200
we're going to old a sort of roundtable

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:11,459
to focus on a couple of items that will

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,530
be just surfaced through the talks of

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:19,760
the two first components

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:26,700
and mainly on a very empirical note

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:31,830
we're going to start from what it is to

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:35,489
try to to develop OpenStreetMap in in

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:39,569
poor countries and focus on all the

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,670
challenges ahead for the people from the

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:46,170
south that just wants to use

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:49,320
OpenStreetMap and to make it and that's

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:52,650
going to bring us through the concrete

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:56,160
difficulties that young men and young

00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:00,420
talented women in IT and africa

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,120
wrestling with and also see that

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,140
surprisingly have the many difficulties

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:11,180
gender in at least in in Western African

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:15,930
countries is not specifically an issue

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:21,200
which some is sort of lesson for the

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,200
rest of the OpenStreetMap ecosystem and

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,709
finally we are also going to cast light

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:34,590
on the limits of what has been done so

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:38,540
far throughout eight years and pinpoints

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:43,019
the difficulties that that are happening

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:45,630
in the way that individual and

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,579
collectives organising themselves to

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,329
carry out their OpenStreetMap activities

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:55,320
so basically that's the the three

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:59,250
components of of the truck that that we

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:03,959
decided to put together quite a number

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:11,000
of us who are gathered here in in Milano

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:11,000
so I'm going to eat the road first and

00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:21,810
to focus on the subject of that of that

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:24,990
slide which is OS n 3d is an open data

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,940
animation organization in size foreign

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:31,170
countries it's in Africa

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:35,800
that's a sort of umbrella under which

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:39,060
are going to to fall for speakers that

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,490
are going to get more into details oh

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:47,830
they are making OpenStreetMap a reality

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:50,850
in that territories so first I think

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:55,020
that this is this is what we are

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:59,010
wrestling with when we think about

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:04,990
growing or reinforcing OpenStreetMap in

00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:14,530
in territories of of Africa and the

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:19,690
Caribbean so this context if we want to

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:23,560
if we want to briefly describe it is

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:27,550
going to pose the following series of

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:31,480
challenges we're going to have to

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:35,110
operate within the humanitarian and

00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:37,680
development world logics which are

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,390
necessarily not necessarily

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,220
OpenStreetMap friendly or can appear to

00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:47,080
be OpenStreetMap friendly but in the

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:50,230
fact can be difficulties for for the

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,020
development of OpenStreetMap we're going

00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,750
to wrestle for sure with context of

00:05:53,020 --> 00:06:01,510
poverty and context of crisis pre or

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:06,390
post crisis which will be specific we're

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:11,380
going also to have to take into account

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:13,240
and to adapt to the weakness of free GIS

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,550
and open data capacities in those

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,040
countries although the landscape is

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,690
moving and more and more capacities are

00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:27,480
being built and new actors are emerging

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:32,980
weakness is also unfortunately yet in

00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:36,070
2018 a good descriptors of the free

00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,979
software's and open data movement in in

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,060
those territories outside of the capital

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:47,590
and a couple of select herbs

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:53,500
there's those realities are fragile and

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:58,000
tiny and within that realm and that

00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,330
weakness the reality and denialism of

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,770
free collaborative projects like

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:07,570
OpenStreetMap or Wikipedia is also

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:14,470
something which which is even more for

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:16,330
joy so those issues or those elements of

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:23,440
the context in which we had been

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:27,100
operating since 2010 basically put

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,530
forward the main the main dilemma now

00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,560
the main paradoxical for OpenStreetMap

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:39,220
project we had to adapt free voluntary

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:44,050
autonomous project which emerged in in

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:48,090
countries of the nose on civilizations

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:53,080
which are said rich in terms of incomes

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:57,910
into poor countries of the south and and

00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,640
what we want to foster is a practice of

00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:04,480
OpenStreetMap which will be regular and

00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:07,780
which will tend to be massive or at

00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:13,960
least be important beyond thousands of

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:17,530
people and in so doing in solving that

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,980
that's contradiction we want to be sure

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:25,090
that what's going to emerge in the south

00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:28,920
is going to stay true to the values and

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:32,310
the modus operandi of OpenStreetMap and

00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,440
will contribute diversity to

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:39,460
OpenStreetMap emerge in the north but

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:48,960
without betraying some of its core

00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:52,540
values and and practices so without any

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,970
preset schemes and operational schemes

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:59,019
what what

00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,639
from those eight years of work and is a

00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:03,760
following approach that can be

00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:06,370
characterized as follow so we try to

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,540
develop something which which tends to

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:15,180
be autonomous from the humanitarian and

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:17,860
development system autonomous but not

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,670
without any relations capable of

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:26,470
relations with this field but with an

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:29,440
autonomy we want and which why'd she

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:33,880
keep all the animation work of

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:38,220
OpenStreetMap relevant to the GIS work

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:42,610
or the open data work afternoon in

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:46,209
development or crisis response and

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:49,149
crisis preparedness we try to mix as

00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:53,649
much as possible remote and direct field

00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:56,350
work and we also try to articulate the

00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:58,300
scales and be sure that everything's

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,060
happening locally can be sported

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,269
globally and that local collectives are

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:07,620
able to strike relations with actors

00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:10,839
that are outside of that territories so

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,889
basically the whole idea is to build

00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:18,269
circulations within the francophone area

00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:25,380
under sighs sighs no sighs snores

00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:25,380
directions and ultimately which white

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:37,420
succeeding between limits into combining

00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:39,850
and paid to voluntary and economic

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,660
project schemes so basically that's the

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:46,630
approach in general and the the

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:52,930
challenges that that we had to wrestle

00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:56,699
with so with this in mind the objectives

00:10:52,930 --> 00:11:01,029
and what we what we tried what we try to

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:03,910
bring and put forward which to help

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:06,790
start and consolidate the same projects

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:10,540
in in that area of the world

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:15,060
and we want this consolidation to emerge

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:19,720
as local OpenStreetMap collective that

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:23,710
organized and that are autonomous we

00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,010
want and we try to collectively build

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,490
and OpenStreetMap expertise around data

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:34,660
creation trainings and symbolization

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:39,100
outreach communications we try to secure

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:45,430
the necessary out of a part for that

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:51,970
expertise to enfold and we also try to

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:56,650
secure access to workspaces for the

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:59,820
necessity to adjust to local ways of

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:02,920
doing things which which are not only

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:07,840
virtual but needs to be grounded into

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:11,620
territories and direct contact with the

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:15,760
above and OpenStreetMap collective will

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,770
be locally able to adapt the USM ways

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,330
from the north to its context and

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:23,680
invents new ways of doing OpenStreetMap

00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:28,030
that collective will be able to build

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:33,340
relations in countries with all the tech

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:40,690
and GS actors in their countries but

00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:44,220
also outside they will by so doing

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:48,610
develop a capacity to act with impact

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:52,450
all through the continuum in between

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:58,410
development and and crisis work they

00:12:52,450 --> 00:13:01,780
will be able to significantly support

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:05,620
OpenStreetMap mobilization in response

00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:08,500
to humanitarian crisis for southern

00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,580
unset crises that are under the media

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,790
but as well be impactful on long-term

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,940
political fo'get in crisis like in South

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:24,190
African

00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:27,890
and they will act and they're acting

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:30,410
articulating in a quite efficient manner

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:33,440
the three layers of the OpenStreetMap

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:38,660
echo system the community layer the

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:41,150
layer of an OpenStreetMap country

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,070
collective or associations working as a

00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:48,590
de-facto OpenStreetMap foundation

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:51,800
chapter and they will also be able to do

00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:57,410
that be active on the community and the

00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:00,320
chapter front with within the economic

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:05,480
sectors acting as economic operators

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:08,420
managing quite well or satisfaction a

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:13,280
satisfactory manner the possible

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:15,710
conflict of interest that can arise in

00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,340
terms of of activities what what has

00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:23,350
been unfolding for years now on the kind

00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:27,590
of regular basis or the below activities

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:31,790
information outreach advising around

00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:36,680
OpenStreetMap trainings mapping

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:44,510
campaigns general ones or somatic ones

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:49,250
and there will be an activity of of

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:53,060
mentoring to grow a collective of our

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:58,330
network of trainers and animators in

00:14:53,060 --> 00:15:02,210
that area activities of documentation z'

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:08,380
communications and learning from the

00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:08,380
experience which has been unfolding what

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:19,250
what has been what has been done to

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:23,720
support those activities have been

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:27,560
destroyed partnerships and to allow

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:32,170
local collectives to get access to

00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:41,770
external resources and partners and

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:46,160
access to workspaces so quite quite

00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:48,680
without it without any much surprise the

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,340
following the following places or the

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:56,000
following type of factors I've been I've

00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,540
been approached and are part of that

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,200
dynamic

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:06,020
we have academics academics actors

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:08,660
within that from this the computing

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,620
microphone of the agents universitaire

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:16,240
de la Francophonie

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:21,530
we've got tech spaces we've got turn all

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:24,100
we can also have access to NGOs or

00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:28,820
international organisations workplaces

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:31,100
but also everyone in that area of the

00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:35,900
world is able to mobilize its own

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,350
resource tiny community centers internet

00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,640
coffee

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:47,210
Mackie's houses even the streets

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:54,350
sometimes the impacts that that have

00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:59,650
been that have been so it is and what we

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:05,330
can see is is that we managed through

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:11,810
those those ways of working to develop

00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:15,440
some some animations before during and

00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:19,430
after any phases of work be that project

00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:23,220
a benevolent project or something which

00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:27,780
is bound to an economic framework

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:33,210
and that activity plays a role of

00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:38,190
catalyst it's it's allows basically to

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:42,690
grow capacity of the main animators of

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:46,850
that those OpenStreetMap collectives it

00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:50,370
allows more diverse OpenStreetMap

00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:55,560
animations after the after the activity

00:17:50,370 --> 00:18:02,240
and it's also builds the capacity to

00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:05,700
scale up the OpenStreetMap animations by

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:10,890
reaching out to new partners reaching

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:13,980
out enlarging the basis of of the

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:17,910
community members enlarging the network

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:22,770
of animators and generating more

00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:25,920
attentions and making easier the

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:31,220
mobilizations of current resources and

00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:34,830
additional resources all this is

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:40,050
reinforcing and a pre-existing autonomy

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:43,160
and is to be supported for any actors

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:49,410
willing to out grow up in street map

00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:51,870
through various ways of of support all

00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:56,490
those things need to be articulated

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:59,970
locally and globally and any experience

00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:04,730
from the OpenStreetMap world is now able

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:10,620
to connect to the reality of of the

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:14,880
OpenStreetMap collected from the size in

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:17,550
terms of in terms of actions at the

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,230
level of individual and collectives what

00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:24,450
has been organized by the many people

00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,630
involved in that animations or the

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:30,540
following things you are training and

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:33,910
mentoring activities around technical

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:36,610
and organizational aspects of

00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:41,580
the OpenStreetMap free GIS and open data

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:45,160
animations so that they can make the

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:47,470
project their own with respect to their

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,820
specific context

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:56,050
this will span now techniques tools to

00:19:51,820 --> 00:20:00,100
create user free geographical data be

00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:06,420
able to train at various level on on the

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:10,500
above that will put forth the virtue of

00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:13,090
contributing to OpenStreetMap through

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,750
benevolent activities of teaching

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:21,670
networking education that we also love

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:26,200
for professionalization and that will

00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:28,360
also support economic project design so

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,270
that they can be carried out in a way

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,910
which will grow the OpenStreetMap

00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:38,200
ecosystem that will allow the people

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:40,890
active in the implementation of the

00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:45,670
project to boost their skills to reach

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:50,110
new partners new members and contribute

00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:53,400
to the comments of the OpenStreetMap

00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:57,580
project so concretely that can be

00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,160
furnishing resources to an OpenStreetMap

00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:03,460
local collective or an associations or

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,340
chapters in the forms of money to buy

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,560
the rent or access to workspaces tiny

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:12,610
bits of hardware that are actually

00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,700
needed or that can be small

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:19,210
contributions to the low operational

00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:25,440
budget under which it's possible to do

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:30,430
things impactful in the size lastly that

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:33,040
training and mentoring is also focusing

00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:37,950
on the organizational and governance

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:41,660
supports to all those collective so that

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:47,050
emerged mature

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:51,020
Oh SM chapters able to carry out under

00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:53,330
the OpenStreetMap ethos the role of such

00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:58,520
a chapter the way that it happens in

00:21:53,330 --> 00:22:03,710
countries of the nose the actors that

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:08,450
are beyond this animation mechanisms for

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:11,620
organizations within or in between

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:16,240
countries in that area of the world

00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:19,310
mainly have been experts or members of

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,310
the association's relief of Geograph

00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,370
 wife as well as all the

00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:27,170
OpenStreetMap collectives and

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:30,380
associations and local mappers from

00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,970
those various various countries that we

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,710
can name at that state of the

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:37,030
presentation we've got people from IT

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:43,930
we've got people from Mali Niger Burkina

00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:48,620
Faso Ivory Coast Senegal to go Benna

00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:57,050
Chad net we certain extent Madagascar

00:22:48,620 --> 00:23:01,970
and Ghana as well as and in the first

00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:06,590
eight countries what the ways under

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:08,270
which things are happening are easier

00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:12,080
series of projects that have been

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:18,020
designed and implemented by and with the

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:20,090
directions of the economic and digital

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:23,930

Internacional de la Francophonie direct

00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:31,600
supports to OpenStreetMap animations we

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:34,250
had i/o I F volunteering programs namely

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,730
program they are Internacional de

00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,980
Francophonie we add international and

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:43,100
technical organization capacity building

00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:46,030
projects we add documentation project

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,470
around the USM free geomatics

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:52,929
organizational aspect of OpenStreetMap

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:57,020
development of tools aside of if'

00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:58,909
significative Lee terrorism Institute of

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:04,190
Oshkosh Polly develop more and grads

00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:07,159
have been the main supporters of those

00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:11,150
eight years of activities new actors are

00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:13,460
getting into the scene and that can be

00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:19,520
something extremely beneficial for the

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:19,909
ecosystems if we want to if we want to

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,049
see

00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:26,270
oh those projects are just organizing

00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:30,409
and lining themselves in terms of what's

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:34,870
happening on a regular basis in those in

00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:37,730
those territories shall you witness and

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:42,279
scrutinized the OpenStreetMap activities

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:45,710
you will see a mix of community driven

00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:52,039
actions training mapping parties

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:55,730
mapperton prisons in conferences you

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:59,419
will have the same kind of activities

00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:02,630
that can happen as the Association

00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:03,559
projector of activities on its own

00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,059
budget or

00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:13,490
on a voluntary basis you will have

00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:18,159
capacity-building actions led by of' de

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:21,010
Graaff you will have activities towards

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:25,970
beneficiaries as well as trainers and

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:30,080
you will have you will have economic

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:33,409
projects carried out by the same the

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:37,789
same actors speaking of the niveau de

00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:41,289
Graaff projects have been have been

00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:43,440
organized with local mappers and

00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:51,960
collectives with

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:55,230
if' and great IRD and now we see merging

00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,320
new actors like Catherine Dre missing

00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:01,889
mobs the red crosses where's the

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:05,190
American Red Cross Benes oh I FSC we

00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:07,500
have the at USA micro grants all these

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:10,080
can turns into valuable resources and

00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:15,779
new resources for those OpenStreetMap

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:21,389
collectives but what we've been taught

00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:23,279
by the years of practices is that it

00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:25,320
will be very important for all those new

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:30,870
actors arriving in that area of the

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:34,590
world to be to be active to be cautious

00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:38,220
to the OpenStreetMap governments and to

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:40,980
combine ammonius like the three layers

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,230
of the OpenStreetMap governments the

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,379
activities that are done at a community

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:49,139
level what is being done at the level of

00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:53,220
knob and street map associations of

00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:55,110
collective and oh we are doing and

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:59,730
creating economic values within

00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:03,000
OpenStreetMap the second layer of

00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:05,940
concern as to do with communications I

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,889
think that communications truth in

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,809
communications and attributions is

00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:13,340
something which is really paramount for

00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:17,070
the ecosystem to remain healthy and

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:20,309
lastly and probably the most important

00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:22,950
is that the autonomy of OpenStreetMap is

00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:28,139
something that is not negotiable it has

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:32,250
to remain centered on itself outside of

00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:35,269
the internal logic of the humanitarians

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:37,460
and development actors no one could have

00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:39,990
significant if they think that

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:44,039
OpenStreetMap in France could have rise

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:46,470
if OpenStreetMap as to comply with the

00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:48,840
requirement or the logics of the French

00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:54,000
national mapping agency so that's

00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:56,840
exactly the same that not asked to be

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,840
thought when

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,030
using opportunities provided by actors

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:08,430
of this of the of that will in in that

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:11,710
area of the world I think that for us

00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:14,290
that's going to be all in terms of

00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:19,210
descriptions of the challenges the

00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:24,220
approaches it unfold and now that will

00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:27,880
be up to ladies from West Africa to

00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:31,810
provide us with more details on oh this

00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:43,210
translate into reality and oh the above

00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:46,180
has been digested and reused now after

00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,740
these 20 minutes 25 minutes and this

00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,860
Marathi which has not been translated

00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:52,680
into English comes the time for

00:28:50,860 --> 00:29:04,000
questions

00:28:52,680 --> 00:29:06,760
see italiano why I have no question you

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,290
have talked about the documentation of

00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,540
the project elf I would like to know if

00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:15,940
because I know that's very nice

00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:19,710
documentation but how we can access that

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,710
documentation online if it's possible

00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,270
that's a wonderful question

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:34,750
so with seven others we've wrote a lot

00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:40,870
of documentation that's true and its

00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:42,810
life has been mostly non web-based it's

00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:47,440
something which is being circulated

00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:52,090
mostly through USB keys in the the

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:59,650
various territories they can be accessed

00:29:52,090 --> 00:30:04,299
and downloaded from it a folder of the

00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:09,749
lollipop graph website we're working in

00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:12,609
having a better layout of all the the

00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:14,799
various pieces that has been that has

00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:19,029
been wrote that's something that's going

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:23,589
to be accessible through the llj website

00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:27,429
which shall be up and running probably

00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:30,999
at the end of this summer and the second

00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:34,119
element inside the documentation as its

00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:39,190
maintenance the number of people that

00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:41,879
are truly contributing to that is is not

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:47,349
huge so at the moment we keep the things

00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:52,329
simple so basically we are relying on a

00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:58,269
series of of google documents working

00:30:52,329 --> 00:31:02,709
one and the final ones and we just opted

00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:07,200
to invite people interested in to

00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:13,119
contributing to do that with with us and

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:17,099
just scale up the tech as soon as there

00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:20,169
are enough maintenance that that will

00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:21,789
show the bottlenecks of of the

00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:25,599
maintenance approach that we have so far

00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:28,089
so that's for it but it's it's a low

00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:31,629
internet presence and it's probably

00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:34,059
prejudicial to to the future of those

00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:44,619
documents that we are trying to work on

00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:47,879
it I was also curious to know what is

00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:47,879
the project question

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:23,649
no question or shall we call to the

00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:28,509
Tribuna to go or Ivory Coast's no or

00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:32,909
Senegal day debt yeah something go not

00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:32,909
for question my dear for presentation

00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:36,809
