at at the inception so far OpenStreetMap

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,540
in Ivory Coast

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,910
just a mapping party thrown out by one

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,390
of the big guy there Sebastian yeah Poe

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:29,780
was lecturing in an engineering school

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:32,370
in the commune of McCrory in Abidjan and

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,980
basically after the mapping party which

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,670
has been well organized the young

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:41,280
participants just decided to self

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,470
organized and create OpenStreetMap

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,040
McCrory and then later on they just

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:50,700
realized grasping geography that Ivory

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,160
Coast is not only mockery it's something

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,770
which is wider so they decided to change

00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:03,410
the name for OpenStreetMap cote d'ivoire

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:06,660

develop ensues l open data so the core

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,430
objectives that have been set since the

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:28,920
very beginnings to just do OpenStreetMap

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,980
meaning promoting and improving the map

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,440
in ivory coast and by so doing do that

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,600
with a focus and the focus has been on

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:41,910
the young people from the academic and

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:46,590
to meet the needs in terms of open data

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:53,730
tools and and the techniques and methods

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:58,070
that goes with that long lens was taken

00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,570

pay less smart phone a less ordinate

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,859
hopefully DCO so here are the tools that

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,019
are common to all of us and well known

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:25,500
one thing that rocky wanted to emphasize

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,410
has been the role that field papers play

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,030
that's the very beginning of

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,880
the OpenStreetMap community in ivory

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:35,420
coast in 2014 where a smartphone were

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:39,520
not that widely disseminated in ivory

00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:43,340
coast and basically huge chunks of

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:52,670
obedient communes have been mapped only

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:54,170
with and through field papers under

00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,960
electron that schindler community

Oh quaff is oh say debajo Paco Gila

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,810
common division say that the organ is a

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,970
the mapping coming to valid even come in

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,990
de la ville division you see the mapping

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:21,490
region to Kohei on an organ is

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:24,590
inevitabie joe de la côte d'Ivoire in

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,030
terms of action plan everything is

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,520
structured in ivory coast

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,660
that's an emerging country now no longer

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,660
developing countries

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:39,680
the first important action is is

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,480
outreach and and communications around

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,470
OpenStreetMap but in a very practical

00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,780
way and like in Togo like in Senegal

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:51,550
they're active in the capital and

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:54,260
outside of the capital with in Abidjan

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,419
they are working commune by commune or

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,300
cafe by Cartier or neighborhood by

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:02,650
neighborhood through the project called

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,860
common mapping tour and outside of

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,650
Abidjan

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:12,200
they're going region by region through

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:20,930
that program called mapping relation to

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:24,919
a low not action say produce Laden is

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:53,030
so all those activities that promote

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:57,500
OpenStreetMap happen on a very practical

00:06:53,030 --> 00:07:00,889
note and convey towards creating quality

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:04,150
open data you've got more or less the

00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:07,580
same kind of organizational schemes

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:11,870
counterparties cart camps field and

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:14,810
remote mapping with a strong emphasis on

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:18,919
in terms of quality controls the idea is

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:21,979
to boost create data but also train

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,990
various possible partners of the

00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:27,470
OpenStreetMap communities and turn those

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:31,190
partners in two contributors focusing on

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:36,830
young people from the academics but with

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:42,849
it's letting aside government's at local

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,849
or central level as well as NGO or ing I

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:50,150
know this reflected on pauvre and

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,310
localization the different activities as

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,620
hopefully mapping coming to and a

00:07:52,310 --> 00:08:01,250
commune de la ville de Bruijn and a lot

00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:07,479
cote sits on a mapping version to those

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:12,319
two maps ilight were the OpenStreetMap

00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:16,819
ivory coast people have been active in

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,370
Abidjan on the right map and where

00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:27,409
they've been active in ivory coast on

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,380
internet so we're going to go through a

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,750
series of targeted activities

00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:00,680
materializing themselves by a tangible

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:03,380
outcomes one of the first one the people

00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,230
from Ivory Coast decided to engage the

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:12,580
resources is Pharma cart

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:16,970
so that's map of pharmacies which is

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:20,830
based on under technical solutions that

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:24,860
I love very simple cell phone to access

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,750
the data put on the map on all the

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,040
pharmacies that are the by default

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:38,210
pharmacies where you have to go when

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:40,580

la ville-nouvelle of it in neither

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,380
because they've been very practical and

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:22,790
as Abidjan on a yearly basis is

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:25,970
suffering flooding evans more or less

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:28,670
severe since 2014

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,730
they put up that that maps of flooding

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:35,060
which is basically you map which is open

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:40,100
to editing by anyone with some online

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:47,420
tutorials allowing anyone traveling into

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:52,640
the city to put to put force very simple

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:55,940
informations on the severity of of the

00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:01,040
flooding so that's a map which is being

00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:02,720
used widely once a year and which is a

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,200
good example of crowd service

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,200
information

00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:15,650
so say la carta Provence you know we use

same kind of maps on more important

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:59,030
issues that was the Ebola epidemic of

00:11:53,410 --> 00:12:03,140
2013-2014 where the focus was you have

disease to Ivory Coast was extremely

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:28,490

point I am going be long voila on a

00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,170
proposal here listen cartography

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:52,690
transfer he went live in Division four

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:58,370
facility low mobility LLC so just like

00:12:52,690 --> 00:13:03,490
like in Dhaka with what that showed us

00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:06,560
about map for transportation services

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:12,590
the people from OpenStreetMap Ivory

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:14,570
Coast are active putting up some

00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,190
resources into mapping urban

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,140
transportations

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,240
that's something which which is

00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,730
happening

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,700
throughout western Africa and which of

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,350
course is of importance for pants with

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,080
map given the number of talks that are

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:34,090
going to be featured on transportations

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:35,950
and OpenStreetMap in that's STM so in

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,680
Ivory Coast they're really on the same

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:46,570
page and for anyone that has been

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:52,150
chopped into into a bijin traffic that's

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:56,760
something which is very very useful when

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,760
I Galman process that is this unit on

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:05,470

Mejia dizzy mana on Engleman and port I

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,260
open show that cote d'ivoire study

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:20,290
sample to show graphic it has some

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:24,660
ladonia de côte de Vaca so the donor

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:28,450
material de santé education don't fuss

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:31,510
okay so we had three projects that have

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:38,770
been three night lightly the first one

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:42,910
is to keep up with the growing interest

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:46,750
and use of drones to capture local high

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:50,160
quality imagery and use that in in

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:53,890
mapping that's something which is under

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:58,210
discussions with in OpenStreetMap ivory

00:14:53,890 --> 00:15:02,490
coast they're also given their tech

00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:05,290
backgrounds fully interested in to

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:08,890
holding our own in mapperton and a

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:12,340
curtain after having participated to

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:15,310
various a curtain so that's going to be

00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,940
something that will of course and by

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,130
default

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:23,390
rely on OpenStreetMap data

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:26,570
and look at innovative or intelligent

00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:32,570
ways of using or some data for mobile

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:35,720
applications producing OpenStreetMap

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:38,600
data is something which is good using

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,120
OpenStreetMap data through the various

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,940
services for accessing the data is

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,190
something which is equally good but in

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,940
ivory cuz they just decided that they

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:55,370
needed to go a step further and set up

00:15:49,940 --> 00:16:00,170
themselves a geographical portal built

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:04,130
on second so that open geo data released

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:07,880
by the government can be accessible

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:10,820
through that geoportal a side of what

00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,430
has been put and set forth by by the

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:23,600
government so that initiative is called

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:26,330
open geo data dot see I know hey Lizzy

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,250

00:17:51,970 --> 00:18:04,190
okay so with a new project called Lu

00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:08,169
passage and ABC Rockies just said is

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:11,270
just presenting two initiatives of

00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:13,580
OpenStreetMap c SE e in partnerships

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:16,549
with the hasta - delicious paulo

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:21,140
development and its local partners as

00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:24,440
well as linimo giraffe at with two

00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:28,370
different focus liberty is project which

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:33,730
focus on malaria mosquito resistance in

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:39,110
the city of Boca which where you've got

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:43,279
an intra open agriculture sector which

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:46,159
is extremely active and the use and the

00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,570
growing use of pesticides as an effect

00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,990
on

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:54,680
the transmission of of malaria

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:58,520
so there was an effort to try to better

00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:03,650
identify this and there was need for a

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:07,580
very very detailed geo data on how the

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:10,520
in Schreyer burn agriculture in Bakke is

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:15,110
being organized which involves mapping

00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:17,510
plots but at the precision of a plot of

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:20,060
one material of one measure that can be

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:24,850
set forth just in front of a public

00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:33,470
service or just outside of a paved road

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:37,630
and also be able to map all the systems

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:40,700
of of research of of those pesticides

00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:44,240
the work of the people from a pen street

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,860
map CI has been to do the mapping we do

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,800
the mapping with people from social

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:51,950
sciences young researcher so those guys

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:57,170
have been taught to map and then they've

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:59,120
been Mantid into mapping creating the

00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:02,390
data models for the data that they need

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,210
and then they been equally mentored on

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:09,140
how to create mapping products to

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:13,970
support their investigations and being

00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:18,470
furnished with the service of of key GIS

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:24,100
maps and new maps we replicated the same

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:24,100
approach for project about Oh

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:32,240
rumors around Ebola disseminations

00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:36,710
able our cases disseminations after or

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,210
during the 2013 West African Ebola

00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:41,390
epidemic

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:45,620
I've been circulating in given

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:48,140
localities of of ivory coast and the

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:51,680
same kind of approach has been used

00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:55,250
there was a dedicated team of people

00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,740
from open sea I just working and

00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,950
mentoring young researcher from Social

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,220
Sciences into creating the data or we

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,760
use

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:14,570
in the data and sharing both data and Gi

00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:18,080
products another position illegal mafia

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:21,409
vaguely a daily lives ography OS MC say

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,440
the project go easy on any cohesion he

00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:30,200
uncle and also impose it on her shares

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:32,450
to la la constitución socio territorial

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,570
days in a gala t de la vie du Bois Keyon

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:38,360
fit well as a poor cartography to seek

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:42,320
ye stick to the Sante education you know

00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:45,260
point the point Oh wala he got more

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,559
voila he party see on the destructed

00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,679

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,679
different community

00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:57,320
yeah gal no new project after hood avec

00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,049
Michelin do mean this wiki uncovered as

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:05,720
impossible a cartography do his opt and

00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:10,730
code Eva so after the two project held

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:15,140
in black a with IAD and lip jagoff and

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:18,440
open sea I we just decided to go a step

00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:22,190
further and map the entire city of

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:25,159
barking so that's that the second

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:28,610
largest city in Ivory Coast totalling

00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:34,520
populations 1.3 million so that's not a

00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:37,340
small city and we managed to put up a

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:42,530
proposal which has been accepted to do

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:50,330
some medical geographical some else

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:54,049
Geographic projects around social

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:59,510
territorial inequalities I've been

00:22:54,049 --> 00:23:04,880
developing in in that city using Malay

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:09,320
as a proxy and the need for geo data is

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:13,990
very important in that project and it's

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:18,100
going to go also

00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:22,179
I level statistics we're using the data

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:26,470
to identify tiny areas where you will

00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:28,929
have a bio epidemiological survey as

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:32,260
well as social sciences surveys to

00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:36,309
better understand the Millea dynamics in

00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:40,480
that's in that cities and that also goes

00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:44,320
with a large capacity building component

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,420
project to Train both the internal crew

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,610
working on the project and all the

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:53,790
people part of that consortium but also

00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:59,470
all the partners of the geodata wells in

00:23:53,790 --> 00:24:03,100
in in working and and also to promote

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:05,700
all the result of the the ongoing

00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:09,340
research scientific visualizations

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:12,400
through an open science parodic an open

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,850
lab and all those things like that side

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,309
of of this focus on else geography

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:22,420
people from OpenStreetMap cote d'ivoire

00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:24,850
like people in Tagore in Senegal decided

00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:28,059
to eat the road and they do that with

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:33,580
Michelin through that project cattle

00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:35,590
were there fixing and working on

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:39,929
improving the comprehensiveness and

00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:50,580
quality of the the road networks of
