okay so we're going to close this truck

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:17,940
this journey through OpenStreetMap in

00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:24,000
francophone countries mostly IT Africa

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:26,760
with one research project and a couple

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,859
of views of the issues or the

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:35,480
difficulties that have to be overcome

00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:37,230
when you try to organized a grassroot

00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,780
OpenStreetMap collective in those

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,520
countries and carry out OpenStreetMap

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:47,910
open data free geomatics animation

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,690
programs so decision is going to be

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,250
twofold

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,870
after that presentation there will be a

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,809
sort of round table around that and here

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,969
we're going to start talking about

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:08,820
cohesion and cohesion is a research

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:12,000
project about else geography and malaria

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,920
which aims at better capturing the

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,340
social territorial constructions of

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:23,790
inequalities so that a territorial

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,909
diagnosis and material support

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:31,590
decision-making in burka can take place

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:35,450
that's projects which some fits into

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:40,380
that general approach of us which try to

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:42,619
find a way through the specifics of the

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:49,500
context of size french-speaking

00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:53,780
countries and the main issues that are

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:58,880
ad for OpenStreetMap and any kind of

00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:01,829
free geographical information system

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,869
open data and free software projects

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:09,720
which is basically how to adapt free

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,060
practices that are voluntary based

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,120
happening in rich countries from the

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,269
north

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,810
in poor countries of the size while

00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:25,840
remaining faithful to OpenStreetMap

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:30,340
principles so research is one part of

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:34,000
that equations and that research project

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,459
cohesion is a research program with

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,110
OpenStreetMap but it's not per se a

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,590
research project about

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:44,769
OpenStreetMap but this is a else

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,650
geography research project using

00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:52,049
OpenStreetMap and supporting

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:55,950
OpenStreetMap at the same times it's

00:02:52,049 --> 00:03:00,269
something that that happens through

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:05,049
legacy and an history of work and

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:06,810
relations in between institute or a

00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:13,890
sport development

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:19,209
IRD researchers and people from the

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:23,430
OpenStreetMap world people from libra

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:26,519
graph people from many of OpenStreetMap

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:30,099
collectives in western Africa and namely

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:36,129
people from OpenStreetMap Ivory Coast

00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:38,799
and what has been possible and

00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:40,889
instrumental to strike the relation has

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,549
been the constant support of

00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:49,480
organizational national de la

00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:53,980
Francophonie from 2014 to 2017 which

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:57,489
allows corporations of the training to

00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,349
take place and to build trust in the

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:05,590
ability of OpenStreetMap and

00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:10,260
OpenStreetMap mappers to serve as the

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:14,049
way forward for geodetic creations and

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,970
meeting geographical information needs

00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:19,150
for research project while at the same

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:25,900
time empowering young researchers

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:29,560
partners of ird and main actors of

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,590
the geographical and the territories in

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:37,330
which I the project are working so that

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:39,729
the D of s T - - pulley development is

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:43,570
something which ultimately is real and

00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:47,949
that a research project is going to

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:50,979
deliver way more than just the results

00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:55,060
some classic capacity buildings but will

00:04:50,979 --> 00:05:02,979
allow a wider ecosystems to form and

00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:06,010
benefit from an ongoing research so that

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:10,449
project has been put up mainly by people

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:15,160
from IRD and unli libre graph but the

00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:20,860
consortium behind cohesion is wider

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:23,530
you've got mainly two labs of ird Mira

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:29,280
Jack and Espace dev we've got the clock

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:31,930
University the st2 PHA - poly

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:38,370
development of the terminology medical a

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:41,440
veteran ere the laters being either in

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,450
research centres the Association

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,460
illiberal show graph and mappers from

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,639
the Association OpenStreetMap Ivory

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:52,889
Coast the funding is through the French

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:57,330
national research agency and basically

00:05:52,889 --> 00:06:00,070
cohesion is a else geography project

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:03,280
tackling malaria and seeking to

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,130
understand better through Malaya o the

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,340
city form itself and how the forming of

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:11,530
the cities and the differences that

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:14,680
appears that translate into inequalities

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:19,210
have an importance in terms of Public

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,820
Health so what's going to be unfold on

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,220
the geographical component of cohesions

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:29,380
will be not surprisingly open data

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:34,180
creations using satellite imageries and

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:37,060
remote mapping tied to creation on the

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,279
field using another thing all the tools

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:51,069
available for

00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:55,659
OpenStreetMap but mainly mainly osm SMI

00:06:51,069 --> 00:07:01,359
and ASM tracker up data kids as well as

00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:05,409
mapillary and all the data are created

00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:07,869
through collisions that are geographical

00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:12,399
data are not tied to individual are

00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:15,249
going to be shared via the various means

00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,949
of sharing data that exists in

00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:21,339
OpenStreetMap but on top of that data

00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:27,329
will be contributed to a special data

00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:31,329
infrastructure based on geolocation and

00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:34,779
managed by lady Bellagio graph as well

00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:37,599
as the human data platform managed by

00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:43,929
the United coordination for humanitarian

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:47,259
efforts a good deal of data analysis are

00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:52,139
going to be run to carry out the various

00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:55,839
circles and phases of of work and target

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,569
essentially the Ria's were further

00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,309
investigations on biomedical and social

00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,829
sciences are going to be carried out

00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:08,249
during the project's life of four years

00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:14,399
and of course analysis will be run to

00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:19,319
identify patterns about various else and

00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:22,659
social aspects of of malaria data

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:26,139
visualization will be there and what's

00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:28,989
going to be new in in this in this

00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:32,500
project will be the attention around

00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:35,019
training and capacity building both

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:40,539
internal within the consumption team but

00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:42,990
also towards any actors active in Bakke

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,480
starting with people in charge of us

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:56,050
starting in charge of

00:08:46,480 --> 00:09:00,070
the social the the management of of the

00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:02,200
city and various associations and NGOs

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,210
that are working there in terms of

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,030
scientific valorisation on top of

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:13,360
classic stuffs like talks in conference

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:19,390
and publications of articles we will

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:22,540
kick off a open science lab and gets

00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:26,080
community actions growing so that's

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,240
what's going to be unfold throughout

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,560
this project of research with

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:36,160
OpenStreetMap I talked the next two

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,010
years or three years there will be four

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,560
phases of mainly three phases of work a

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:45,040
yob and geographical survey that's

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:50,470
happened in early spring in ivory coast

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:54,130
in black' then there will be a very

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,290
thorough entomological and social

00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:59,020
sciences surveys that will that will

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:02,050
happen at two distinct moments in times

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:06,390
and all the way through the project

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:09,690
there will be a constant actions around

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:14,860
capacity-building trainings and also

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:17,950
scientific valorisation so what we can

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:22,180
say at the moment about the impact of

00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:28,620
that project after having conducted the

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:30,910
first phase of of survey involving

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,300
people that have been trained around

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:38,560
OpenStreetMap in Bakke and an in Abidjan

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:41,350
and mapped the entire city of Baku which

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:45,330
is the second city in ivory coast of

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:51,520
total of populations of 1.2 or 3 million

00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:55,060
people is that the project delivered

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,910
really on capacity building with 20

00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:05,310
participants highly trained with

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:08,410
all the technicalities of using

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:12,970
OpenStreetMap tools for data creations

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:14,830
and remotely or on the grounds and

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,440
they've been doing that in various roles

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:20,200
they've been doing that as surveyors but

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,610
also as co-facilitators for animators

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,820
and they've been associated to the

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:31,120
making of the project specifically all

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:35,370
the decisions that have been made in

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:40,210
terms of framing the approach building

00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:43,900
the data outreach building the data

00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:46,120
models and thinking ahead of all the

00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,640
analysis that we're going to be mad with

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:54,510
the data in the various phases of work

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:57,160
of that project in terms of open data a

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,960
comprehensive reference a set of

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:04,480
comprehensive reference data that have

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:09,910
been created over breaking mainly all

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,280
the buildings that showed in the free

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,040
imagery available for tracing in

00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,970
OpenStreetMap have been mapped for the

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,370
walled city all else education and

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:24,970
government structures of the city have

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:29,830
been extensively mapped as well as what

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:33,040
points all collective and and community

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:37,440
watch points places of worships and

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:40,810
markets places in terms of outreach

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,670
outreach and partnerships since the very

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:47,290
beginning of the project in the kickoff

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:54,490
meeting local governments have been

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:56,620
brought in as well as people from two

00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:59,740
directorates both at the region and at

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:03,250
the department practitioners that have

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:07,269
been part of the three weeks training

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:12,769
that take place and prepare the

00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:16,899
for weeks survey of the city the next

00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:19,660
steps on the geographical package is

00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:22,399
about it

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:25,610
managing better the data that has been

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:30,079
created so that reference data sets can

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:33,740
be shared over the two SDI the one

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:37,339
managed by le Piaf around jaw orchestra

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:46,310
and the human data platform managed by

00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:49,250
the HDX project of un OCHA imagery is

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:53,300
going to be a quiet and very fresh

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:57,680
imagery high resolutions so project is

00:13:53,300 --> 00:14:01,699
is ongoing on that France and remote

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:05,750
sensing work is being done using a chi

00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:08,389
of imagery available for the project via

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:11,560
a collaboration with me omelette le

00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:17,060
detection in Montpellier in France and

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:20,959
one of the main GIS young researcher of

00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:24,500
the project is going to work for three

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:27,709
months in Montpellier building up his

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:34,490
skills around collecting data with

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:38,360
drones and manipulating imagery with

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,269
folks from Maison Litella detection we

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,980
are working on project that are similar

00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:51,110
to cohesion in other areas of of the

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:53,930
world some special analysis are going it

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:57,110
should be carried out using the base

00:14:53,930 --> 00:15:00,230
layers data are created as well as the

00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:03,920
results from remote sensing so that we

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:06,050
can identify the four areas where

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,100
further investigations are going to be

00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:14,460
carried out on biomedical and social

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:18,780
sciences approach and perspectives

00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:24,150
and we also voted to start kicking of

00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:27,630
the open science animation lab that that

00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:30,600
will that is part of the project to

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:33,330
innovate of more impacts both in terms

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,440
of capacity building but also as well in

00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:40,410
terms of scientific variations so I

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,670
guess that this is it for a snapshot on

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:48,350
cohesion which if we want to sum up as a

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:51,480
project that allows to answer the needs

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:56,850
in terms of geographical informations

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:59,670
but also training skills for a research

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:03,060
unit which wants to do research with an

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:06,990
impact in terms of concrete development

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:09,990
deliverables beyond data and the way

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,480
that we have been able to do that is to

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,450
on us on a long history of cooperations

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:21,960
between IRD and the OpenStreetMap

00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:25,440
ecosystems in ivory coast so that all

00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:28,290
the unfolding of the this research

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,320
project all the decisions in terms of

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:35,640
what to do what data to collect how to

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,800
use it to address that specific needs

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,560
which methodology everything is passed

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:45,060
to the team of mappers that are part of

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:48,930
of the project and that this is also

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:54,000
done with the main GIS actors that are

00:16:48,930 --> 00:17:00,030
active in working at associations or NGO

00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,520
or within the government so that's it

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:05,550
if there is an equations we're good for

00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,530
that otherwise we can also move to the

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,040
second part of that last component of

00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,040
the track

00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:32,860
do you have a website for the project

00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:35,050
question no website yet it's being built

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:38,830
within the consortium but there will be

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:41,560
a web presence with informations on the

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,960
project and as well access to the

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:47,100
various work components and web packages

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,100
