Title: The state of public transport routing
Publication date: 2016-10-21

Many public transit route planning interfaces exist for public transit route planning as open source, as a software as a service, or as end-user applications. GTFS has become the de facto standard for exchanging public transit timetables, yet the glue between these GTFS files (for example providing transfer times and footpaths) is a map layer such as OpenStreetMap.

The workshop, organised by members of the Open Transport working group at Open Knowledge International, will discuss the state of the art and the next steps within public transit route planning.

	00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:08,639
so hello everyone welcome to the session

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,179
on the state of public transit's routing

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,009
on openstreetmap so if you're wrong you

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,160
can if you're wrong you can still change

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,100
this everyone is here yeah okay first I

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,460
have a question for you like don't have

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:27,300
to answer it right away but how far do

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,300
you live from work keep the answer in

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,920
your head right I know I want to ask you

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,050
a question on the units that you used

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,890
was it raise your hand if it was in

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:41,550
kilometers okay and raise your hand if

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,700
it was in time like minutes and this is

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,920
really interesting because if you know

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,430
because about fifty percent said hey

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,620
yeah it was in minute if you now want to

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,989
want to create a program a computer

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,489
program that does this calculation for

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,190
you for instance if you want to check

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,129
out where you want to live next or if

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,750
you want to check out your next job then

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,680
then you want this kind of calculations

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,799
and just imagine the amount of data that

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,659
you would need in order to to get to an

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,189
answer to that and it's not only osm

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,830
data that's that's the interesting part

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,780
it's also data about public transit

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,759
schedules but also data about

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,009
criminality rates for instance because I

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,320
don't want to want my eternally to

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,180
always go through through through places

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,890
that that have a high criminality rate

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,960
and so on so for this session you will

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,320
have we will have three interventions

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,479
first the first one will be by three

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,430
strand grabner the second one will be by

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:47,159
to kaha strip and the next one will be

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:52,740
by Emily errors so i would say without

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,240
further ado system I and afterwards we

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,399
will have a panel so you can also

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,520
prepare questions for this panel we will

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,450
keep all the questions for after the

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,450
three talks yeah

00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:13,099
thank you Peter so I will talk about

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:20,769
just a plain or CSV file and the context

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:24,380
is I used to on which train does it

00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:29,750
which computers linked this one this one

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:31,190
to go oh thank you and I used to work

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,220
for a company that changed a bit of a

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,810
name captain clown which wasn't

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,380
international nuts it became captain

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,790
train and it was bought recently by

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:46,069
train line so it's during a Europe and

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,160
what they do is they are connected to

00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:51,140
different booking systems so the four

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,380
biggest a Deutsche Bahn is in CF in

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:58,370
Italian envy but also for smaller train

00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:01,400
operators like the private etl or h KX

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,950
other subsidies like we go and ettv

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,040
which are having different booking

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:11,090
systems so the idea is to distribute any

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,510
train ticket to just one web page or one

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:17,329
application and especially have

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,670
worldwide by far the best customer

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:26,390
service and I'm saying that even if I

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:31,299
don't work there anymore so we needed a

00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:33,319
station database so multiple reasons so

00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,319
openstreetmap you always think of a map

00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,930
so we need a coordinate use that for Joe

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,980
fencing so if you get at the station you

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:46,519
get a notification ok your booking is a

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,069
car number four seat number 26 so when

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,620
you get in on the station you know your

00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:55,489
platform everything you need to travel

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:57,950
well of course maps and to find the for

00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:01,880
booking from the new station to say some

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:04,190
time but also every booking system I

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,870
showed we they have like seven or eight

00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,489
different booking systems and a few

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,910
other in progress they all have

00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:13,519
different identifiers for every station

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,220
so if you want to book a train ticket

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,890
from Paris to

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,299
Curren ova brussels you have two

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,550
different companies and blossom doesn't

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:27,050
have the same identifier so the database

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:29,150
draws also this information and we have

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,590
also some very specific metadata to know

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,450
if you can get your ticket at the

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,220
station or you need an office or send it

00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:40,730
by mail and things like that so we use

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,270
different data sources well first

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:47,660
carriers have some open data databases

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:51,320
we used openstreetmap the partners gave

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:55,100
us different files and we made a lot of

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,290
internal crowdsourcing because we didn't

00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,230
have any coordinate for every regional

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,260
bus we sell and we wanted to have the

00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:07,040
coordinate so we made some application

00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,380
to map that so obviously the databases

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,680
in Oh dbl because less in safe database

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,260
to dbl with street map is OD BL and the

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:20,180
other ones agreed to republish it in

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:24,350
Libyan so basically it's just a csv file

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,510
in on github and it's quite active so

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,190
they're about 600 commits and every

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,890
commit is activating this activating a

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,120
station dreams are the name fixing

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:39,410
translations activating dis activating

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:41,090
adding new identifiers and when

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,729
interesting thing is as we put it on

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,790
github we have quite extensive unit

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:49,130
testing with tons of different rules to

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:55,040
see if it's coherent if the coordinates

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:57,919
are not somewhere near null island or if

00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,680
the name already exists or a student

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:05,300
have identifiers match and we always

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:09,410
work by poor requests because it's not

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:12,800
always clear if this station belongs to

00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,540
brussels let's say the nearest station

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,450
on how you process it I back or

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,820
something like that if you type brussels

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,979
should you also try to book a ticket

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,990
from that station or not and this kind

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:28,110
of things we make pull request and we

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:31,740
comment this openly so

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,930
and at last we made some tool which was

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,490
green shot right now so I think the very

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,590
interesting part of this project is

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,530
really the data is very minimalistic

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:42,630
could be initially it was a SQL database

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,390
but they didn't allow to make poor

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,710
request which were quite important do

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,460
you know the history who made this

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:54,200
change and we can ask why he made it and

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:57,060
unit testing saved our asses many times

00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:01,770
because we went too fast or somebody

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,660
changed something without knowing the

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:09,390
consequence consequences with other

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:12,810
carriers so yeah this is quite

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:15,720
interesting approach I think having this

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:19,200
data and using developer tools to

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,840
manipulate it so because everybody is

00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,360
not a developer we made an user

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,990
interface like this which is like a huge

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:31,380
phone with while I think 20 possible

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,570
values and you can see if I them to the

00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,740
identifier for the Deutsche Bahn renfe

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:39,210
or the UAC international Weiwei

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,040
organization there's almost the same but

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,190
not completely so this is kind of things

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,550
we have to manage on a daily basis and

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:52,170
the map allows to correct the position

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:55,410
of the stations because nearly all

00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:58,680
station were wrong on small city because

00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:01,830
it was made on the on the town hall and

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,170
not on the station on big a station it

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,060
was off by wasn't a century to the

00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:09,230
station and not on the passenger

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:15,120
building what we interested in and so on

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:19,380
and to go back to the original team so

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:22,080
we used openstreetmap coordinate and it

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:26,580
would be great to push it back but it's

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,730
not that easy one reason is what is the

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,980
station we made very strong assumptions

00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:38,310
that is really the passenger building

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:41,560
and openstreetmap sometimes maps just

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:45,460
top points I'm thinking of a bus stop

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:49,060
which is run by a which has national

00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,590
wide transportation sometimes the bus

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,200
stop is mapped on both sides of the

00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,600
street which when we sell a train ticket

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,850
it's not interesting we just want to

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,690
give one name for this station and not

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:03,730
the poor where you get off on and off so

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,710
the matting between those is difficult

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,370
so it should it's a work that should be

00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:11,080
done almost line by line by hand and

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:14,010
well you know you get carried away by

00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,480
other priorities and we didn't do it so

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,700
one answers to say hey it's open dated

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,600
with yourself of course not an exit or

00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:25,570
reason but must be done and then there's

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,400
a question how do we extend it to all

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,740
the public transit a natural way way

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,930
station because of extremely few

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,890
stations in Europe like 30,000 or

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:37,330
something like that and it's not even

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,460
the number station that is in the Perry

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:43,270
area if you take all the buses and so on

00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:45,460
and make the decision of the station the

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:50,980
stop point is very important if you want

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:53,680
to go from subway to the bus so it's a

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:59,140
lot of work too so I have no clear

00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:01,690
answer how that could be done and it's

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:07,180
always a recurring theme theme of making

00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:10,720
a station database that project in every

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:13,900
country sometimes state-backed sometime

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,880
not but nothing really emerges here so I

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,070
don't know if other people in certain

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,020
public transit and openstreetmap have an

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,970
idea how this could be done and how we

00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,209
could have this data bases of all the

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:30,459
stop point stop areas and stations so

00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:32,820
just some things to think about it thank

00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,820
you very much

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,990
so the next speaker will be two cajas

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,420
trip from from Finland who claim to be

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,209
very advanced in public transport route

00:10:45,420 --> 00:11:02,190
planning and mobility as a service let's

00:10:48,209 --> 00:11:05,300
see whether that's true yeah I think

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:09,209
some of that is like what our government

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,670
wants the reality to be and then we are

00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:17,519
working towards that maybe not quite

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:21,930
there yet but thanks feature so um yeah

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:27,269
I'm from Helsinki region hsl the public

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:32,399
authority there and yeah so we don't

00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:34,440
operate the public transport companies

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,740
do that and we don't hire bus drivers

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,560
and so on but we organize the lines the

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,040
IT systems needed for our ticketing and

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:49,350
passenger information and this covers

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:53,550
all the regional traffic so Massa strums

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,290
metros so on and just to give you an

00:11:53,550 --> 00:12:01,050
idea of what kind of a region is this so

00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:02,699
around 1.3 million inhabitants and quite

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:07,310
a lot of public transport using that

00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:10,260
there's 1,000,000 boardings per day and

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:13,170
to give you some kind of idea of most of

00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:16,709
the lines are our bus lines and more

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:20,220
than 300 of them to take care and a new

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:22,709
addition is this city bikes which is

00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,260
still a small system but similar to what

00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:29,279
you can see here and it's proven very

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:34,350
popular and increasing the use of bikes

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:37,500
in in general so our current journey

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,180
planner um to give you an idea people

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:45,560
love it we've had it for a long time

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:48,329
already and so we give you an objective

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,129
measurement of how much they love it is

00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:54,370
we do these questionnaires where they

00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:58,870
are asked whether they would suggest

00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:02,829
their friends to use use our or web

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:06,910
application and the recommendation score

00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:10,660
is more than fifty percent wear anything

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:14,949
that would be positive is seen as a good

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:17,949
result so really people have not much to

00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:20,350
complain about it I'm part of it is

00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:23,379
because we provide open data and open

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,139
api's so if someone is not happy with

00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:28,870
our one user interface then there's tens

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:31,300
of mobile applications that people can

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,279
choose from if you're an Apple user you

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,259
can find a nice Apple application if

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:40,139
your Android user in tonight's Android

00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:45,490
applications pebble pebble watch

00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:48,970
interfaces and so on here's an example

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:52,990
of wanting to show your map so from a

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:55,930
fan he designed a better schematic map

00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:59,230
landed and the official one gives you an

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:02,290
idea of the we have only one subway line

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,629
but then the commuter rail and some of

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:08,860
the trunk bus lines form something of a

00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:12,490
subway subway a network of this small

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:17,199
small city of of only around or a bit

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:20,079
over 1 million people and what problems

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:23,319
we have with the old system which had

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,879
which had closed data so there's a long

00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:27,850
list and I don't think it please

00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,569
everything just starting the problem

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,769
thinking of when we pay for the data

00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:35,709
we're trying to be as efficient as

00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:38,110
possible so we try to use as little data

00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,750
as possible whereas the best service

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:44,129
would be the one that took advantage of

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:47,259
as much data as as this available and

00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:50,259
it's fragmented it's crazy amount of

00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:55,569
work to up yeah

00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:58,089
so um it's this fragmented data sets

00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:59,529
combining them and when the data sets

00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:04,209
are updated you have to do the manual

00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:06,389
combining again so our region covers six

00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:09,129
different municipalities so they have

00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:15,239
different data sets and they are not

00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:18,879
even comparable in formats and so on and

00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:21,879
still it's incomplete so we need to add

00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,009
working parts which are important for

00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:27,399
public transport users but are not

00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:32,379
included in these database database is

00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:34,749
that we have used this far and it's slow

00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:37,629
to update so these sources typically

00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:39,939
they update once or twice a year and

00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:43,479
then we do the manual processing and so

00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:45,279
on so when you are housing is built for

00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:48,999
instance it takes a long long while

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,399
before before we can route there unless

00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:54,399
we do the manual work of adding

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:59,769
temporary approximate geometries for

00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:01,749
these paths and so on yeah and still

00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:03,970
still there's some things that we

00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:05,919
haven't managed to do manually that we

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,009
should have so for instance the mapping

00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:12,279
of exact working parts to all the 8,000

00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,629
stops that's not something that we could

00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:16,239
really do so then there's this

00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:18,609
inaccuracies of how long is the work

00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:25,899
really between two bus stops for

00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:28,629
instance and yeah the base map is is

00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,730
again another data source so actually it

00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:35,919
doesn't necessarily match what we show

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:39,609
as a road for the user to take and in

00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:43,869
the end with all these open data and ApS

00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:45,609
from ourselves we can't share along the

00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,859
data that we use to calculate the route

00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:50,350
so all these other applications then

00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:52,539
they typically display on top of for

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,419
instance google maps maps and it doesn't

00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:58,499
exactly match argument geometry so it

00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:58,499
creates confusion

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,780
so the result our answer that we are now

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:09,189
working on is called digit transit it's

00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:12,370
now in in beta integrating all your

00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:16,750
travel information is is the idea for

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:18,490
the customer and in the back end it's

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:24,089
supposed to be all one hundred percent

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:24,089
open so open data open source open api's

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:32,320
yeah so the schedules are in what we

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:35,580
provide us open data in this standard

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:41,230
GTFS format which is simple and nice and

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:43,929
then we call positions estimates of the

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,299
arrivals to the stops and alert

00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,490
regarding disruptions we provide in

00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:51,039
various real-time formats so there's a

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,230
couple of big standards Syrian GTFS

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:57,130
real-time and we try to support both of

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:59,350
them then addresses we take from open

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,210
street map unfortunately in Finland the

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,520
situation isn't so good that we would

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,409
have it would be enough to use addresses

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:10,780
from open street map so then in addition

00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:13,299
we use the government published page set

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,940
that covers all of Finland which is

00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:21,039
integrated into open addresses that IL

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:24,429
database and yeah in addition we use

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:29,679
who's on first for the municipality and

00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:32,200
locality and so on lots of place names

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,700
that are not yet in open street so this

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,700
these are then combined for the

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:41,700
geocoding functionalities and new API is

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:45,700
that we provide now we can provide the

00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:48,669
raster tiles for the base map but then

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,320
also vector child's so if someone wants

00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,370
to style them separately in their app

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,990
then they can still use our or ipi

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,640
there's also some other data so for

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,030
instance the stops are provided as

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:04,919
vector tiles so it's more efficient

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:08,350
better caching and so on compared to

00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:10,530
acquiring by bounding box from a REST

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,530
API

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,570
then we use this quite new API

00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:21,139
technology called growth ql which makes

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:24,110
it possible to make all kinds of queries

00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:26,869
from for instance mobile applications a

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:29,659
REST API can mean that you have to do

00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:32,299
lots of queries to display one page or

00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:35,749
on the other hand it may be very fixed

00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:39,139
to only show the predetermined set of

00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:42,679
information instead here you describe a

00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:46,940
query it's it's kind of limited it's not

00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:53,980
SQL so it doesn't open up us to all

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:57,919
kinds of denial of service type of use

00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:01,220
some limits but still it's very useful

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,350
in practice and then for real-time data

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:07,220
push we use this new standard called

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:10,249
MQTT where a mobile device can the

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,649
application can subscribe to a specific

00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:17,749
set of information for instance whenever

00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:22,190
a vehicle on line number 550 moves send

00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:23,720
me an information right away so the

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,360
mobile applications don't have to keep

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,909
pulling for four movements instead they

00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,059
can wait for for movement information to

00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:36,320
come to them and all these combined mean

00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:40,159
that there's no this buzzword of being

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:44,619
server less so it's possible or already

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,730
two to create these public transport

00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:49,240
applications without having your own

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:51,980
server so then it's popular with

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,440
students and hobbyists to also create

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,970
these applications without having to

00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:04,690
have their own server taking advantage

00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:04,690
of our growth qln MQTT platform

00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:15,049
then for for open source we use various

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:20,090
components and try to try to contribute

00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:22,250
to upstream so our own own user

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:26,779
interface that's what we did from from

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:29,480
scratch but based on html5 react user

00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:34,429
interface library leaflet for maps of

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:37,159
course vivek for analytics and century

00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:41,409
for error situations so these are all

00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:43,880
all open source components and services

00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:45,919
then open trip planner is what we

00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,750
actually use for calculating these

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:53,149
public transport routes also we this

00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:55,760
graphically api we contributed there and

00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:58,730
it's now included in the one point 0

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,130
release that that happened recently i'll

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:04,039
talk a bit more about what all open trip

00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:06,889
planner provides later but it's been

00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,080
very i would say this project wouldn't

00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:12,409
have been possible if open trip planner

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:17,019
didn't exist already provided us a great

00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:21,200
foundation then yeah young geocoding

00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:23,210
using velius trying to contribute to

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,330
make it the best best geocode or for

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,330
finland I'm optimistic that we will we

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:31,000
will get there it's been a bit difficult

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,480
some remaining internal

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,200
internationalization and localization

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:44,240
work work needed there yeah base maps

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:49,549
then using osm to vector tiles and our

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,950
own style based on osm right and we also

00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:55,399
publish in github the doctor deployment

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:57,260
script so it's actually quite easy to to

00:22:55,399 --> 00:23:00,110
spin it up for instance on your on your

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:04,580
own laptop to to have a test on all of

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:08,029
the system then there's this this bit is

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:10,850
still not open so the font we use is not

00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:13,760
openly licensed and likewise for our our

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,130
logo but everything else you can make up

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,290
almost

00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:22,120
one hundred percent copy of our service

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:24,070
then tailor your own version of it so

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,800
here's an example of what it looks like

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:30,070
when you open it so obviously we try to

00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,950
geo locate where you are so we can give

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:36,040
you the context and often this works and

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:38,440
this may be all that you need so journey

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,300
planning traditionally has meant typing

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,310
in where you want to start and where you

00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,410
want to go but actually actually the

00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:49,330
information you might need might be here

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:51,790
already okay the the pink circle shows

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,100
me where I am and I can see the train

00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:57,130
station nearby and I can find my way

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,290
there and find my train if I already

00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:05,770
knew that I wanted to take the train for

00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:07,420
instance if the geolocation fails for

00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,370
instance that's why we show the proper

00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:13,240
pop up in the center so you can tap

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:17,080
there and do a geocoding for starting

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,050
from another origin point so here's for

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,690
instance I change it to do economy to

00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:26,170
show another area and this is a better

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:29,380
image in that here you can see all the

00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:32,140
different that the color circles are the

00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:35,140
stops and you can tap any stop to see

00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,060
the next departures from this stop if

00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,610
you already know which stop you wanted

00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,470
to use you still don't have to type in

00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:45,190
anything which is very practical for

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:48,130
mobile users then you from the bottom

00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:50,980
you can open these tabs so if you're not

00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:52,870
interested in viewing information on a

00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,420
map instead you want textual information

00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:59,640
so this is like your private departure

00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:01,930
board concentrated on the origin showing

00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,300
closest lines and they're in next

00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:07,990
departures this is often what you want

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:10,780
to see from real time real time system

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:14,050
you might have these on bus stops but

00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:17,080
for instance we can't have a display for

00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:19,210
all the 8,000 stops so then this works

00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:23,080
as well and a virtual version of that

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:27,210
also works for people with visual

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:29,950
impairments or or so on

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:32,500
then the other tab is your favorites so

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:35,110
if the list of lines was 22 along there

00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,480
then if you have marked your favorite

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:41,740
routes and destinations and so on you

00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:44,140
can probably already see the information

00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,300
you want it to see what's the closest

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:52,060
stop for the line that i always take

00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:53,890
home from center for instance then we

00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,530
can show real time information so when

00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,810
you click on on one of the departures we

00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:01,390
can show where it's arriving so you know

00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:05,050
if it already went past your stop or

00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:08,860
where where is when you're waiting you

00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:11,140
can see that approaching slowly or you

00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,970
can view the whole not just one Wiegel

00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,660
but all the vehicles on the same routes

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:18,460
to see whether you could catch the

00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:22,900
previous one or maybe you want to spend

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:26,470
more time and catch the next one then

00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:28,510
when you have given the destination then

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,610
we can calculate these routes using open

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,740
trip planner and display the results so

00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,590
at the bottom you see three different

00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:38,650
suggestions regarding what might be your

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:42,430
favorite option of these and then

00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:45,700
showing also on the map whether when you

00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:47,590
go around whether you go from north or

00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:51,510
south for instance here just to give you

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:57,550
some idea where your suggested to to go

00:26:51,510 --> 00:27:00,130
which way and then we can show the inner

00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:02,080
areas these instructions this is still

00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:04,390
something to work on would be really

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,580
nice to throw nice walking directions

00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:09,400
where you have to turn and so on but

00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:13,210
we've had some some issues with this so

00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:15,370
for instance the sidewalks often don't

00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,380
include the name of the street so it

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:20,290
would mean need some kind of pre or post

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,450
processing to add the names of the names

00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:26,470
of the streets to the instructions so

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:32,040
currently you only see the geometry of

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:32,040
the walking path visual

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,419
regarding current coverage so we do

00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:42,549
Helsinki region and then it's a 50-50

00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:46,179
collaboration with the finish Transport

00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:47,799
Agency which covers like all of

00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:49,840
Finland's are also including the

00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:52,600
long-distance buses and trains and so on

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,330
and then there's this new consortium of

00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:58,480
all the other finished cities they have

00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:01,000
a travel card we called wealthy together

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,539
and then they are working on bringing up

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,029
like localized versions of these two to

00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:09,330
each city then we collaborate with

00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:12,340
Norway they wanted to do an national

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:15,730
journey planner as well and they found

00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:18,250
our work to be a good starting point for

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:22,120
for their work as well and then there's

00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:26,080
some more more informal work so for

00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:30,279
instance this one operator in in South

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:33,610
Tirol in Italy already started to to

00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:37,390
deploy this as a test for their their

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:40,570
new information system and and there's

00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:42,429
them hopefully it's one EU project now

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,730
I'm going and maybe more in the future

00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:50,770
to to bring this well first to to tell

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:52,539
in in this term yeah so some were

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,640
details about open trip planner if

00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:57,700
you're not familiar with it already I

00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:02,020
think it's less known compared to OS RM

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:04,720
because currently no one provides lots

00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:08,200
of public instances of it so you would

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,059
need to install your own for your region

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,539
and of course it's not enough to have

00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:16,510
only open stream of data if you want to

00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:18,490
do public transport protein as well but

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,679
the nice things are that you can do

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,230
these multimodal combinations so first

00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:25,210
you works to the bus stop and then you

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:29,730
take a train and then maybe in the

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:34,299
center you use a city bike for the last

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:37,230
kilometer or so and the eye takes care

00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:41,340
of elevators escalators

00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:43,620
so on including car or first driving to

00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,470
the station using your own car and it's

00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,580
very flexible there's lots of

00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:51,059
configuration you can do when you do the

00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:53,100
routing requests for instance for

00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:56,640
bicycles you can say whether you want a

00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:59,880
short route or one that has not many

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,490
hills or one that is safe in that you

00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:09,240
don't have to buy it up among cars and

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:11,970
so on and interestingly we're following

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:15,000
this work on the project called r 5

00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:18,750
which is by the developers original

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,440
developers of open trip planner creating

00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:25,799
a next generation which is faster and

00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:28,350
lighter so it should be more more viable

00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:32,990
to run this for instance on on a mobile

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,990
phone for completely offline usage

00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:42,820
and I'm thinking what this kind of use

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:46,960
case brings to brings to openstreetmap I

00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:51,100
think I'm very optimistic that it will

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:56,260
provide new new users for openstreetmap

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:59,380
and more more exposure because people

00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:02,470
want to go places so they need some way

00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:04,510
and currently Open Street Map latorte

00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:07,090
front page doesn't give you the option

00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:11,380
of public transport so people are forced

00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:14,279
to use something else maybe someday we

00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:19,169
will have a solution that we can deploy

00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:22,029
globally for for all of openstreetmap

00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:26,070
and I already noticed that we are

00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:28,960
raising awareness we are one government

00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:32,049
project then we talk to other

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,120
departments for instance they ask us why

00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:36,220
we don't use their map data and we

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,269
explain how how open street map is

00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:45,039
better for for some use cases and so on

00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:47,139
and yeah we can already see it and of

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,240
course where more people use

00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:51,549
openstreetmap the maps are of better

00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,789
quality so we hope to bring a lot of

00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:56,860
more users especially in the national

00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:59,370
version he'll think it coverage in

00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:02,380
OpenStreetMap is already so good but

00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:05,529
more use in the countryside hopefully

00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:11,169
leads to more contributors from the

00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:14,620
countryside and and we are planning to

00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:17,169
do some mapping work of our own as well

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:20,320
so some things that are missing and that

00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:23,289
are important for us then the you the

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:27,429
work that we did earlier to to keep a

00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:31,149
kind of a private amendments to the

00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:32,730
available data sets in the future we can

00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:35,730
contribute them directly to

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,730
openstreetmap

00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:47,120
just to give a wish to wish list of of

00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:50,910
what kind of problems we've seen so far

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,670
it feels at least in in Helsinki that

00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:59,520
the community isn't so so wide and

00:32:53,670 --> 00:33:02,310
inclusive so the hot project has already

00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:10,260
with their methadones I think given a

00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:13,920
nice boost in multiplying the amount of

00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:16,500
active my person people who who know

00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:20,490
about our mystery man who are

00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,930
participating in the events then it's a

00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,330
good question whether we should have

00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:27,660
something like our own namespace when we

00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:29,880
disagree with the OpenStreetMap

00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:32,160
consensus on something for instance

00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,130
whether you can where they are allowed

00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,780
or whether it's wise to walk somewhere

00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:40,770
we think that you shouldn't walk at

00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:44,040
someone's backyard but if the community

00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:47,910
things otherwise we cannot changed that

00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:50,250
but still may be our official during

00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:53,520
runner suggestions shouldn't tell you to

00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,860
to walk in in someone's backyard so one

00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:59,070
idea that that we have come across as

00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:02,010
this maybe we can add this kind of our

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:04,860
point of view I know it's not it's not

00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:08,460
objective and it's not maybe round it on

00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:10,320
on on the objective reality but this

00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:14,429
might be a kind of compromise we could

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,550
make then there's some of these

00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:21,720
questions about our data sets which are

00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:24,960
not copy left and then Oh dbl how to how

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:29,850
to make the separation clear so

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:32,610
currently we first produce the GTFS data

00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:34,950
and then afterwards we match it with

00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:39,120
OpenStreetMap data so this way we have

00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:43,730
both one set which is not copy left and

00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:46,050
then the after matching we have the

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:48,349
version where the geometry is much

00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,940
nicely to openstreetmap and then

00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:53,720
probably be a licensed and not

00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:57,980
appropriate for all kinds of uses are

00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:01,170
all kinds of licensing scenarios anymore

00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:04,890
so it would be nice if it was all clear

00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:06,480
to everyone what is calculated and what

00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:12,770
is not and what is allowed and what is

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:15,900
not yeah there is a no ongoing import of

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:18,240
government open data Finland white from

00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,700
the National land survey of Finland but

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,740
it's being progressing quite slowly been

00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,079
ongoing for several years already and

00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:29,670
I'm not sure how to how to speed it up

00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:31,530
maybe with all the new openstreetmap

00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:37,319
contributors from Finland we can set up

00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:42,839
some kind of countrywide hackathons or

00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:46,050
moccasins to do in improve the import

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,329
work and finally there's been some

00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:52,230
interesting discussions here now and

00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:55,319
talks about how the indoor work is

00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:58,230
progressing and we are very excited

00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:00,720
about that in the public transport side

00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:02,730
with the stations for instance I think

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,559
one part of why they are not mapped as

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,619
good as they could be is just because

00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:11,099
it's so difficult trying to view all the

00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:14,940
different levels of the station as a

00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:20,549
flat flat visualization in ID editor

00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:23,430
pressures so yeah thanks and there are

00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:27,059
some links for for the resources also a

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:30,530
demo of what this looks like in in

00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,530
Belgium if you want to test it

00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:44,670
thank you very much Tuukka so yeah I

00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,100
think what you've shown here is like

00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,900
really what we can do with open data

00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,680
today with with open source software

00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:55,080
today and and yes we are quite there

00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,240
right like everything is almost fixed

00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,160
everyone with a budget at least a

00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,380
certain budget like from the government

00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,270
of Finland if you have you have your own

00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,160
government and if you can actually also

00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:07,590
a secure a budget you can set this up

00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,170
and you can have a decent for the

00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:13,410
transit route planner so that's why I'm

00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:17,700
also really happy to do to do to have

00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:23,100
the next speaker who's going to do to

00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:28,500
get the other side of the middle unless

00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:30,630
tall we're good so I'm actually my name

00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,670
is Emily heiress I'm the GIS team lead

00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,140
at the American Red Cross but in my past

00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,420
life I'm actually trained as an urban

00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,790
planner and specifically worked on open

00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,580
data for informal transit in developing

00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:44,130
countries I'm going to slide free today

00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,780
because when Peter said panel I didn't

00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:49,560
think presentation and i happen to be

00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,390
laptop free so you guys are going to

00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:55,320
have to give me your rapt attention and

00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:57,240
also imaginations one thing that I found

00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,820
really interesting being here at state

00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,760
of the map is that in my work context I

00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,170
work with collecting data for

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,970
settlements in real West Africa or

00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:08,220
Rwanda or countries all around the world

00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,960
where we have to send somebody to walk

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,250
10 kilometers just to get the name of

00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,130
the village and put that into

00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,080
openstreetmap for the first time at the

00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,000
same time I'm hearing from SNCF in

00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,860
France who is collecting the location of

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,650
every single clock in every train

00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:25,770
station in their whole country and it's

00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:27,660
it's in and you know osm has so many use

00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,610
cases and it's amazing to me that we

00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:32,370
have a platform that can meet all of

00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:34,290
those needs at the same time and it's

00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,000
exciting to see how passionate everyone

00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:39,870
is about their particular use case

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,280
because they're equally important so my

00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,890
back

00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,620
is informal transit which works a little

00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:47,540
bit differently and Peter asked me to be

00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,190
on this panel just so that as we're

00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,630
thinking about you know areas where we

00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:53,150
can have real time transit information

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:55,550
we're also keeping in mind places where

00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,080
there is no transit information or not

00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:00,620
publicly available or held by the

00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:03,440
government so in the past I worked on

00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:06,140
data collection projects both for MIT in

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,680
the World Bank where we collected route

00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:12,530
information for dhaka bangladesh nairobi

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,910
in mexico city and we're able to send

00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,340
out students using different apps

00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,540
there's transit one there's block

00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,040
tracker there's a there's a bunch of

00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,900
different apps out there that you can

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,300
use to collect your GPS traces as

00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,610
volunteers go out turn those into shape

00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,500
files compare those two osm and then

00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:29,810
create paper-based transit maps for the

00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,630
first time if you've seen the map anika

00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:34,520
project from Managua those guys were

00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,900
doing a very similar thing but what's

00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,790
really exciting about their project is

00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:40,400
it's the first example I've seen of one

00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:41,780
that's crowd-sourced and locally led the

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,150
others have usually been outside

00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,970
institutions coming in so those guys are

00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,380
fantastic but what informal transit

00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:51,320
tends to look like is a much more

00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:53,360
decentralized version of what we have so

00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,200
rather than a centralized transit agency

00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,370
operating different routes this is

00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,620
multiple private companies sometimes

00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,330
hundreds of private companies who have a

00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:05,480
franchise or the permit to operate a

00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:08,390
particular route and in that context

00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,830
data is power what I found from working

00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,410
with these agencies is they tend to have

00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:14,900
very very good information about exactly

00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:17,630
where their buses run but it's not

00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,790
available so in Mexico City if you go to

00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,100
ask the government world the colectivos

00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,750
run they'll say yes yes we have it but

00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,870
if you keep asking you find that there's

00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:28,550
a binder stacks of paper that hasn't

00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:31,910
been updated in 10 years and all it says

00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:34,520
is roughly a destination and roughly the

00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:37,220
origin and that's all you get and these

00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,600
are systems that in Mexico City informal

00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,660
transit is sixty percent of the

00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:45,320
rideshare this is 14 million person

00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,540
trips per day and really very little

00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,850
information about where what does this

00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:52,080
actually operate so as soon as you start

00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:53,700
thinking about how do we introduce

00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,380
like in Bangladesh they're thinking

00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,060
about how do we introduce mats transit

00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,460
for the first time how do we introduce a

00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:01,380
brt system it's very difficult to do

00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,210
that when you don't know how millions of

00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,790
citizens are already getting around and

00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:07,470
where the demand is so there's been a

00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:09,030
number of projects that have sprung up

00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:11,460
in the past few years to get sense of

00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:17,100
well how does this operate where do

00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:18,990
these trips run so collecting apps so

00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,820
using apps collecting traces making

00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,830
paper-based maps and then a lot of these

00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,800
projects have gone towards making GTFS

00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:29,670
data feeds and that's been a little bit

00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,260
of a challenge because standard at

00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,480
standard that was created for Portland

00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,950
Oregon doesn't necessarily work in a

00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,410
place like Paraguay and place like

00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:43,920
Bangladesh the key issues that we've run

00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:46,050
into our frequency of trips or schedules

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,930
it may take you four hours to get across

00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:50,730
the city it might take you one hour the

00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,320
route might look like the route might

00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,030
look like one thing on a Monday it looks

00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,340
differently on a Tuesday based on local

00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,620
conditions and so we're working with

00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:01,200
GTFS but we're also having to make a lot

00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,760
of kind of fake fields and there's a

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,260
group of professionals that are in a

00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,390
working group kind of trying to deal

00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:09,060
with this and come up with a GTFS

00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:11,010
flexible standard so at least even if

00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,420
even if we're all kind of faking it a

00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:14,520
little bit we have an understanding of

00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,310
the areas that might not be a hundred

00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,050
percent perfect and so this is something

00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,340
that's still being worked out the World

00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:24,120
Bank is kind of taking the lead on that

00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:26,100
at the moment openstreetmap plays in

00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,780
because as soon as you're collecting

00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,550
traces of where the roots go you need

00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,830
something that you can overlay that onto

00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:35,310
and openstreetmap is generally the best

00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:36,810
available map for these areas so we're

00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:40,230
pulling data from that but we're also

00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:41,700
pushing it back in there especially at

00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:44,520
the Red Cross we don't really work with

00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,260
transit data but when we send people out

00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,450
all over West Africa we collect the

00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,190
traces in the background and then we're

00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:52,740
able to collect that amongst hundreds of

00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:54,360
volunteers put that into osm because as

00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,970
far as we're concerned like that is the

00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,260
road network so we're creating this in

00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:01,330
real

00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:04,160
time another thing with our son is that

00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:05,750
similar to how etfs doesn't necessarily

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,270
fit perfectly to a developing country

00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:10,040
context the way over some of those

00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:11,720
things is a little bit different as well

00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,000
so for example if we're thinking about

00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,610
how do we put in a station how would we

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,350
put in a stop that looks it differently

00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:20,090
because a stop is not necessarily a

00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,830
point-based feature a stop might be

00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:24,650
anywhere on this road or anywhere in

00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:29,990
this square so we have to think about

00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:31,820
well how do we work with this I think

00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:35,420
mapping Transport has also been really

00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,680
good for creating interest in osm lots

00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,630
of people may not be aware of

00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,880
openstreetmap but as soon as you have a

00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:42,470
use case that depends on having osm as

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,640
soon as you have an app that uses osm in

00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,150
the background there's an added

00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,710
incentive to keep that map up to date

00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:50,930
and it's also been really good for

00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,030
working with local governments and kind

00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,550
of advocating for ownership of your own

00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,340
data typically governments will get a

00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,140
road network file by hiring a consultant

00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,460
they go out there collect the data but

00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,140
they maintain ownership and they

00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,400
maintain that in a shapefile or even

00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,340
sometimes all the government has as a

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,780
PDF and then every new administration

00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,220
has to go through that process again

00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,760
because the data will get lost in

00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:16,520
transition so osm is kind of introducing

00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,960
a new awareness where people see that

00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,910
it's actually easy to create this on

00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,450
their own or easy to access it from an

00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:25,940
open-source place and that it's kind of

00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:28,430
democratizing data and new environments

00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,530
so that's my background so I'm kind of

00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:33,500
adding the informal context to this

00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:35,770
panel and that's all I have thank you

00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,770
very much

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,700
you should really learn to manage my

00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:46,900
expectations better because this was a

00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:49,060
very great presentation thank you so now

00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,100
i would like to invite all speakers to

00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:54,760
the to the panel and i would like to add

00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:57,820
one more like someone who doesn't really

00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,880
have a lot to say about public transit

00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:03,280
but he has a lot to say about route

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,330
planning that's that's true right you

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:09,430
huh yeah okay yes so I didn't insult you

00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:11,110
that's that's a really good not already

00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:14,200
went better than done done my previous

00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:16,780
talks I'm looking for the microphone

00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:20,650
technical people do did you have the

00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:24,820
book at Darius okay can we can give it

00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:26,890
to the do to you for a start so Johan

00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:30,100
can you introduce yourself please i'm

00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:33,940
johan i work at mapbox in berlin and i

00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:36,430
work on OEM the routing engine that we

00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,580
built it's open source but you can also

00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:43,930
use our API which is matte box

00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:45,880
directions ostrom is a is a routing

00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:49,030
engine that does shortest path routing

00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:52,480
on road networks it works with car bike

00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:54,910
and walk routing on osm all over the

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:59,050
world it does not work with public

00:45:54,910 --> 00:46:00,850
transit the reason why it doesn't work

00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:04,030
with public transit is because actually

00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:06,130
as we also a bit saw in in a to crest

00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:08,470
talk before there's like it's kind of a

00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,600
different problem of routing shortest

00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:13,420
paths on a road network and doing public

00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:16,600
transport routing the biggest difference

00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:20,260
is that with public transport you have a

00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,670
schedule so just because there's a train

00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:23,230
line doesn't mean it make sense to take

00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,930
that train line of the train only comes

00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:28,360
every 30 minutes whereas with a road

00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:30,220
network if you start now you will be

00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,470
able to make progress the whole time and

00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,560
you don't have to wait except if there's

00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:37,120
traffic jams but then you basically

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:41,230
model these by just saying you can go

00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:43,840
slower on the street ironic leaders like

00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:46,270
some overlap between the the transit

00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,240
routing and the routing with public

00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:52,780
transport and that is rich closings

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:55,050
tunnels and fairies which are all things

00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:59,130
Oh SRM cannot handle well at the moment

00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:01,840
it's basically a different style of

00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:04,090
ruling class where you have to say it

00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,250
makes sense to wait here like routing

00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:11,620
algorithms have trouble dealing with

00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:14,020
wait times I think we will never really

00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:21,030
implement public trans browning in orem

00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:23,530
because thank you very much Peter um

00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:26,500
because it's just different it's just if

00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:27,730
I gribbins what we what we would do if

00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,590
we would implement it and we actually

00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:30,880
start working prototypes but then

00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,790
realize how this is bigger than we

00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,650
thought of course is we would probably

00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:38,860
use the connection scan algorithm that

00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,510
ki te has some papers on so the console

00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:43,540
institute of technology has worked on

00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:45,490
this and published some papers that had

00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:50,230
new algorithm set up like fairly fast

00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:52,600
and that seemed well still to deal with

00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:56,380
the public the sorry the multi-modal

00:47:52,600 --> 00:48:00,120
approach so multimodal routing means you

00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:02,680
use different kinds of transport for

00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:06,400
coming from your start to your

00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,780
destination so for example the case that

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,130
we've seen and probably to audit this

00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,560
typical and fabric transferred as you

00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:13,090
walk to the station you take public

00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:17,080
transport and then you walk to your

00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:19,870
destination but this in the in the

00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,910
cities of the future we I think always

00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:24,460
imagine that there would be way more

00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:28,090
modes of transport so I would hop on my

00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:30,160
hover board that I rent and then like go

00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,810
through the park to the bus and then I

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,690
go with the bus somewhere and then I go

00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:36,940
in my hyper lube tube and then I go into

00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:39,970
a car sharing and this would be like the

00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,740
fastest route I could take this means

00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:43,300
crossing a lot of different services

00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:47,200
that have different capacities

00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:50,920
availability schedules prices all of

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,990
these things that I have trouble

00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:56,140
imagining all would work in one routing

00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:57,820
engine like you there's definitely other

00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:02,530
people think differently and I hope they

00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:04,770
are right what I how I see these systems

00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:07,440
would be built the multimodal cases

00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:09,350
is you have several routing engines for

00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,910
arch of these cases and have kind of a

00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:15,030
gathering approach where you query them

00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:17,670
with an algorithm that sits on top and

00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:20,850
you ask so what's all the public

00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:22,680
transportations around me how could I

00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:25,020
walk there and then what is the what is

00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,570
the public transportations that are near

00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:30,650
the destination I want to go and then

00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:32,820
try all the connections between these

00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,500
our ceramic and play a role in this

00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:37,170
because we have algorithms that help you

00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,640
with that so driving to the station is

00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:41,820
something that always remember can help

00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,310
with we also have we also provide

00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:47,450
distance tables so distance tables are

00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:51,540
basically routing between many different

00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:54,330
points so going from finding for example

00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:56,730
the nearest public transportation you

00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:59,250
could put in all the public

00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:01,320
transportations within like a 10 10

00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:03,300
kilometer radius for example and then

00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:06,180
ask how long does it take to get to each

00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,650
of them for example by foot then select

00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:11,910
the best one of that for your routing

00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:13,620
path all right very interesting always

00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:15,210
around that's something that that people

00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:19,070
in the audience they can install right

00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:23,740
away from from from our MDOT or gigas

00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:26,230
project- OEM org right

00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:28,900
and we also run a demo server it was

00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:30,310
funny when when you said that the one of

00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,350
the reasons why open trip planner is not

00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:34,869
used much is because there's no demo

00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:37,840
server yes open trip planner should have

00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:40,780
a demo server mapbox is running the demo

00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,970
server for project osram costs us a

00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:46,510
couple of hundred bucks per month to

00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:49,210
tomb just in running costs which is

00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:52,720
expensive the thing we get out of it as

00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:55,810
a company is that it we basically run

00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,550
master on it so every night we we

00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:59,980
install the latest version of RM on it

00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:03,310
and see if it still works so it's also

00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:05,350
our like integration test platform which

00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,180
is definitely great for us in seeing

00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:09,700
that the changes we do don't break

00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:11,110
anything that's so that's really

00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,910
interesting I have a lot of questions

00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:18,160
for you but because of time constraints

00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:20,680
I'll quickly shift to a touka 44 which

00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,140
actually three strim introduced a really

00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:26,320
nice question how would you deal with

00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:29,020
with stations list just like three strim

00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:30,640
dealt with how are you doing is right

00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:33,160
now for finland and how would you do it

00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:35,050
worldwide does that will that be one

00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:38,100
github repository with all stations

00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:41,320
worldwide or other you scale that up and

00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:44,109
maybe i missed why not have it all in

00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:48,490
OpenStreetMap maybe we have to work on

00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:50,320
the actual model for the what kind of

00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:53,200
tagging schemes we use and so on but I

00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:57,340
think we can improve them for different

00:51:53,200 --> 00:52:00,730
use cases at least yeah of course

00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:04,090
working only in 11 western country is

00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:08,380
easy in that we haven't so far seen any

00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:12,960
any issues in using the current tagging

00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:12,960
schemes in in Hell's again in Finland

00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:21,790
maybe you want to expand on a single bin

00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:27,819
street pub would be a great place to do

00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:30,049
it the thing is I think struggling with

00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:33,019
having a national database which is

00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:35,319
normalized maybe Finland has this kind

00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:39,910
of database United Kingdom hazard

00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:42,410
friends doesn't and I think this really

00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:44,479
there would be a lot of tears and crying

00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:48,259
mailing list about how you should

00:52:44,479 --> 00:52:50,779
represent it because one need is to have

00:52:48,259 --> 00:52:52,749
the identifier to query your API open

00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:55,309
trip planner which ID should i use and

00:52:52,749 --> 00:52:57,380
people locally would think otherwise

00:52:55,309 --> 00:53:00,079
because i want to represent how it looks

00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:03,319
like and not how the some random server

00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:06,499
somewhere things it is so having this

00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:08,630
distinction between how one information

00:53:06,499 --> 00:53:10,519
system sees icing which is maybe

00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,079
different from the theoretical data to

00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:13,670
the real-time data which might have

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,939
different ideas and different vision of

00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:20,930
what is a station with Informer transit

00:53:16,939 --> 00:53:23,299
is another huge thing some countries use

00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:25,400
blocks like intersection of streets

00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:28,910
somebody used just different streets

00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:32,979
some have areas and all these things is

00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:35,509
quite difficult to make a world-wide

00:53:32,979 --> 00:53:38,359
database difficult i think at one

00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:40,999
country level the culture is quite the

00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:43,839
same of what is the station I think this

00:53:40,999 --> 00:53:46,789
cultural thing would be difficult and

00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:48,469
the idea behind us is not mapping the

00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:50,749
word as we see it which is kind of the

00:53:48,469 --> 00:53:53,869
OpenStreetMap goal but how to interact

00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:56,509
with computer tools that need some

00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:58,929
information and the boundary is

00:53:56,509 --> 00:53:58,929
difficult

00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,660
now that you mentioned these different

00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:11,110
ID schemes reminds me of some one

00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:16,180
problem we have is that we do matching

00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:19,270
based on stop code so there's these four

00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:22,180
number codes for for every stop and

00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:24,970
these can then be also very including in

00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:27,160
our data API and they can be included in

00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:29,290
OpenStreetMap because it's visible at

00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,300
the stop but then actually we have these

00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:33,670
special cases where the stuff doesn't

00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:36,760
have a stop code so then the matching

00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:43,420
doesn't work here so it's been for

00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:45,910
reasons like the stop is only for not

00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:47,650
getting on the bus but only leaving

00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:50,800
passengers there so no one actually

00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:52,840
needs to find their way to the stop so

00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,730
it didn't have a code but now we have a

00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,550
reason to have a code so that we have

00:54:54,730 --> 00:55:00,640
these IDs that work too much different

00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:02,320
data sets so in the government we are

00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,490
then working to add add the necessary

00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:09,610
codes and yeah so this works in in

00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:13,270
Helsinki level then nationally I think

00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:17,020
at least European Union regulations say

00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:20,440
that each country is responsible for

00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:24,130
assigning these are consistent IDs to

00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:27,790
all kinds of geo-informatics elements

00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:30,130
including bus stops so at least in

00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:32,080
Finland there are all these IDs the

00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:33,820
problem is that the bus stops won't have

00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,970
the IDs so then we have to think about

00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:39,900
whether that is still appropriate to to

00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:42,610
include in in OpenStreetMap if it's

00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:45,640
available as open data basically the

00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:50,710
mappings of the coordinates of the stops

00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:53,860
and then the national identifier that's

00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:57,600
in fact also emily did you also see the

00:55:53,860 --> 00:56:02,080
similar i dint identification issues in

00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:05,800
the GIS world and where you have to link

00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:07,660
one identifier 22 to a certain or do the

00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,460
opposite if a real world object to a

00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,510
certain identifier how do you handle

00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,880
that in

00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:15,850
angie is in general because it's it's

00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:19,000
just one station identifier can you can

00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:20,740
also have a tree identifier and another

00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,630
thing identifier is how do you handle

00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:25,750
that in GIS systems it's a real problem

00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:28,000
I've made up a lot of root names or bus

00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:29,800
stop names or things like that one thing

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,930
i like about osm is it's easier to leave

00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,700
fields blank rather than making up fake

00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:36,520
numbers and things and kind of imposing

00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,750
my system of order on somebody else so

00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,530
that that's one thing that's great about

00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:43,530
osm I think one of the core problems is

00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:46,540
out there is that informal transit is

00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:48,610
much more demand responsive than what i

00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,020
would call formal transit and so in some

00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:51,460
ways it operates a lot more like what we

00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:55,660
call para transit in the United States

00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:57,490
which is something we're often persons

00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:59,650
with disabilities can kind of make a

00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,880
call and there's smaller transit buses

00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:03,730
that will go and kind of take them

00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,220
between points and so we have much more

00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:07,480
in common with that community because

00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:10,450
they're thinking about the same issues

00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:12,550
of you know a stop is a nebulous area or

00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:15,130
it may be a point it may be an area it

00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:20,800
may be all things at different times so

00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:22,360
it is a real problem ok so we can take

00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,810
questions from from the audience maybe

00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:30,150
yes this is a very professional

00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:30,150
microphone system for passing around

00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:41,830
thank you ok so thank you for the great

00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:43,150
talks everybody now i come from cairo

00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,680
and there we do a project is called

00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:46,750
transport for Cairo it's actually

00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,960
inspired by works digital matata so

00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:50,860
basically do the exact same thing and

00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,290
here I wanted to share some of the

00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:55,810
problems we face because we also share

00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:58,780
like the exact same methodology we get

00:57:55,810 --> 00:58:01,480
the data in the GIS handle it from there

00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:03,070
get the GTFS out there try to apply open

00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:07,650
trip planner on top of it and route on

00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:09,910
it one now one of the main design proper

00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:13,150
decisions that we took is to keep all of

00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:16,060
our transit information in GTFS separate

00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:18,370
from us and why because we still have to

00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:20,020
determine what is formal enough for what

00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,520
is scheduled enough to be able to be put

00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,190
in us and because that's a rigid

00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,860
structure

00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:27,140
whereas when we keep it in our own skin

00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:29,330
moves our own schema GTFS we can

00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,890
differentiate between both and I think

00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:33,830
that's important because if we just

00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:35,960
uploaded everything 2o sm we would sort

00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:38,810
of pollute the earth and master database

00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,490
was data well we're not really sure yet

00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:42,500
in a peer-reviewed way if it should be

00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:45,050
there or not that's the thing a

00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,640
technical problem we have in routing and

00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:48,620
here I'm actually looking to look into

00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:52,510
the routing engine that you mentioned

00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:55,550
Johann the OS and mapped base map data

00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:58,370
does not have a have a lot of sidewalks

00:58:55,550 --> 00:59:00,470
in Cairo because they do not exist but

00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:02,000
people work on the streets but that's a

00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,950
problem in routing because whenever you

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,720
use a routing engine you have to walk a

00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:08,780
kilometre to the station and even like

00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:10,640
if the station is here and the bus stops

00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:12,200
there if I make the bus stops there it

00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,510
stops a kilometer further away and you

00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:17,020
have to walk it all back so again I'm

00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:20,030
faced with an option either we need a

00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:22,190
modified routing engine or we need to

00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:23,900
change the data on OSN but then again

00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,760
can we outside works for you don't exist

00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:28,910
in reality how do we handle that that's

00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:31,340
a limitation that we face and you

00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:33,140
mentioned something very interesting the

00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,240
difference between a PT routing engine

00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:38,000
are driving routing engine schedules I

00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:40,100
would love to have around the guns and

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,960
without schedules that would work

00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:44,360
miracles in Cairo die will work better

00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,460
than what we do now which is creating

00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:49,910
estimated schedules there would be a

00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:52,220
great option one final comment for the

00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:55,400
unique identifier and GIS we have the

00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:57,520
same issue and we started using what

00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,660
three words as a unique identifier that

00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:03,700
creates a unique identifier for every

00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:06,800
stops and it works brilliantly try it a

01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:11,350
quick comment on what reverts a bus stop

01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,350
changes location that's a difficult part

01:00:13,339 --> 01:00:19,009
okay might be interesting is there

01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:22,339
someone from the panel wants to

01:00:19,009 --> 01:00:23,690
elaborate on this this comment is there

01:00:22,339 --> 01:00:26,059
someone from the audience who wants to

01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:30,430
or wait yeah you know I want to talk

01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:35,029
about localization of routing engines Oh

01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:38,589
SRM inherits the fact that it's maintain

01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:41,559
errs are sitting in Europe and the US

01:00:38,589 --> 01:00:45,559
definitely basically when we think about

01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:46,910
it's even worse when we think about car

01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:51,229
routing at the moment we think about the

01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:56,989
United States we think about right hand

01:00:51,229 --> 01:01:01,369
driving and localizing localizing

01:00:56,989 --> 01:01:03,710
routing is a huge issue that I mean

01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:06,529
first like the inheritance of having

01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:10,460
your cultural buyers not matching to

01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:12,140
Agriculture's totally a big problem but

01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,059
also the fact that there's different

01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,650
ways of like how routing works in all

01:01:14,059 --> 01:01:19,069
the world so left hand driving vs. right

01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:22,039
hand driving is a great example street

01:01:19,069 --> 01:01:24,499
name based instructions versus landmark

01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:28,160
based instructions great example we

01:01:24,499 --> 01:01:30,440
don't even have points of interest in

01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:33,920
orem like it's nothing we cannot even do

01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:37,130
this right now yeah I can only say it's

01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:39,440
like it's a big problem one of the cool

01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:40,940
things is that at least in orem you can

01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,829
change the profile if you set up your

01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:46,309
own instance you can change the profile

01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:48,589
to include to change it the way you want

01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:49,940
it so we can do left-hand driving but

01:01:48,589 --> 01:01:54,380
you have to set up your own instance for

01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:58,759
this we can you can decide that a a

01:01:54,380 --> 01:02:03,079
highway a motorway is walkable for

01:01:58,759 --> 01:02:05,779
pedestrians we decide that this is not

01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:07,309
true for the Western world but that can

01:02:05,779 --> 01:02:10,729
be changed so at least there's like some

01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:12,700
configuration already possible there to

01:02:10,729 --> 01:02:16,430
the question of like making making

01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:20,450
public transit routes routable without a

01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:22,260
schedule in orem yeah we could probably

01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:24,870
change the relations to

01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,790
ways and then it just works we never did

01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:31,170
this this sounds like a perfect heck day

01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:34,920
project to try out let's set up a doodle

01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:36,690
and let's make it work someone else

01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:40,830
wants to elaborate on this no okay we

01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:46,380
had another question I just wanted two

01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:49,050
rebounds on the three words and the

01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:51,380
funny thing is we had one provider but

01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:54,600
Brad with justice an aggregator of

01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:56,520
long-distance buses and because it's

01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:59,310
something quite new in Europe especially

01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:01,650
in France and I think in film into in

01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:03,180
Germany also they kind of start

01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:05,850
operating buses without infrastructure

01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:07,920
of our buses so they stop everyone the

01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:09,660
street and they kind of change the bus

01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,980
stop like every way because some

01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:13,470
neighbor complained that the bus

01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:16,830
shouldn't stop there and they used

01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:21,150
geocaching for that because had the

01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:23,370
interest that it can be Eric here I you

01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:25,380
have a here key so if you truncate it

01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:27,810
it's like a broader zone and the mo did

01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:30,390
you add the more precise it is and this

01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:33,420
allowed them to kind of mix top line

01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:36,570
stop areas and something broader which

01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:40,170
cannot be done with three words I think

01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:42,300
those are prototypes I have some reason

01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:46,100
to exist and it's very interesting thing

01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:46,100
to push forwards maybe it's a solution

01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:52,800
okay thank you one more one more quick

01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:56,790
thing to what three words data should be

01:03:52,800 --> 01:04:02,460
free service short cut costs money it's

01:03:56,790 --> 01:04:05,340
my opinion personal opinion comment and

01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:08,010
then maybe a crazy soon but I started

01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:10,080
with a a clarification I think one has

01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:12,540
always to keep in mind what it what is

01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:14,640
the question is the underlying question

01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:17,010
for me that the question I'm approaching

01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,720
this discussion with with the

01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:20,640
perspective I work for a National

01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,530
Statistical Office so for me the

01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:25,140
question is understanding aggregate

01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:27,510
mobility patterns and mobility trends

01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:29,610
rather than looking at specific routing

01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:31,589
for an individual so keeping in mind

01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:33,839
this perspective

01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:37,380
felt very interesting the discussion on

01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:41,910
open data and how open data can be used

01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:44,369
in OpenStreetMap and how openstreetmap

01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:47,849
can be used as a platform to integrate

01:04:44,369 --> 01:04:49,920
open open data and and again I come from

01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:52,499
a country where municipality are

01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:56,519
increasingly made making available open

01:04:52,499 --> 01:04:59,369
data under municipal portal or regional

01:04:56,519 --> 01:05:02,579
municipality or regional entity so there

01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:06,359
is an an incredible wealth of open data

01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:08,339
that is completely uncoordinated you

01:05:06,359 --> 01:05:10,319
know when i when i come from a

01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:13,200
perspective of a National Statistical

01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:16,819
Office and I'd look at this resource I

01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:21,299
mean you have an incredible diversity of

01:05:16,819 --> 01:05:24,269
coding system unit of measure etc etc so

01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:26,880
I was wondering if you know

01:05:24,269 --> 01:05:29,519
openstreetmap and the community of

01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,519
openstreetmap as ever consider making a

01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:35,180
coordinate effort in trying to make a

01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:37,380
better use of this this resource of

01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:39,839
municipal open data where they are

01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:41,819
available because I think this would be

01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:44,819
extremely valuable I understand that

01:05:41,819 --> 01:05:47,849
there is a debate there was a discussion

01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:50,009
early this morning on editing and

01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:51,509
imports and there are a lot of concern

01:05:50,009 --> 01:05:53,309
but I think this is an incredible

01:05:51,509 --> 01:05:54,719
resource that should be considered and

01:05:53,309 --> 01:05:56,460
there should be some discussion and

01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:58,469
coming from a National Statistical

01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:00,180
Office perspective I would be certainly

01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:02,279
very interested in being part of that

01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:04,890
discussion because will be helpful great

01:06:02,279 --> 01:06:08,279
value for us the final consideration is

01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:10,769
that is where in places where these data

01:06:08,279 --> 01:06:12,420
open data are not available maybe there

01:06:10,769 --> 01:06:14,579
are other resources that can also be

01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:19,349
integrated and thinking about big data

01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:24,269
and princess in my agency we're starting

01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:26,309
to look at also the potential of mobile

01:06:24,269 --> 01:06:29,009
phone data and the use of mobile phone

01:06:26,309 --> 01:06:30,900
data to track mobility of people and

01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:35,009
I've seen example for any point for

01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:38,249
instance from Mexico on the use of human

01:06:35,009 --> 01:06:40,529
social media tweets to track mobility of

01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:42,960
individual so I was thinking again can

01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:43,430
openstreetmap be used as a platform to

01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,130
try

01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:48,920
and integrate some of this data for some

01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:50,569
of these purposes again from an

01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:52,730
aggregate perspective that would not be

01:06:50,569 --> 01:06:54,559
you know the routing of the individual

01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:56,869
person but to generate an understanding

01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:58,130
of mobility patterns and if there is a

01:06:56,869 --> 01:06:59,839
potential I think there should be a

01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:06,020
discussion within the OpenStreetMap

01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:08,240
Canadian is thank you so I can address

01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:11,030
the first part about osm being used

01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,010
within governments or institutions so

01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:16,309
the American Red Cross we're a very

01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:20,300
large bureaucracy and we've managed to

01:07:16,309 --> 01:07:22,579
use osm within the organization working

01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:24,680
with other national governments I find

01:07:22,579 --> 01:07:27,589
that there's two questions about osm the

01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:29,420
first one is how can I trust this if I'm

01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:31,849
relying on this and I'm putting this out

01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:33,770
and kind of endorsing it in a way how do

01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:35,839
I know that someone's not going to go in

01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:37,220
and vandalize the data or what are the

01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,540
assurance is there so that's the first

01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:40,190
set of concerns that I've seen

01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:43,460
governments have and then the second set

01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:44,990
is Oh dbl and wanting to make sure that

01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:48,589
they understand the license and their

01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:52,040
obligations with that data in terms of

01:07:48,589 --> 01:07:53,869
encouraging use I'm not part of the osm

01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,549
foundation so I'm not sure what osm is

01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:57,740
kind of officially doing with

01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:59,690
governments but I know that large

01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:02,180
institutions are making a concerted

01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:04,309
effort to support one another so in

01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:06,740
Washington DC the Red Cross the World

01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:09,530
Bank and some departments at the US

01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:11,299
government are all kind of meeting on a

01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:14,569
monthly basis so that we can figure out

01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:16,370
how do we how do we advocate for one

01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:19,190
another because it's a lot easier for us

01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:21,319
as the Red Cross to say this is okay

01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:22,969
here's our answer to concerns but also

01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:24,830
the World Bank is using this but also

01:08:22,969 --> 01:08:27,620
the US government is using this but also

01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:29,630
all of these other organizations and

01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:31,730
that's something where we kind of try to

01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:34,940
band together and as a group we're a lot

01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:36,799
stronger so I'm not sure what comes from

01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:38,660
osm foundation but at least the large

01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:40,130
institutions are kind of very willing to

01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,900
kind of put out their use cases and

01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:43,969
their experiences to try to help

01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:49,460
governments and municipalities to become

01:08:43,969 --> 01:08:51,469
more able to use this okay so I'm really

01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:54,199
sorry but I will have to break there

01:08:51,469 --> 01:08:56,679
because if that person there is pointing

01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:58,630
to me is that you should stop right now

01:08:56,679 --> 01:09:00,009
so first of all I would like to thank

01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:02,049
everyone for being here there was a

01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:05,889
really a really interesting session

01:09:02,049 --> 01:09:08,799
thank you three strim you hon Emily and

01:09:05,889 --> 01:09:10,509
took her for for for being last minute

01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:14,019
panelists because I've been a bit

01:09:10,509 --> 01:09:16,119
chaotic and my invitations but thank you

01:09:14,019 --> 01:09:18,329
to everyone and now up for coffee that's

01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:18,329
