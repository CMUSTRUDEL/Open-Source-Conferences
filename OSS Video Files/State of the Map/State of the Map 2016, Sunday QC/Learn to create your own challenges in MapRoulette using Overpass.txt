Publication date: 2016-10-21
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Sunday QC
Description: 
	Martijn van Exel at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/learn-to-create-your-own-challenges-in-new-maproulette/

A new Maproulette has replaced the old, and creating challenges is now easier than ever. In this workshop, we will take you behind the scenes and introduce you the art of crafting MapRoulette challenges. You will learn how to use Overpass queries to create challenges in seconds, and we will lift the veil on using the MapRoulette API and administration interface that is available to challenge administrators. You will come out of this session ready to create your own challenges to share with your local community or mappers all over the world!

welcome everyone thanks for joining it

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,449
was who is used it was used meprolight

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:22,650
before who has used meprolight before

00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:24,570
i'll try and speak a little louder so

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,930
I'm gonna do a walk-through first to

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,260
show you what my pearl it is and then

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,380
we're going to talk about how you can

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,090
help people help make openstreetmap

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,329
better through my palate through a

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,460
processes that we call creating

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,510
challenges and I'll explain what all

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,270
that is in a little bit you can follow

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,010
along I have to I had to create a PDF

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,680
version of this presentation but the

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,399
whole thing is online it's pretty much

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,250
the same thing anyway but there's a URL

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,690
bit ly / metro map roulette dash

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:06,560
workshop sotm and that's all that's also

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:11,430
where these slides will remain available

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:17,549
after the fact into eternity or whenever

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:19,530
Google goes out of business today's

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,259
topics so first an interface walkthrough

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,750
so what is map or let the basics of of

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,909
solving problems openstreetmap problems

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,770
through Maryland and and also the

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,200
administration interface so when you

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,140
login how you can administer your own

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,479
stuff that you create in my palate then

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,820
a few words about what makes a good map

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,820
Roulette challenge and again all those

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,979
words will be explained shortly the

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,070
challenge wizard that we have to create

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:54,090
challenges and then the f meprolight API

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:57,540
that's also another way for programmers

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,219
to create challenges so those are the

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,590
things and I hope to have quite a bit of

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,930
time left I'm not planning to talk for

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,060
75 minutes for sure more like 30

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,530
probably and then we'll have time for

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,660
questions and discussion and

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,340
kind of take bring your own ideas for

00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:17,590
challenges I hope that this workshop

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:19,300
will give you a few ideas so when you go

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:24,490
to meprolight org this is what you'll

00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:27,190
see you see basically a big map that

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,620
shows locations and the locations

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:32,020
represent the rectory represents sort of

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,250
the centers of where the challenge is re

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,530
so you can see that there's a challenge

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:39,360
in Argentina there's one challenge that

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:43,720
looks like it looks like it's it's in in

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,430
in California a few and then in central

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,260
the scent central part of the u.s. so

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,260
there's you can drag around and see you

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,820
see more challenges there's a search box

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,660
that you can use if you if you know what

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:59,170
you're looking for in the challenge and

00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:02,170
and then there's a few kind of featured

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,580
items and latest challenges and not of

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,200
course you can sign in there at the top

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,120
signing in goes through through

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,650
openstreetmap so you just get redirected

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,690
through openstreetmap and then you log

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,780
in there and you get redirected back and

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,459
then you're that will create your map

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,400
roulette account or sign you into it if

00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:25,690
you're if you're not already if you

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:26,739
already have one so if you zoom in a

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,019
little bit and you click on an

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,760
individual challenge icon it will you

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:33,280
get a few you get a little bit of detail

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,870
what what a challenge is and it

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,670
challenge is basically a group of tasks

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,709
and tasks are little things that you can

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,530
do to improve openstreetmap so they're

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,880
grouped into challenges and this this

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,190
particular challenge is about pools

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,459
someone detected using computer vision

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,140
no I think using public records

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,329
addresses that should have that have

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,980
pools so a lot of people in the Los

00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:00,760
Angeles area apparently have pools in

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,799
their homes and their those are those

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,079
are not yet an osm so and then that's it

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,380
says a little bit about little little

00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,820
circle shows how many of those tasks

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,130
have already been resolved that's the

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,530
green part so this one has most of it is

00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,590
still to be done the difficulty which is

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,409
the self assigned by the author of this

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,360
challenge how hard it is easy normal or

00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:24,129
hard and you can

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,740
view the entire challenges it would get

00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:28,509
a map of all of its tasks or you can

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,919
start it which means a thick they will

00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,930
take you to a random challenge that's

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,479
the roulette part of my problem it's

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,539
very random so you if you if you enter a

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,789
challenge you get thrown into it and

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:42,280
there's a you will get a random task so

00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:46,270
it could be anywhere within the scope of

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,430
the challenge that makes it fun I think

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,639
to solve them because you'd never really

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:54,150
know what you're getting and that's what

00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,379
that's what worked very well in the past

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,479
so when you view the challenge you get

00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,430
you get like a distribution clustered of

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,710
all the where all the tasks are in this

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:06,580
in this particular case it's just one

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:11,289
one single area in the Los Angeles metro

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,969
and then this represents a single task

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:14,879
this is of a different challenge i

00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:17,620
skipped skipped it a little bit here

00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,779
this is a challenge that has rivers that

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,930
float in the wrong direction so someone

00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:26,080
went and created took an elevation model

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,419
and then took all the all the streams

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,550
and rivers in lsm and the direction of

00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:32,919
the river is supposed to be the same as

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:37,089
the direction in which the river flows

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:38,979
so whenever the osim object that

00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:41,289
represents the river flows in this

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,150
direction but the elevation model shows

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:44,949
that that's actually uphill and that

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,370
would get flagged and people would be

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:52,449
asked to to reverse that so this is one

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:54,009
individual task this basically shows you

00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,169
the difference between log being logged

00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,939
in and not being logged in the

00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,439
difference is that you can certain the

00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:01,240
right in the right bottom you can edit

00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,650
now and you can mark something as a

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,439
false positive you can't do any of those

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,629
things if you're not logged in you also

00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,659
have a few more items on the left as you

00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:12,400
can see as I scroll back and forth I'll

00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:15,069
go into those in a little bit and use of

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,029
course you see or your little your o

00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:19,990
same username there at the top as well

00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:21,610
otherwise I mean you can do a lot of

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,979
things like viewing everything when

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,830
you're not logged in as well you have a

00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:31,479
low profile page where's my clicker

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:35,350
others will profile page where you can

00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,180
see some basics about your about your

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,830
your identity on my palate which is

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,320
basically a lot of the same stuff that's

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:44,800
already enough bits what's there is just

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,240
what's in osm what we get from osm you

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,120
get an API key which will become

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,670
important later and then there's a few

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,810
things that you can set some defaults

00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,970
you can set there is a misspelled

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,120
version of Jaws ohm which actually

00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,580
should be Justin but says just just some

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,160
which is I think fixed in the meantime I

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,140
apologize you can set a default base

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,000
maps for your challenge challenges can

00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,830
also set their own default base maps you

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,290
can for those who don't do that you can

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,980
set your own default base map that you

00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:17,770
see when you navigate around map rollin

00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:20,710
you can also set like a custom tile URL

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,230
as a custom base map if you really want

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:27,310
that and some people did so I did so we

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:29,290
did that your default default locale

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,470
which basically just determines the

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,000
language for now and there's a few stubs

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,530
of translations if you want to help out

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
translating into more languages please

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:42,970
do and then there's some gratuitous team

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,680
selection that you can engage when so

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,020
you can I mean that's basically this

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:52,320
determines the color of the of the top

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:56,590
bar there's metrics we all have metrics

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,840
this is basically tells you how how much

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:03,130
progress is being made on map roulette

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:05,080
in various ways how many things have

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,630
been fixed over time and you can change

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,010
the time scale of that as well so this

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,840
is all available also when you're not

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,000
logged in it's available on a global

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,200
scale so through all challenges

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,570
currently there are about 100 in

00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,830
Maryland but you can also see this for

00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,940
individual challenges including of

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,050
course the ones that you make yourself

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,050
which is what we're here for

00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:29,140
administration interface so this is

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,510
where the challenge wizard lives it's

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,130
it's you can add you can you can get

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,690
there through clicking projects on your

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,280
left this is what you see when you will

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,380
when you're logged in everybody every

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,580
user gets one project a project is

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,800
basically a space where all your

00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,570
challenges live so every user has one

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,520
and you can create as many challenges

00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,360
underneath your in your within your

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,160
project as you want so for default

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,570
you'll just see one project in the list

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,220
because you only get one if you want

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,880
more you can ask me and I'll create more

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,470
but it's it any any any challenge as

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,970
many challenges as you want can live

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:06,040
under one project so that's the that's

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,850
the basic hierarchy right form applet

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,920
stuff you have your project you get one

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,269
when you first log in you can create as

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,690
many challenges as you like and any

00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:19,990
challenge can can get as many tasks as

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,029
you like it's it's probably not smart to

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,800
have too many tasks in one single

00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:27,130
challenges because it becomes very hard

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,810
to kind of see the see the end of it if

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,100
you have hundred thousand tasks in your

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,100
challenge you probably want to split it

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,110
up a little bit because yeah I think

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,029
it's just not fun if you have a hundred

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,440
thousand things that you want to that

00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:41,140
you need to fix it kind of seems

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:47,649
insurmountable and it becomes very hard

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:50,320
to get users to help you out these are

00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,180
basically already covered every user get

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,970
one gets one project you can create any

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,470
number of challenges and you can have

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:03,310
any number of tasks within those

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:05,350
challenges so by default projects and

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,360
challenges have visibility visibility is

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,829
by default always false so you can

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,870
create something and it won't be visible

00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:14,230
to on the on the map that shows all the

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,660
challenges but rather you can set that

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,130
later so your project can be visible or

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,860
invisible but also your challenges can

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:23,079
be visible or invisible you can set that

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,199
through clicking on the little drop down

00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:30,040
menu on the right and and then there

00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:31,810
there will be an edit an edit item which

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,490
will give you some which will give you

00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,860
access to the project settings where you

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,720
can set the name description that's not

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,720
being used right now and the visibility

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,930
so how about creating a challenge

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,089
there's two ways and that I'm going to

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:52,390
talk about next that's kind of the bulk

00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:55,510
of the of the workshop one is through

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,339
the through the map roulette website

00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,079
which is called which I call for lack of

00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,870
a better name the wizard and then

00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:03,220
there's the API both of these things

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,290
will get some attention

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:09,459
who have you have created map roulette

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:11,319
challenges in the past already 0 okay

00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:15,040
well that's great you'll learn how to do

00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:16,569
it now well I mean there's there's

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,879
already quite a few people who have done

00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:21,519
it so I was hoping I was wondering if

00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,079
there if any of them had been had been

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,060
it would be it would be here to see how

00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,740
because this is this map roulette

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,000
version I've completely failed to

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,680
mention that is new and the old version

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,779
had a different API and did not have a

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,129
wizard at all so that I think that's the

00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:39,040
wizard is one of the main things that

00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:40,810
I'm very very happy with in the new map

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,850
roulette there's still ton of work to be

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,250
done but this is something that allows

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,589
basically anyone so you used to used to

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:53,680
have to use the API for you to make a

00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:55,120
challenge and that puts up a barrier to

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,430
a whole lot of people because not

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,550
everybody knows how to work with an API

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:03,279
most people don't but a lot of people

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,759
have ideas on how to query openstreetmap

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,500
in a way that it that it that its

00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,329
surfaces little tiny little errors that

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,879
we want fixed but they don't necessarily

00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,829
know how to put that into a form that

00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,079
would make it into a metrology and so

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:18,490
that's where this wizard comes in and

00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,490
that's what we're going to spend the

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,709
next time on the API is actually going

00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:27,569
to be last so I'm going to skip this for

00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:30,990
now and what makes a great challenge

00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:35,139
challenges are easy to come up with so

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:38,399
I'll give one example that I bet i've

00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:42,430
used in the past a lot so how about

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,319
you'd make a query for all the

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:50,379
restaurants in a city that don't have

00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:51,910
opening hours like restaurants points in

00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:53,860
awesome are much more useful if they

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,990
have opening hours or maybe a website

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,759
tag it's very easy to query for those

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,699
that don't and then you can put them in

00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,500
a map Roulette challenge and make and

00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,970
have people you have people at that at

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,069
the cydia that information by just

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,199
looking it up on the internet through

00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:10,660
public information that the business

00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:13,870
itself provides there's tons of other

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,880
exam this is just a simple example does

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,660
anyone did anyone come here with an idea

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,850
of the channel

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,110
that they wanted to make already is

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:29,769
there any is there anyone who has

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:32,290
already had plans take a city and

00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,029
completely public transport public

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,279
transport a conversion to taget yeah

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,170
that would probably be possible as long

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,579
as you can query it as long as you can

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,670
query for the information that's not

00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:45,610
right or missing you can put it in my

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,920
pearl it and make it make it into a

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,269
challenge but I wanted to I wanted to

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,870
share a few words about like what I

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:54,519
think would make makes good challenges

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,199
or great challenges rather than kind of

00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,870
ones that probably won't get a lot of

00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:01,509
attention in my emphasis based on my

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,279
experience so here's a few things good

00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:05,829
instructions are extremely important and

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,540
every task can get its own instruction I

00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:10,329
usually have the same instruction for

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,399
every single task you can use markdown

00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:14,800
which is a simple language similar to

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,540
HTML but even simpler that you can use

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,500
to kind of create links and make things

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,850
bold make things you make things make

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,649
make a really clear instruction you can

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,660
even add little images if you need to

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,610
clarify things and those will those will

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,100
appear everytime you every time a user

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,870
gets is a task is displayed to a user

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,680
that instruction gets displayed with it

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:39,300
so those are key to having good having a

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,300
good challenges having good instructions

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,430
it needs to be simple in the sense that

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,839
it targets individual Oh same objects

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,670
not whole areas so that we have a

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,519
tasking manager for that right to fix

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,290
entire areas of stuff you need to be

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,860
very specific i want this object fixed

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,449
this way this relation this is node the

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,269
question also needs to be specific not

00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:04,389
like can you improve this way no we have

00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:06,339
to be very specific can you add tag XYZ

00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:07,990
to this way or can you make sure that

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,370
the direction is right or can you do it

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,500
can you so you have to ask a very

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:13,600
specific question that's the map

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,009
roulette is really about a quick flow of

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,199
like I want to fix this and want to fix

00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:19,180
this fix this and fix this and do like

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,759
maybe five tasks in a minute rather than

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,230
one task in five minutes although you

00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,240
can you can you can have more elaborate

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,709
tasks but you just have to be make sure

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,350
that you ask a specific question that

00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:30,880
users don't get distracted too much I

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,040
mean we all know how to track

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,180
mapping can be once you start an area go

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,630
fix this hole fix this I know a thousand

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,580
times so all of that adds up to it

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,120
becoming addictive and fun so people

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:48,990
need to really get into the flow map

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,870
roulette is really an armchair tool and

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,460
as much as as much as as much discussion

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,840
as there is has been about armchair

00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:00,250
mapping throughout the history of

00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,140
Awesome it this is an armchair tool so

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,960
you don't you don't want you to have to

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,130
need local knowledge unless you have a

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:10,630
map Roulette challenge that is really

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:12,100
designed to to to be done by people that

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:17,470
live in your neighborhood or or in your

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:20,110
town or in your village examples of that

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,670
are like to have people verify stuff

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,500
against aerial imagery like is there a

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:27,160
cemetery here can you see it on aerial

00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,860
imagery or not so this is for example in

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:34,090
the u.s. we haven't we've had a cemetery

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,650
import that was or like a import of

00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,690
various types of features but cemeteries

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,340
among them some of them ever some of the

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,900
data is not being verified for 50 years

00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,670
so a lot of those cemeteries are

00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,650
probably gone even though cemeteries

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:49,120
have a pretty good life span usually for

00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:52,150
by their nature another example might be

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,350
that upstream river you also technically

00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,670
don't need local knowledge for that

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,140
because you would be able to see from

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,720
the aerial imagery whether whether

00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,220
whether it flows up or down hill in most

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,290
cases I mean there's always going to be

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:07,540
exceptions loops wrote loops that you

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,040
can never escape would might be another

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,430
example that's easy to verify even

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,319
without aerial imagery the links are

00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,920
actually in the presentation those are

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,199
challenges that exist today and not huge

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,880
as I said like if you have that many

00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:27,030
thousands of task is probably is better

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:30,760
better to split them up a little bit um

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:34,300
see ya let's get let's get into an

00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,010
example and here we get into the any

00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,410
questions so far about map roulette what

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:44,340
it is what it does what it doesn't do

00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:44,340
can I just continue okay yeah

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,260
right question is

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,100
right so the question is of is it is it

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,620
more geared towards fixing or adding

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,510
stuff I think it can be used for adding

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,919
but I think if you if you couldn't ask

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:14,169
if you're going to be asking people to

00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:15,610
add features just based on like the I

00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:17,590
mean the previous rule applies that if

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,480
there if there if a question is very

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,940
specific so can you add this building or

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,520
can you add this based on some external

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,530
source or something I think that's that

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,740
would be fine if you if you're going to

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:31,690
be asking people to add like something

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,549
more abstract like can you add all the

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,780
buildings in this area then I think

00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:37,929
tasking manager is probably a better

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,340
tool so it's more of a fixing tool it

00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:41,500
can be used for adding as well but you

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,980
have to be very specific information for

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,480
example some external data source it

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,130
could map roulette could take the place

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,750
of a fully automatic import and make it

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,559
into a manual import if you have some

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,760
external data that you want verified

00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,309
yeah so the example that I was going to

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:04,690
do does it answer your question ma'am

00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:08,350
okay an example that I'd like to explore

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:10,450
is again a fairly simple one the opening

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,710
hours this this time applied to machine

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:17,049
museums and zoos rather than rather than

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,580
restaurants so again I want to keep it

00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:20,140
simple to focus on the process rather

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,669
than the rather than the challenge so

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,460
this is an overpass query that would

00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:28,150
would that would get those that will get

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:33,040
those things out of lsm for you for for

00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:36,070
the state of Utah where I live if you so

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,860
overpasses a ism so the mapper blood

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,929
wizard consumes overpass queries so you

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,070
can use that to make your challenge if

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,290
you know a little bit of overpass

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,000
overpasses is a super useful thing to

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,760
learn if you want to work with awesome

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,190
data so if you don't know it yet go to

00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,570
overpass turbo which is probably the

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,179
easy way to easiest way to get started

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:58,120
and check out some of the examples and

00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:59,799
think come up with a few questions of

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,760
stuff that you'd like to get out of

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,710
awesome so in this case I don't want to

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,909
get into the overpass query itself I'm

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,220
happy to do that with you if you're

00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:10,390
interested later but this this overpass

00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,610
query gets

00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:16,270
all the zoos and museums that don't have

00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:22,180
overpass in the area of the state of

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:24,490
Utah and if you load that into overpass

00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,410
turbo this is what you get and I'm just

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,210
checking if there's not a huge number of

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,800
features that are there that are there I

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,100
come that come out of that in this case

00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,140
it's only 48 so that's very reasonable

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,840
and this query took only 10 seconds to

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:41,620
run i think so that's fairly easy fairly

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,630
quickly quickly done what you do next is

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,730
you go to the project screen again and

00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,830
in that in that dropped same drop-down

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,670
menu you can you can start a new

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:53,740
challenge and then force this four steps

00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,110
basically the general information step

00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,230
where the important instruction part it

00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:01,630
comes into play then the the the weather

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,660
where the actual data comes in step 2

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:07,510
the geography AMA trees for the

00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,490
challenge then the third step would be

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,080
the the third and fourth step are

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,780
optional I'll go I'm going to go into

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,270
those a little bit later very briefly so

00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,460
the first step is the is the is the

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,690
challenge metadata if you will so that's

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,280
where yeah that's where you give the

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,140
challenge a name you give it a

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,000
description description is not very well

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,780
not very widely used within my privilege

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,040
yet this is and then and then is the

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,060
most important part really there is

00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:36,160
instruction so the name should be short

00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:39,660
it should be described but you want

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,620
people to do in just a few words and

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,060
this is how the challenge gets

00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:47,200
identified when you click on it on the

00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,850
map and then the most the most important

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,460
other required part is the instruction

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,830
so here's what I did for this challenge

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,360
this store is this tourism instruction

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,730
does not have opening hours in awesome

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,380
it would help visitors to this place if

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,180
you would add these look up their

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,250
website and find the opening hours there

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,410
and then add them to the node in osm if

00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,840
you use jawsome we recommend using the

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,880
opening hours editor editor opening

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,230
hours editor plugin and then i added

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,790
some more that you can't see here but

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,710
you see that it's very it's a very

00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,940
specific instruction that it really

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,330
tells users what they should be doing

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,820
and I think that helps a lot with users

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:24,039
kind of the map of let mappers being

00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,759
able to understand

00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:30,070
what they need to do added some tags as

00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,600
well but it helps people find them to

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:35,019
the search the search function of my

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,059
pearl in the difficulty is also set

00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:39,429
there I mean you can set that yourself

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:40,720
to it by default is normal if you have

00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:44,830
something that's particularly easy to

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,419
fix and you can set it too easy and then

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,509
here if you click Next and you have then

00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:51,309
the that's where that's where the

00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:54,519
overpass query comes in there's actually

00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:56,619
three ways to to add the to add the map

00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:58,450
roulette tasks this is where the tasks

00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:59,799
get added so the one one of them is the

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,269
overpass query that said where you

00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:04,539
basically just copy it from overpass

00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:08,320
turbo and you put a paste it in the

00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:11,409
overpass API field the other two methods

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,820
are too just to upload geo JSON to my

00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:15,639
privilege which is another way that a

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,919
lot of people like and you can also pull

00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:23,769
in point to a URL where some do Jason

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:26,440
lives on the Internet one thing that's

00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:28,210
important is that the out statement so

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,039
this is a particular statement where the

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:34,599
overpass results gets output to the user

00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:37,179
contains that contains these contains

00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:39,940
these specific parameters this is

00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:41,049
explained in the wizard as well it's

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,820
just something that you need to adhere

00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:44,799
to when you when you make a chat when

00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:50,229
you create when you create the overpass

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:52,840
query so briefly the two optional steps

00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:54,970
you can prioritize tasks that you want

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,129
to fixed first based on specific osm

00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:01,149
tags so there's a little bit of a like a

00:23:57,129 --> 00:24:02,889
prioritization rule interface there it's

00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:04,210
not being used much yet but it's it

00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:07,359
could be useful if you for example you

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,940
have you have you have roads that are

00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,349
like primary secondary tertiary and want

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,479
the primary is fixed first and then the

00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:15,639
secondaries and then the tertiaries then

00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:20,440
that might be useful to prioritize them

00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:22,809
that way some extras that you can set

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,519
the minimum maximum zoom zoom levels the

00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:27,369
default zoom level that is shown to the

00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:29,619
user the base map that the user gets

00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:31,479
shown you can also add custom base maps

00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:33,849
if you have a title URL that you want to

00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:35,409
use instead of the default so if you

00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:36,940
have specific aerial imagery for a

00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:37,760
region or something and you can add that

00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,720
there

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,090
and then basically you can you click the

00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,910
the complete button and then it will

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:49,610
start you can see do I have laser here

00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:52,310
well I guess you can see that it's it

00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,930
says building which basically means that

00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,820
it's going to overpass it's fetching all

00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,770
the things and then it will populate

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,290
meprolight in the back in the background

00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:03,410
with the tasks and then finally if it's

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:05,360
done it will will say here in the in the

00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,890
bottom if you reloaded it will say that

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,050
there's 48 tasks there which is how many

00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:16,010
tasks were we're in them in the the

00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:17,840
overpass query result so once it's done

00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,910
you can see that there's in fact 48 now

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,470
I waited a little bit and then you can

00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,450
you can go you can go and view that

00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,650
challenge and you'll see basically the

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,630
same thing as you saw in overpasses

00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:30,920
displayed a little differently there's a

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:35,660
48 tasks the same ones that we saw in in

00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:38,960
over an overpass turbo and here's a

00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,730
here's an example so that's when you

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,100
when you when you zoom in on two into

00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,950
one give one one single task and and

00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,080
view it you see here a museum that

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,700
doesn't have opening hours you can see

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,930
it on the base map but you can you

00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,730
cannot see of course that it doesn't

00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:55,760
have opening hours because the base map

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,470
does not display that one little bug

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,260
that you can see here is that the link

00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,880
that I post it to the awesome opening

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,060
hours editor plugin shows up in white

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,290
whereas the box itself is also white

00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:11,240
that's a really annoying little bug that

00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:13,010
I think I've fixed by now so and then

00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,850
you basically them you see the map the

00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:18,860
URL there this is basically the URL the

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,050
parts of the URL is basically epilator

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,850
org and then map and then 524 is your

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:24,560
challenge ID and then the last part is

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:27,110
just a task ID so if you want to share

00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,970
this by at this point you can you can

00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,430
you can share this URL with your with

00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:35,420
anyone you want to help with solving

00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:38,150
this challenge and if you share the link

00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,680
it will be it will be accessible even if

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,960
even if this challenge is not set to

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,430
visible the only difference that setting

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,740
at the visible make is that it will

00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,510
appear in the map roulette interface

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,910
when people search for challenges or

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,790
discover them by using the map on the

00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:55,990
main page

00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,990
so your challenge is basically now done

00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:00,170
other links that you that you then have

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:03,470
for your challenge using the same

00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:05,540
challenge ID the metrics is available

00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:08,090
through through that you I dash metrics

00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:11,510
URL and then you can see that overview

00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:15,440
Maps through the view URL so these URLs

00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:19,850
are static and always available for your

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,110
for your particular challenge ID so how

00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:34,850
does how's that looking do you think you

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:38,450
can work with this questions yeah right

00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:40,130
the question was do it if we want a few

00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,510
if we don't want too many tasks is this

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,090
is this one example where you would want

00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,310
to split it into for example challenges

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,020
for different states yeah I think that

00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,570
would be great idea also because you can

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,800
then engage more local users because if

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,660
challenge is always more attractive for

00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,340
people who are kind of more a little bit

00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,650
more familiar with the area so for

00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,150
example in my in my salt lake city of a

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,740
street map meet up I can point people to

00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,630
this challenge and they would

00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,160
immediately recognize this problem

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,800
because they will know many of these

00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,350
museums and zoos and that always helps

00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,150
with engagement and always and that is

00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,490
on top of the reason that I mentioned

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,220
before that challenges with thousands of

00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:17,960
tasks are just seen kind of to too

00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,550
overwhelming to people so yeah that I

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,840
think that's a that's a great idea in

00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,880
this case to spread it out

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,880
geographically and through the overpass

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,230
API that's fairly simple to do and

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,180
actually if you have a challenge you can

00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,580
if you have a challenging you created at

00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,350
once you can clone it also and make it

00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,990
make it available as a new challenge

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,670
just change the parameters a little bit

00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:42,230
so you don't have to type in everything

00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:44,510
again any other questions so far because

00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:48,760
the next next up is the API so I'm going

00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:48,760
to switch a little bit yeah

00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:02,070
right the question is whether whether

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,900
you should wear you should / you whether

00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:07,790
you should promote it or if there is

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,790
there some way to promote it for you

00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:18,420
what the part I understand oh yeah

00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,770
meprolight so definitely it definitely

00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,570
helps if you the question is like

00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,030
whether whether there's already enough

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,590
of a crowd using it to to that you don't

00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:28,050
have to do anything at this point the

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:30,630
answer is no you definitely should tell

00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:32,130
people about your challenges I have a

00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:35,010
lot of ideas for the future on how to

00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:39,330
better promote new challenges stuff like

00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:41,130
having like a weekly a weekly email for

00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,940
that contains all the interesting new

00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:46,860
challenges through the API you could do

00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,200
stuff like extracting the most popular

00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,220
challenges and make a list of that so

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,170
there's a lot of stuff that could be

00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,690
done but right now meprolight is still

00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:57,650
kind of it's even though there is about

00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:00,600
100 challenge in there it the

00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,220
discoverability is not great enough that

00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,260
you would that you would get away with

00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,690
just posting it and expecting people to

00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,630
just start solving problems so

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:13,500
definitely promoted it helps the general

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:16,710
kind of name recognition of map roulette

00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,690
in itself and get more users to kind of

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,250
discover new things so yeah it's a good

00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,020
question i think that's definitely going

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,040
to be important that everyone helps out

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,040
with that did you

00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:48,510
the question is if you have if you have

00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,880
P if you if you could if you could link

00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:53,460
people to to image to specific images

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,480
then you you might be able to you might

00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,220
be able to to kind of yeah you're

00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,070
basically saying that through images you

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:05,150
can you can have like kind of fake local

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,150
knowledge because he's

00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:29,000
yeah so um basically integration with

00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:31,299
external external images like opus

00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,840
review whether that would be possible

00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:37,159
technically yes you would have to you

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,600
would have to gift you would have to

00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,850
then probably do it through the ape the

00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,909
wizard is not powerful enough to kind of

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:45,799
create that sort of integration but if

00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:48,679
you have a set of images that you know

00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:50,659
are that that that you know the

00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,460
locations for then you would through

00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,559
that be able to connect create an API

00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,659
and you would be able to create an image

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,880
link for the instruction that has the

00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:01,130
image even in the instruction so you can

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,019
you can have it right there and have

00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,510
people look at the look at the image

00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:06,830
directly in map or let even so it's

00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,880
definitely possible it just takes a

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,559
little bit more working you have to go

00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,470
beyond what's available for the through

00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:14,480
the through the to the wizard yeah I

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,919
would have to work through the API but

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,720
that's a thing that's a great bridge to

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:24,289
go through that let me do it quite a

00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:25,700
time check real quick okay good so this

00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:28,490
is more for this is the part that's more

00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:32,720
for programmers for pick people who want

00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:34,399
to develop links between their

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,809
application or their data and map

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,149
roulette so they want the people who

00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:40,909
want to create tasks problem

00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:43,429
programmatically or consume data from

00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:45,490
map roulette to use it in some way that

00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:47,570
I don't know yet what that would be

00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:50,090
there's automatically generated

00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:53,750
documentation at port 8000 of nepalese

00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:57,500
org that you can that you can you see

00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:59,450
there there's no real nice documentation

00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,039
yet so this workshop for now the slides

00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:05,450
for this workshop will have to function

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,799
as the nice documentation I maybe there

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:10,039
will be something nicer in the future

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,850
but just yeah these slides should give

00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:17,380
you a good pointer to into kind of the

00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:19,700
main flow that you might want to use

00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,100
first thing you need to find out is your

00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,500
API key I pointed out that before you

00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,809
can just copy that from there if it's

00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,630
somehow compromised you can rebuild your

00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:31,669
API key as well with one click if you if

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:34,570
you somehow posted it on get up by

00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:34,570
example or whatever

00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,520
then the next thing you need to figure

00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,840
out is what is your project ID because

00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,140
everything needs to be under your

00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,640
project so and a lot of API calls

00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:48,040
reference the project that that a

00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,670
challenge lives under so that's in this

00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:54,100
case that's positive number nine first

00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:55,870
thing you do is create the challenge and

00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,840
I'm going to kind of walk through this

00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:00,700
without without going over every single

00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:07,420
detail but i'll point out a few of the

00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:08,770
salient parts here the end point is in

00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,030
these in this set of slides the end

00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:15,360
point is always at the top so in this

00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:20,409
case it's a / AP I / v 2 / challenge and

00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:24,340
the HTTP headers are at the top and then

00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:26,530
the post content is at the bottom so in

00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:28,870
this industry what what's important to

00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:31,270
note here is that the API key needs to

00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:33,820
be in this specific header header format

00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:36,250
so the key is API key with a capital K

00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:40,000
and then the API key itself is is the

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:43,050
value and then the payload is basically

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,230
just this J just a very simple JSON

00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:50,230
object that has the name the description

00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:52,540
the parents would be the project because

00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,429
you're creating a challenge I challenge

00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,530
lives underneath a project so you need

00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:58,450
to define the parents through the

00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:03,490
project ID but this is whether I project

00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:04,630
ID comes in a few things that I a couple

00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,520
things that I didn't pay so much

00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,710
attention to the which are not which are

00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,080
optional this is a blurb which is a kind

00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,610
of a shorter description which is

00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,130
optional so you can just leave that out

00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,480
really and then the instruction is the

00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:19,450
very important part where you tell you

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,030
is what to do and the weather it's

00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,550
enabled or not the only to Rick

00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:29,500
mandatory parts here are the name and

00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:31,630
the instruction if I'm correct I think

00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,610
I'm pretty sure that's that's correct

00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:36,310
the other things and the parent of

00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:37,660
course because otherwise it's epaulet

00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:41,770
has no way of knowing where to put it

00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:44,020
and then the response would be kind of

00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,730
basically is very similar Jason with way

00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,290
you would get an important part of

00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,060
information that you get there is the

00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:51,010
challenge ID which is new

00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:54,970
for a newly created challenge and that

00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:59,710
you will have to use in subsequent calls

00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:03,160
to to create to create tasks and and

00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:04,960
modify challenges so if you want to

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,030
update it it's the same endpoint with

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,280
with the challenge ID attached to it and

00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:12,280
that would make it a put request not a

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,860
post request everything else stays the

00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,930
same you only have to mention what you

00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,360
want what you want to what you want to

00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:21,310
change in this in this particular case I

00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,790
changed the name and I said it to

00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:27,790
enabled and the response will reflect

00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:30,760
will reflect what that that the changes

00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:33,070
were were made in this case the name has

00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,820
in fact been changed and the challenges

00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:39,780
be set to enabled so now the most

00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:43,320
exciting part is adding tasks of course

00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:45,820
this is this is where it gets well the

00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:53,220
third Jason gets a little bit more

00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:53,220
interesting it's basically a big list of

00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:01,540
tasks and the task gets each task gets a

00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:04,840
name that you assign yourself and then

00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,730
and then a geometry it's that's the

00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:11,350
minimum amount of information that it

00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:12,760
needs to be in there actually I made a

00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:16,230
little mistake here the names are

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,000
duplicated which is not which is not

00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:22,600
allowed each task needs to have a unique

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,070
unique name what map relate what map

00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,230
relate actually internally does it

00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:29,470
assigns an identifier for each task that

00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:32,620
you bet you need to that you need to use

00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:36,340
to refer to it in the future or the

00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:38,170
response is just a 201 there's no Jason

00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:43,030
there it's just a basically the fact

00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:45,160
that it's been created yeah so if you

00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:47,200
then go if you then go go back in and

00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,940
retrieve the challenges receive the task

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,610
that you just that you just made this is

00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:55,150
basically a get request with it says

00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:56,920
challenge / challenge ID / tasks you get

00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,220
all you get both those tasks back the

00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,650
ones that the one thing that's new is

00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:04,660
the task ID so there

00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,870
one there's the other and the names that

00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,490
you gave yourself so you can you can

00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:14,440
link those you then you can link those

00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:17,700
two things together you can then go

00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,920
ahead and delete a task based on its ID

00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:24,160
the ideas then wrapped into the into the

00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,930
URL here notice that there is no

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,700
reference to the to the challenge of the

00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:31,270
project in this URL this is just a

00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:34,780
direct access to the task with a HTTP

00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:36,160
delete and then a confirmation in the

00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:43,390
adjacent which is not technically

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:45,040
necessary you can also go ahead and

00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:48,670
delete your challenge again then it's

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,050
it's gone forever so it's you're free to

00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:53,580
do that of course at any point but

00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,580
realize that there's no undoing this

00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:05,620
yeah there we go a little bit of kind of

00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:10,270
metadata about this API the all of it

00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:12,610
requires authentic aqui except for the

00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:15,940
get method so you can do any you can get

00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,530
any information about the challenge and

00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,330
there's many more methods that I didn't

00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,010
really go into because they're all

00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:24,790
described into they all follow the same

00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:26,470
basic pattern they just require they

00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:31,480
just they're all described in the

00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:34,660
documentation everything that rights to

00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,980
meprolight requires the API key you can

00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,260
only operate on things in your own

00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:40,210
project obviously in terms of writing

00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,740
reading you can you can read anything

00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:44,290
out of metro led through the API

00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:47,430
anything you want but writing you can

00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:50,800
only do on things in your own project

00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:53,260
you cannot create new projects for

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:58,690
yourself you have to be a super users do

00:39:53,260 --> 00:40:00,160
that and the only super user is me you

00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,810
can ask for one though I mean maybe I'll

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,520
do it in the future I don't really see a

00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,010
great reason for people to create more

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,900
projects but if they if people want to

00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:16,150
create projects then I'll probably add

00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:18,970
it in the future some help that I would

00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,430
like on the project in general if anyone

00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:23,079
who's interested in that better

00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:25,569
discovery of challenges right now this

00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:28,000
map view I've gotten a lot of feedback

00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:29,829
about that that it's just not people are

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,630
confused when they first go into my

00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:34,539
pilot's or what where do I start what I

00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:37,599
do and they see a map with some with

00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:39,099
some markers on it so it's it's kind of

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,990
confusing the old map roulette had a

00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:42,880
list of challenges that you that they

00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:45,190
would call up and people actually like

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,829
that better so I want to bring that back

00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:52,690
it's all front end work so it's all kind

00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:54,430
of HTML Javascript CSS so all of these

00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:58,329
items actually except for the

00:40:54,430 --> 00:41:01,329
translation there's a lot of issues on

00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:04,809
github that are small bugs in the in the

00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:11,130
user interface mostly very few in the

00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:15,339
api api is pretty solid translation into

00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:17,460
your language it's the translation are

00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:20,049
simple is a simple string strings file

00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,910
that is very easy to pick up we probably

00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:26,890
put it on transifex or something like

00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:28,930
that even then of course yeah your

00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,690
feedback is immensely valuable for this

00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,279
project we really only at the start of

00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:40,299
the new version it's been out for a few

00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:42,700
months now but I I can see this I can I

00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:45,069
I still need a lot of feedback on what

00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,960
works and what doesn't so that's what

00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:51,339
I'm hoping that you will pro help me

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,549
provide as well so this is the this is

00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:55,869
the walkthrough of creating challenges

00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:57,400
if you have any like the rest of the

00:41:55,869 --> 00:42:00,599
time I would like to spend I don't know

00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,740
how much there is left but there is some

00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,569
the rest of the time I would like to

00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:06,220
spend basically for questions and

00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:08,319
discussion of course but if you're if

00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,910
you if you have already had an idea and

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,720
you want to kind of explore how to put

00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:16,180
that on my palette if you if you want to

00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,799
if you want to kind of test some ideas

00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:20,200
with me or with it with the rest of the

00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:21,460
crowd on how to create challenges yeah

00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,410
those are all I think good things to

00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,420
talk about so if you have anything and

00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:27,099
now's a great time to do it just

00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,170
pointing at this wanted to point out a

00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:29,660
few resources all those links are live

00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,549
in the

00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:34,520
in the online version of these slides so

00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:36,079
you can just click on them the github

00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,329
repository there's a mailing list

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:42,859
actually a map roulette at openstreetmap

00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:44,660
org there's it's been fairly quiet but I

00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:48,559
don't see why it would need to remain

00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:51,619
that way api examples for any of you

00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,510
using postman i created a collection

00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:56,329
postman collection to kind of run

00:42:53,510 --> 00:43:00,890
through all these api calls that you can

00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:02,450
just test it out for yourself and then

00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,980
of course again the link to the slides

00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,339
for this presentation where all these

00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:09,079
links are alive so yeah let's let's walk

00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:12,109
through a workflow of the challenge

00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:14,569
creation hope was helpful and I hope to

00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:16,970
but a lot of you will start thinking

00:43:14,569 --> 00:43:20,109
about ideas and exploring them and

00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:22,520
putting my map role in and i hope to

00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:25,069
form a polite to continue to be a great

00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,960
way to to have led to engage a lot of

00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:28,190
users to fix small things and i think

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,710
there's a lot of small things that need

00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:35,000
fixing it up a street map i know that

00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:36,680
you know that that's true so um yeah

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,990
let's let's let's use it let's start

00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,299
using it and I'm hoping this hoping to

00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:46,119
see a lot of creative challenge work out

00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:46,119
of all of you thanks

00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,349
did you questions

00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:06,820
I thank you for the presentation I'm

00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:10,720
fairly new to to all the contribution

00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:12,870
part so for instance my first

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:17,410
interaction of contributing is to use

00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:21,910
the OpenStreetMap android app click on

00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:23,650
and hold and make an edit and make a

00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:25,450
note and then i realized that the

00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:28,120
community responded in 30 minutes and

00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:30,160
then started putting things on the map

00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:33,160
for me and I said well that's fantastic

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,260
but i was thinking now could i use

00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:40,000
something similar to create a collection

00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:42,730
of potential tasks while i'm in the

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,030
field and then later on bundle them into

00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:48,660
a challenge i mean yeah i think i think

00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:50,800
that's it let's really entertain

00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:55,650
interesting idea what you could do i

00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:58,570
think probably is to do is to just use

00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:01,120
there's probably apps out there that let

00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:03,250
you make that that you i think probably

00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:06,220
osmand or something can do that where

00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,620
you can just make little field notes and

00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:19,150
then export that somehow as a Geo JSON

00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:21,040
or converted to geo JSON okay right yeah

00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:24,130
i mean the notes there's various ways of

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,440
consuming awesome notes if you there's

00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:29,230
an API an awesome API to get them to

00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,620
retrieve notes based on I think on a

00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:34,600
bounding box you can then translate that

00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:37,660
and filter it to just have your own

00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,430
tasks and then make that into a map or

00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,290
there's a little loop few nuts and bolts

00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:43,060
that you would need to create for that

00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:46,780
but it's definitely possible I think

00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:50,130
it's an interesting idea so so um yeah

00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:52,000
I'd welcome you to explore that

00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,020
basically what you need to do is

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,160
retrieve the tasks from from our sem

00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:00,810
perhaps filter them to only have your

00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:06,190
own the task is to created and then

00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:09,610
export them as goj son and then or asked

00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:11,470
osm tasks so one thing one thing that I

00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:14,530
that I had for the previous version is a

00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:16,540
is an API wrapper for

00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:20,500
Python so you could easily use the

00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:22,810
awesome the map roulette API in in

00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Python projects that doesn't yet exist

00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:28,540
for the new version i'm a board it or

00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:31,540
may not depending on how much time i

00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,760
have but right now you would need to

00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:37,330
write your own kind of access to the ocm

00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,000
api which is definitely doable and and

00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:44,320
create something like that yeah why not

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:49,030
it's think it's a great idea that good

00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:51,190
point really a simple way to do this as

00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:53,230
just use maps me book smart bookmarks

00:46:51,190 --> 00:47:00,150
export them as kml and convert them to

00:46:53,230 --> 00:47:00,150
geo Jason you're good to go yeah I

00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:08,140
checked quickly the map relates are some

00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,820
terms like projects and surveys also in

00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:13,720
addition to challenges can you explain

00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:17,710
it sorry but with the project n 1 at the

00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:20,260
surveys our surveys yeah so that's a

00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:21,640
part I didn't cover so that's sort of it

00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:25,690
that's a little bit of a mapper let

00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:27,880
future that you see there um one thing I

00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,320
we've been working on it's not it's

00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,440
we're not quite there yet this the

00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,090
survey so check the traditional

00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,330
challenges work like this right so where

00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:39,610
you you see it on the map you go to ID

00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:43,740
or joslynne fix it go back to my poor

00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:46,570
lettuce and and and say okay I fix it

00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:49,590
survey challenges that don't really

00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:52,120
exist yet in the in the user interface

00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:55,150
work a little differently they basically

00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,940
provide the user with with pre-death

00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:00,310
with we could see it as a yes or no

00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,560
question so you basically metal that

00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,960
would be turned into a question and

00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:10,060
answer machine so basically you would

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:11,920
say for example does this building still

00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:14,830
exists based on what you see on the

00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,980
underlying aerial or satellite images

00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:21,520
and if the user clicks yes then he goes

00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:24,550
on to the next task if the user clicks

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,730
no then the building would be removed

00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:28,340
from osm

00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:30,470
without you having to go in and edit it

00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,730
so it would become more like map swipe

00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:34,520
or something like that where you have

00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:37,010
really quick question and answer like it

00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:40,520
can you see this or can't you is this

00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:42,619
right or is this wrong so that's that's

00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,869
actually a pretty interesting addition

00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:47,480
to map relate that would make it that

00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:49,910
would make it possible to have tasks

00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:52,070
that are much that can be used that

00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:54,560
users can solve much quicker and do all

00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:56,990
kinds of interesting validation type

00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,730
stuff but again there's no user

00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:02,480
interface for it yet and so that needs

00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:03,830
to be written still but it's thanks for

00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:10,310
pointing it out because I actually

00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:13,400
wanted to mention it I keep finding

00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:16,940
duplicates for example let's say two

00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,140
British embassies in Paris so one must

00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,900
be the original one must be the

00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:23,000
duplicate but each task I can only give

00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:25,300
one object can add an ad in the

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,530
description it's just a duplicate of X

00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,450
because this might be the original and

00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:31,520
the other one might be the duplicate now

00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:35,060
you can add multiple objects for each

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:37,910
task and the Geo JSON for a task or the

00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:41,660
I think through the few use the wizard

00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:44,390
that will be hard because through over

00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:48,680
past queries there's no way to link or

00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:50,810
correct get get responses that represent

00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:54,230
multiple objects but through the API if

00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:57,500
you create tasks the geometry is the Geo

00:49:54,230 --> 00:50:01,910
Jason part of the of the task of the

00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:05,000
task object think we can contain

00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:08,000
multiple geometries if you want there's

00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,040
even you can even have each each object

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,020
can have its own little balloon up pop

00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:16,220
up balloons if the user clicks on it

00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:18,320
they can see which is which so there's

00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,550
definitely ways you could do that just

00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,320
not through the wizard you would have to

00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:27,260
use the API to add tasks that have

00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:29,740
multiple geometries now of their

00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,740
questions

00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:41,180
can I have different instructions for

00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:44,990
each task yeah it's a good question yes

00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,760
you can by default it will populate so

00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,470
in the wizard you said you saw that

00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,089
there's only one instruction field for

00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:52,220
the entire challenge but you can

00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:53,599
especially if you use the API you could

00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,460
you could have different instructions

00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,769
for each task and that can actually be

00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:00,049
really useful if you have tasks that

00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:02,200
need specific information like I can let

00:51:00,049 --> 00:51:04,760
the image example that you know earlier

00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,859
then you can do individual instructions

00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,200
for each task so it will have a default

00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:10,789
instruction and if you don't override it

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,440
it will just use that but if you can

00:51:10,789 --> 00:51:17,380
overwrite if you override it for a task

00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,380
and yeah you can have different ones yep

00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:31,549
okay anyone one other questions ok we

00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:34,549
ask one question so with my beretta you

00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:38,059
say ok we can make the task but not so

00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:40,910
huge I can imagine as you said that one

00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:45,799
of directors and task a tutorial as it's

00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:48,769
not so I would say so present but well

00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:52,400
could we imagine to have a huge cat task

00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:55,930
like okay completely crazy making

00:51:52,400 --> 00:52:00,559
language accurate ok but splitting

00:51:55,930 --> 00:52:03,710
sufficiently splitting up a sufficiently

00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:06,980
so that we have say what a great or what

00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:10,039
doesn't task like I would say for

00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:16,400
example just the residential in the one

00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:18,230
area and so on yeah again like if you as

00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,470
long as the tasks themselves are simple

00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:24,289
and and you can solve them within a very

00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:28,759
reasonable small amount of time and the

00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:31,039
and the total number of tasks in your

00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:35,029
challenge is not huge I think that yeah

00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:36,410
any as long as you adhere to those basic

00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:37,730
rules I mean they're not hard rules

00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,079
right if you want to make a challenge

00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,660
that as a hundred thousand tasks I've

00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:44,740
done it before we had a we had a

00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:47,050
railroad railroad crossings challenge

00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:49,460
like in the US

00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:51,320
sorry I have a lot of us examples it's

00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:54,890
just because where I did most of the

00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:56,540
data analysis in the past and that's how

00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:57,500
my production got started this is a

00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:02,950
little bit of a tangent that's

00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:05,360
interesting I think so as you know us Oh

00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:08,890
same data got started with the tiger

00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:12,140
import back in two thousand seven eight

00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:14,810
that's a big mess it still is in many

00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:20,200
parts and then we had the license change

00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:22,760
in that movie was concluded in 2012 and

00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,310
as as you probably know we couldn't

00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,500
reach a whole lot of users to get them

00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:29,060
to agree with the license change and all

00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,350
their data had to be removed so we had

00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,730
all these gaps in the data and that's

00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:36,800
actually how my pool at first got

00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:38,090
started so I found I identified all the

00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,260
places where data had been removed

00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:44,630
without specifically without without

00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:46,460
having the data itself and I asked

00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:49,460
people through what later became napoo

00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:51,530
led to look at this part and readd the

00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:56,750
way that was missing the road that was

00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:59,260
missing so but so that's how my people

00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:02,240
that got started getting back on track

00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:04,280
we have this this real world challenge

00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,680
where the tiger data has all these

00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,850
railways and it had the normal roads but

00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,620
there weren't drunk crossing markings

00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:14,650
and even the roads were disconnected the

00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:17,600
railroads in the and irregular roads

00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:19,910
were disconnected and so we have this

00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:24,350
challenge that contain 120,000 think

00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:26,930
cases where the railroads were just

00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:29,830
crossing the regular roads and there was

00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:32,060
no railroad crossing and those who got

00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:34,730
people seem to be very annoyed by this

00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:37,490
apparently so those got fixed pretty

00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:40,100
quickly not all of them but we got

00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:41,810
through quite a lot of them so that was

00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,670
one example of a challenge that was

00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:45,200
pretty huge but I think if as long as

00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:47,240
the tasks are simple enough and you get

00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,100
a lot of people interested in it then

00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,480
who knows you might be able to solve

00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:54,590
something that has a hundred thousand

00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,470
tasks pretty quickly so just okay you

00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:58,170
took the eggs

00:54:55,470 --> 00:55:01,130
ample of tigers in the US the example

00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:05,040
was the thinking of it Corrine langevin

00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:07,080
euro actually which is a mall as the

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,910
same completely inaccurate if I could

00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,460
see ya yeah as long as you can come up

00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:13,650
with good targeted questions about about

00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,270
but the stuff that is missing you might

00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:17,550
even want to split it up in different

00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:19,310
types of problems that it exists

00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:22,080
especially the land cover data sets

00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:26,609
they're really tricky there's been a lot

00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:27,930
of discussion around the can vac imports

00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:29,340
that happened in Canada people

00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:31,109
complaining about that I mean it's just

00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,280
tricky so there's a lot of problems and

00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:34,109
I think some of these problems are

00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:37,820
really interesting to solve with with

00:55:34,109 --> 00:55:41,310
the tool like Metro lid so yeah I have a

00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:45,930
I'm hoping I'm hoping people get get

00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:48,690
creative with it again yeah so there's

00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:51,060
there's no more questions I want to

00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:53,880
thank you very much for your interest

00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:55,109
and just let me know at any time if you

00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,099
want to know more if you want to work

00:55:55,109 --> 00:56:01,410
with me to create challenges there's a

00:55:58,099 --> 00:56:04,020
there's a the side for the mailing list

00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:08,180
there's also the awesome us slack
