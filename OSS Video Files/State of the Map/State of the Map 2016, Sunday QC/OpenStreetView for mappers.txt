Title: OpenStreetView for mappers
Publication date: 2016-10-21
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Sunday QC
Description: 
	Martijn van Exel and Alex Ilisei at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/openstreetview-for-mappers/

OpenStreetView is the free and open street level imagery platform designed 100% with OSM mappers in mind. In this workshop, we will walk you through all the components of OSV: the open source mobile apps, the OSV editor, JOSM plugins, and web site. We hope to also be able to show you an early version of iD integration. Once we get that out of the way, we will look at some tips and tricks specific to mapping with OSV, and there will be lots of time to answer all your questions around the OSV platform. Bring your laptop and smartphones!

to the users through a set of osm

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,790
integrations that consists of jawsome

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,809
plug-in ID integration that we're

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,360
working on and a special specialized

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,980
editing desktop application that we're

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,310
also working on them hoping the shell a

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,590
little bit and then of course it goes

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,010
into Allison so that's that's it in a

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:30,150
nutshell and let's talk about some of

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:34,590
those components a little bit more so

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:37,649
the apps are Android and iOS for Android

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,690
we have availability through the place

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,239
to play and app stores but also for

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,340
Android we can do we offer a APK

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,570
download and of course you can compile

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,730
the whole thing yourself if you're so

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,590
inclined if you just download the stores

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,719
called and do it this is some overview

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,370
of some of the screens that look pretty

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,410
similar on on each platform there are

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,059
slight differences some features get on

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,160
Android first some features get on iOS

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,619
for her first we're we're pretty rapid

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,810
development cycle very very publish new

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,570
versions every two weeks or so right now

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,979
and some things make it onto Android

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,720
first and some things make it onto iOS

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,060
first so it depends but we're definitely

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,700
not having one a preference for one

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,430
platform over the other they're both

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:23,729
equally well developed and tested so you

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,000
see here to the left is a view of like

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,159
the default the list a list of captures

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,170
that are already existing and to the

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,409
right in the location and to the right

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,360
you see the an overview of one trip with

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,680
with the trace on the top and then you

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,829
can scroll through you can scrub through

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,570
the images in the bottom it actually

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,750
goes pretty fast if you want to review

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,780
your sequence on the phone you can just

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,520
scrub through that and then it will show

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,890
almost like a video will show the images

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,110
I had a nice animation of that but I

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,920
don't think it made it into the PDF that

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,520
I would have put the would have been

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,810
this one here but the slides are all in

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,250
line I'll share the link later you can

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,570
review it in its full glory there so

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,750
this is the Rick this is the recording

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,680
stuff so you can switch between the

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,659
camera view

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,819
as the main view and the map view is the

00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:17,439
main view actually what's not shown here

00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,150
and what we instance implemented if you

00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,340
have the map view you can also see aware

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,230
the where we already have coverage so if

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,700
you want to take a lift to go into a

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,790
street where there's no coverage yet

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,859
then you can do that pretty easy by

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,109
looking at the map it shows a little bit

00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:33,370
of metrics of the current trip how many

00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:36,939
pictures you've captured how many

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,400
megabytes that has been taking up so far

00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:41,680
and then how many kilometers or miles we

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,590
actually let you switch between those

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,319
and I love that because I always get

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,970
confused as a European American between

00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:53,139
miles and kilometers and I want to

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:55,870
switch from time to time uploading and

00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:58,000
this happens automatically when you if

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,310
you set it to do so and you

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,010
you're-you're you come within Wi-Fi

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:08,919
range it will start uploading your

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:10,540
Europe you're finished trips and if you

00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,239
want to use mobile data you can even do

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,799
that but most people are unlimited data

00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,139
plans so they wouldn't want to do that

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:21,519
probably so that's why we offer it on

00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:23,409
Wi-Fi only by default and then there's a

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,519
little profile screen this is kind of a

00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:26,409
condensed version of what's on the

00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,810
website that shows your current ranking

00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:31,599
and your weekly ranking this is

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,060
currently global we have plans to make

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,590
that a little more localized also and

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,840
then if you scroll down you would see

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,829
you would see an overview of your recent

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:46,090
captures so this is how this is also

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:48,790
supposed to be a funny and animated but

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,239
like the who have you have seen the HBO

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,829
show Silicon Valley that they're all

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,409
about like creating this next-generation

00:03:53,829 --> 00:04:00,250
compression platform and we're pretty

00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:02,470
proud of the achievement that we think

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,680
are pretty Pied Piper ish and that we

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,930
that we were able to do compress an

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,840
eight megapixel image into two smaller

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,849
than one megabyte by doing mp4 video

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,139
compression on the device so we uploaded

00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:17,199
actually uploaded the sequence as a

00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:19,900
video and then it gets an unwind at

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,789
uncompressed into images again on the

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,979
server side so it's really smooth upload

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,430
and it's very fast weren't you supposed

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:30,820
to be talking about this

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,370
when I get going then it's all good

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,260
night so yeah I'm pretty excited about

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,500
the video compression we quite like we

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:41,590
worked a lot on that so we got to less

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:45,389
than half of individual JPEGs without

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:50,199
any loss of quality so it's pretty cool

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:53,290
one other thing that we we did that is

00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,600
exciting for me is so this is what what

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,449
you see when you open the website or the

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,960
app so this is one poly line for each

00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:05,500
Street segment that was mapped and what

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,840
this means is that we aggregate every

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,070
every GPS trace that we receive and

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,840
match it to to sm road network so

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:16,810
instead of this this is I think you're

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,350
familiar with this kind of setup so you

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:23,740
see every GPS trace on a map and it kind

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:27,220
of jumps around and does crazy stuff and

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,710
it doesn't look that good you end up

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:33,550
with this it's much cleaner and you see

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:36,220
exactly what was what was mapped so far

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:39,550
so when you just click on a on a

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:42,280
specific location only then you'll see

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,220
all the pictures they're all the tracks

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,110
or the sequences that were were recorded

00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,470
in that area so as you see these all

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,510
these four images on the bottom you can

00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,030
scroll around through them these were

00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:58,720
all taken by different people at the

00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:01,660
same the same location so this is quite

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,470
cool yeah I'll let Martin talk a little

00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,270
bit about the computer vision thing yeah

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,400
one I wanted to go back before I do that

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:17,220
so what's nice about this is that we

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:19,930
actually match the the trips to osm ways

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,300
internally so what that gives us is that

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:25,990
every Oh same way is already attached on

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,729
our side it's already linked to to a set

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,479
of images that what's was taken on that

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:30,479
on that trip

00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,400
okay and say okay we have we have this

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,919
many pictures and they're of this age so

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,990
you can attach like you can that you can

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,220
you can quickly retrieve images that are

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,830
attached to a specific all the same way

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,949
so there's no there's no need to kind of

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,570
guess so you can do that you can you can

00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:53,419
do that programmatically as well if you

00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,970
want we get into the API stuff later but

00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:57,289
that's a that's something that is yeah

00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,550
that's core to a platform and one of

00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,220
those things that really defines the

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,840
integration with awesome is that we

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,229
everything is basically attached to all

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,570
same ways natively already but yeah so

00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:11,539
the M we're doing we're doing we've

00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:16,400
spent quite a bit of time on on computer

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:18,229
vision and detecting signs this is still

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,880
very much a work in progress also we're

00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,370
continuing to work on this right now we

00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,180
have when we have speed speed sound

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:29,630
detection for the US and the EU let's

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:32,150
work that's that's fully working we're

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,370
working on so the next step and I think

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,900
it's a pretty big one would be to work

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,599
on the signpost you know the big

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,870
overhead things on freeways that not not

00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:44,479
only detecting them but in the end also

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:47,060
even interpreting what they say and if

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,280
anyone has ever mapped those destination

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,260
signs or this destination tags in

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,470
awesome you can you know how the complex

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,110
cells can get and we're trying to figure

00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,120
out if we can kind of a semi automate

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,250
art of that process by detecting what's

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,940
on the signs that's kind of this kind of

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,500
stuff but we're working through that

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,860
also Lane Lane detection so how many

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:13,190
lanes Lane configuration that's that's

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,750
important to us at least as well but if

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,220
you if you have suggestions on what we

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,419
should be detecting we're all ears also

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,720
so what that what that speed limit

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,909
detection gives you it actually doesn't

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,310
happen on the server this is also a

00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:32,570
little bit I think pretty pretty

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:35,599
interesting is that happens at 40 50 55

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,099
frames per second on the client so we

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,110
built the computer vision library right

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,810
into the clients on the Android and the

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,620
iOS clients and the detection happens in

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:46,740
real time so what happens if you

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,810
if a speed sign is detected it could it

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,520
could and it will also warn you if

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,950
you're speeding for example so it it

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:57,360
helps with you driving more safely as

00:08:52,950 --> 00:09:01,140
well and this is I think you need to to

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,050
open Street View I to do this in real

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,060
time is a it's been a pretty huge

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,610
accomplishment and we're I'm pretty

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,230
happy about that that we can do that and

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,089
to the right you see a little bit of a

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,040
preview of what I was hoping to show you

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:15,210
a little bit more off but because we

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,060
don't have our own computers here we

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:21,180
have to do that kind of here at the

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,589
table if you're interested this is a map

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,880
editor that we're developing and we're

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:26,480
testing currently internally and we're

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,580
hoping to release in the in a in a

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,860
couple months a few months which

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,450
basically does loads a trip you see

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,000
basically the slider that shows the

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,650
entire trip and there in the bottom what

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,089
you see is the locations where signs

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,740
have been detected so you can quickly

00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,110
jump through those and will actually

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,150
retrieve the current value from lsm for

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,240
the speed limits and you can quickly

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:50,420
apply the new speed limit to to all the

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,120
same if you want to so this would help

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:56,279
too much more efficiently you can map

00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,920
map the speed limits that that are that

00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,890
have been detected and to the left you

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,060
see an overview of like the little

00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:05,400
thumbnails of their or basically that

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,870
that the crop of the image whether that

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,730
shows where the sound was detected so

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:14,700
you can quickly see if we if we mess it

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:17,100
up which happens so this is a little bit

00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,400
of a kind of the under the hood vision

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,370
of how that computer vision works and

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,600
how it how it distinguishes road from

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:29,640
from the rest and how we how we looking

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,380
at not only detecting signs but also

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,959
kind of the road geometry and how it

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,970
curves which is more which is not so

00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,200
much interesting perhaps for for also

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,420
aimed directly at least not in its

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,279
grinch current form but it's um it's

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,320
definitely interesting for kind of more

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,140
higher resolution mapping where you

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,580
where you depend on maps for for a semi

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:52,940
autonomous driving and stuff like that

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:54,880
so that's where it gets interesting me

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,600
me

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:02,200
it was was who has heard about this obd2

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:06,430
port in their cars um who is with who

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,230
owns a car here I mean like I've I i

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,500
only have bought my first car when i

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,420
moved to the united states pretty much

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,850
except for a clunker that i owned in

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,440
amsterdam for a couple years but so

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,200
every car every car pretty much if

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,240
you're if it's not very very old we'll

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,680
have a board like this it's usually by

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,020
your knees if you're in the driver's

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,350
seat by your left knee somewhere by the

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:32,290
fuse box sometimes it's covered by a

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,780
panel and this is basically a diagnostic

00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,480
sport so what it does is it reads out

00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:41,950
all kinds of values from from the car as

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:46,540
it as it moves so it it reads current

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:49,480
gas consumption the speed they all kinds

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,460
of engine metrics but also the current

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,920
curve that a current curve of the

00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:58,620
steering wheel basically and so this

00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,790
information is useful for enhancing the

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,470
accuracy of the GPS everybody knows that

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,410
phone GFE gps's are not the most

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,750
accurate ones and with with the help of

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,930
the speed information as well as the as

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:14,530
well as the curve of the current curve

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:17,260
of the car the current steering curve we

00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:19,150
can enhance the accuracy of that signal

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,230
and do better map matching but also we

00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:25,600
can use dead reckoning to get us get

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,070
continue the trip if if the GPS signal

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,080
is lost altogether so think about

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,810
driving through a tunnel think about

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,560
driving in a dense inner city area

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:39,970
impart GPS is poor or tree coverage and

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:42,460
this will then help to maintain a good

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:48,340
trip signal and a good trace for your

00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:51,850
for your for your osv trip so here's a

00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,050
here's what that shows you someone's

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,740
driving through a tunnel i covered the

00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:59,470
bird poop on the window with the thing

00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:02,020
you see the the non enhanced trace is in

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,970
kind of purple pink and then the

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,910
enhanced race with obd2 where it just

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,380
follows the tunnel pretty much exactly

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,090
is on the right

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,100
so this is a tunnel in Berlin and the GP

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,260
GPS trace is just lost and it goes

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,660
straight and wood to where it picks up

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,610
again where's the audio obd2 enhanced

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,320
raise good follows the follows the

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,670
entire thing pretty much exactly so

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,100
that's the kind of benefit that you get

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:28,150
from that and I think that's a pretty

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,620
significant one especially if you think

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:34,530
about the others I mean there's there's

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:38,290
quite a few locations where where a more

00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:40,900
accurate signal is really helpful not

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,520
only in tunnels but also in places where

00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,260
relative very close together so map

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,190
matching becomes very ambiguous so any

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,900
increase in accuracy that you can

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,610
achieve is how it going to be helpful to

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:56,740
to have better map matching and being

00:13:51,610 --> 00:14:00,330
able to definitively tie always always V

00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:03,310
imagery to to individual out same ways

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,500
so the app supports both Wi-Fi and

00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,210
Bluetooth Low Energy dongles so not the

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,490
regular Bluetooth once if you want to go

00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:12,040
out and buy one today so look for a

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,570
Bluetooth Low Energy one those are more

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,810
expensive than the regular Bluetooth

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:19,240
ones the Wi-Fi ones have sometimes the

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,890
disadvantage that you that you have to

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,720
maintain if you want to maintain

00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,720
internet connectivity you might have to

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,740
perform some tricks to do that but and

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,720
this is the one that I use myself and

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,370
that works works very well on the way on

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,240
the ocean wiki we started the page to

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:39,220
have to UM to list out compatible models

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,820
that we have tested and that the users

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:47,590
have tested and let me give it to Alex

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:51,310
now okay so a few words about the

00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:55,690
open-source activity we released all the

00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:59,140
code about a month ago at the state of

00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:03,220
the map us so this is where the code is

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:05,110
it's yeah it's PDF messed up the link

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,260
but you can get on here so it's github

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:12,850
com / Open Street View and what you'll

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:17,110
find there is the iOS app Android app

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:20,170
the all the code of the website jasm

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,180
plugin upload tool and the scripts for

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,149
for upload those are some pie

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:28,480
the scripts Martin will mention about

00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:32,230
those later and the map editor to that

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,600
Martin show then he'll will try to do

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,850
some demo but we can't connect our

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,930
computer to this thing so we'll see how

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:46,209
that goes so yeah basically it's it's

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:50,080
it's all there we have over 90 issues

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:52,630
that were reported by people and osv

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,350
users which is which is great we we try

00:15:52,630 --> 00:16:02,800
to maintain an active conversation there

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:05,790
we had a 14 Forks yeah just combined so

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,589
we're quite happy with that we

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:12,430
definitely encourage you guys to go

00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:18,070
there and and I don't know check out the

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:22,810
code tell us tell us things we

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:27,250
definitely encourage contributions just

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:29,830
like some suggestions that are easy to

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,839
do some for some people so we're looking

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,880
into translating the apps we don't have

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,040
a lot of resources right now internally

00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,010
to do translations in all the languages

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,380
but we know that OSN people are

00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:45,150
everywhere so we can we encourage this

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:49,240
trench translation thing we are actually

00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:51,820
looking for someone who can i convert

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,100
like convert the upload tool to linux

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,220
it's a cutie tool so if anyone knows

00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:01,870
cutie we're looking forward to a

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:06,819
conversation we now have windows and and

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:10,750
Mac and of course any crazy ideas that

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:14,699
come that come to mind we're we're there

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:16,660
we can we can talk actually i'll have

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,780
the next section of the presentation

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,870
i'll talk about the api that we were now

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:25,839
releasing it wasn't available until

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:29,230
until now so i'll i'll talk about that

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:34,360
and see what you guys can build with

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:35,760
that we had we had the before state of

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,090
the map you has us

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:43,740
a better program where I don't maybe

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:46,080
some of you joined Martin organized that

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,160
that that whole thing you want to tell a

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,740
few words about yeah that was that's

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,020
been very useful I love beta programs I

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,460
love to take part in them so I was I was

00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,110
excited to get finally be able to

00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,480
organize one so we had about 50 people

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:03,330
from the awesome community that some of

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,860
them like yeah because it wasn't public

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,920
yet I just reached out to folks that I

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:12,090
knew or folks that I knew would be

00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,370
interested based on knowing people in

00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,650
the awesome community if you if you're

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,590
if you weren't part of that yet and it's

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,180
not too late if you wanna will continue

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,410
it after the now another we launched

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,240
we're still continue eating it's a

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,590
little good quiet right now just because

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,940
we're focusing on catching up with all

00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,330
the issues that have been reported since

00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,100
we went public but we still be will be

00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,230
continued to push new improvements their

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,660
first in the future so if you want to

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,840
join that I think yeah we will

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:42,480
definitely take more people as long as

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:47,100
you're willing to live it on the edge a

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,660
little bit and we did we did get a lot

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,030
of feedback from that in terms of

00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,500
usability of the apps mainly because we

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,090
focus we're focusing on the app's that's

00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,990
was the only user facing part that we

00:18:54,090 --> 00:19:03,810
had and we made it much better because

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:05,520
of that already oh yeah so this workshop

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,870
was called off the street view from

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,990
mappers so let's talk about those

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:13,050
mapping tools a little bit um I would

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,430
love to do a demo that's not going to be

00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,230
possible just because we have to present

00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,120
from this thing here but I have the

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,220
things on my computer that doesn't bug

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,160
plugin you can download yourself already

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,450
of course and i'm just going to show

00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,450
some screenshots for those who haven't

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,250
seen it yet and then we have we have

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,520
this map editor tool that i briefly

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:36,450
mentioned and that i that i want to talk

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,430
a little bit more about so the justin

00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,020
plugin that's basically you can you can

00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,480
you can see what it does here so it's

00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,180
it's very rudimentary so far so it's

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,919
it's it's it's um it's simple but what

00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,989
work but works well

00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,359
and we're hoping to present this as a

00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:54,509
start of basically how what should this

00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,879
be what should this be looking like our

00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:58,470
main developer for for that plug-in bay

00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:00,989
i was presenting yesterday and she's in

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,639
the room here also so um i don't know

00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:07,850
how grown up I don't know hope I don't

00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:10,200
mess up her work it's basically

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:14,129
discoverable through the jawsome plugins

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,299
store where you can download it like any

00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,820
other plug-in it doesn't have any

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:21,989
dependencies that I know of in terms of

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:24,210
other plugins and then yeah what it does

00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:26,519
is basically what it says on the tin its

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:30,690
present you with basically a cloud of

00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:34,320
existing images in in with what we don't

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:37,019
do yet for example is is is clustering

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,489
so you see this whole mess of images so

00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,220
it only really useful if you zoom in

00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:43,859
pretty far you can you can you can

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,330
select an individual image and and and

00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:50,580
display it for for mapping purposes I

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:52,980
think enough you can do a couple filters

00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,529
age filter for the images as well as

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:58,289
filter only your own images because of

00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:04,769
course you love to map your own stuff

00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:06,600
first it's a work in progress in the

00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:08,009
sense like there's a few things that I

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,769
definitely would like to see improved

00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:14,580
already and that we're working on it's

00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:15,989
in in the near future so the currently

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,249
the awesome layer needs to be are the

00:21:15,989 --> 00:21:19,340
obviously do layer needs to be the

00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:21,989
active layer for it to be for it to be

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,600
selectable so you need to switch layers

00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:26,129
quite a bit this is an active discussion

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,039
on github already people pointed this

00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:32,309
out and we're and I quickly discovered

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,499
that I wanted that different also like I

00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:35,879
said no trips so there's just individual

00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:37,379
images so you can't really easily skip

00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:40,590
to the next image you have to click on

00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:43,830
it in the in the map view no clustering

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,080
aggregation no sign integration yet so

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,269
so we're really at the start of this but

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,580
it's definitely use useful usable so i

00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:55,169
invite you to download it if your plugin

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:56,849
developer like anything we very much

00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:59,280
welcome in contributions but we're very

00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:01,980
committed to also working it ourselves

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,810
and bear loves this stuff this so so

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:10,560
we're definitely going to be working on

00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:12,120
it after we get back from Brussels I'm

00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,330
going to pause for a moment and see if

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:18,510
anyone has any questions so far Dermot I

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,640
knew I could count on you just because

00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,370
it's 75 minutes I don't want to be

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,470
that's to be talking all the time sure

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,760
so I think it looks really good I'm

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,690
interested in two things one of them

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,070
really basic and simple so the

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,810
screenshots showed a lot of images of

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,200
upright phones in portrait orientation

00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,460
was that for artistic purposes or do you

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:45,180
actually think that that's a good way to

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:47,220
shoot this kind of imagery and no it

00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,600
needs a sense that it's not the idea the

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,920
best way to do it is just so have you

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:57,900
camera in landscape mode it is it is

00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:59,070
just for for presentation purposes the

00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,690
real question I think it's a

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,180
particularly useful thing this

00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:05,130
aggregation to the osm ways I punched

00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,750
the air little when you said that but

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,870
I'm interested in a particular twist on

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,280
that because I guess these ways are

00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,440
constantly in refinement and the

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,440
geometry can change so in a case like

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,930
that do you what do you trust you do a

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,850
one-time snap of the image to away and

00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:23,550
then it moves with the way or if the way

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:28,410
moves will you re-evaluate where it may

00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:33,270
be belongs is this what me yeah it's

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:36,120
working so what who is like periodically

00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:38,580
update all the matching so it's not like

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,060
daily but it's not one time so we do

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:45,300
kind of like about once every two weeks

00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:54,660
once every three weeks so it's pretty

00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:57,060
accurate about the same topic can I flag

00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:05,610
images not to be matched to away because

00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:09,030
they aren't along away we automatically

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:11,010
detect what what belongs to annoy same

00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,010
way and whatnot so

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:16,800
if something is not matchable we'll just

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,830
leave it raw so we kind of do that

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:23,400
automatically right now I I know it's

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:25,560
not one hundred percent process I think

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,570
it's actually a good idea to have

00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,120
something like that too much to flag

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:34,590
that okay this is not much but we don't

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,700
currently do that yeah no it's

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,040
definitely something that was mentioned

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,280
a few times already by users who are

00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,830
especially users were biking and saw

00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,480
their traces match to roads that are

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,030
kind of on either side of a separated

00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,690
bike path because we don't match to bike

00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:53,970
paths but only 22 to navigable what we

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,770
call navigable roads so there's there's

00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:00,030
definitely some some tuning to be done

00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:03,900
there it's maybe even an option to to do

00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:05,580
not match if you choose not to to make

00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,500
that user selectable is something that

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,100
that that I've been thinking about we

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:20,370
might that we might consider also so

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:22,950
yeah work in progress um i was looking

00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:25,650
at up street view in some stretch

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,930
coefficients it opens there and I saw a

00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,730
whole lot of pictures upside down are

00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:36,990
you working on detecting whether or not

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:39,270
they're after a time so yeah in San

00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,970
Francisco mostly we've noticed that so

00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:44,880
what happened is that we have those

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:49,610
pictures come from older bills that had

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:52,140
some problems we're working on that will

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:56,280
for those pictures will have to manually

00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:58,020
rotate them but so if anyone wants to

00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,860
rotate photos you can do that on our

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:04,530
website go to San Francisco but yeah

00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,660
that bug was fixed but we have we have

00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:15,480
the picture so we'll have to rotate and

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:19,710
manually actually very quickly one how

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:22,620
about privacy do you blur faces license

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:24,509
plate and so on and second what do you

00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,329
do in traffic jams

00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:29,549
is the app automatically detect again

00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:41,869
posing from capturing additional images

00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:47,729
in the same thought okay blurring yes

00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:50,969
the we currently do faces and license

00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:52,349
plates as so this is hard to get

00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:54,989
completely right and we do have also

00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:57,619
false positives where we blur valuable

00:26:54,989 --> 00:27:00,749
things so this is something that needs

00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:02,190
tweaking still and as we get more data

00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:04,859
this will get this will get better

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,509
because we learned from from this from

00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:08,429
the stuff that is not yet working

00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:10,709
correctly so we it's also dependent on

00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:12,149
people flagging the false positives in

00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:15,569
the end which is something that we're

00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:17,549
working on also terms of traffic I think

00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:21,479
what you're asking was the weather the

00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:23,069
weather we prevent the camera from

00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:25,769
taking too many images when you're going

00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:29,759
slow yeah no it's all the interval is

00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:31,169
all speed and distance dependent so as

00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,059
you go slower it will slow down the

00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:34,289
frequency also so there's not going to

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:37,889
be if you're if you're at a standstill

00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:40,440
or you've stop and go traffic then there

00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:43,409
will still be a good regular frequency

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:49,829
in terms of space of the images were

00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:51,539
taken with the app okay doubt yeah up

00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:53,399
there on the other question but you know

00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,569
there's all but there's also opportunity

00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:55,949
later I mean that we have to see you

00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:57,809
have more stuff to do I just wanted to

00:27:55,949 --> 00:28:02,429
have a break if you if you if you want

00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:05,039
to do one more that I can do that will

00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:07,469
the Android app also be available on f

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,869
droid yes this is something we've been

00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:11,309
looking into and with them yeah I think

00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:14,279
you yeah you might be you might be a

00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:17,849
mistake that more we definitely want to

00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:19,559
upload it on asteroid the problem right

00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:21,329
now is that we have to clean up a little

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,739
bit because you have to have all the

00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:25,199
code open source there's and we have

00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:28,709
some like binaries for crash reporting

00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:31,049
for like third-party tools that we that

00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:33,509
we use that are not core to open studio

00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:35,140
so we have to clean that up a little bit

00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:37,080
and then upload to after this is

00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,420
definitely something that we want to do

00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:47,290
in the meantime we can you can install

00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:49,870
the apk directly cool more time for

00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,700
questions later for sure I just wanted

00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:55,390
to break it up a little bit so the

00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:59,350
upload tools so some of you myself

00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:01,540
included like to put action cameras on

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:04,030
their cars or bikes and take images that

00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,740
way I have a GoPro and you can set it to

00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,750
take an image every second and you can

00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,520
kind of store a bunch until the battery

00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:13,960
runs out which is annoying me fast and a

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:17,020
GoPro camera but a lot of people do this

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,520
and we we wanted to have tools for that

00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,230
so we have we have a couple thing we

00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,660
have some Python scripts that you can

00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:26,710
use if you're if you're a command-line

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,470
person those are fairly straightforward

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:32,770
to use on all them the images that

00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:35,230
really only need lat long they don't

00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:39,090
need direction so we compute that from

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:41,080
the from the from the from the sequence

00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,120
those have gone through an iteration

00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,940
some iterations of improvements based on

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,380
feedback already and that place to give

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,540
that feedback is of course again on the

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,540
github repository where you can also

00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,280
download them another thing that we had

00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:58,350
we had a had a few interns working on

00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:01,900
this for a few for for for a while is a

00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:04,870
graphical upload tool that currently is

00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:08,560
compiled for windows and mac but

00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:10,540
actually tried my hand at compiling it

00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,800
for did you see that that I tried my

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,640
hand at compiling it for linux and it

00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,320
almost works it almost so we need

00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,420
someone who did it we just has a little

00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,290
bit more experience in compiling a cutie

00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,790
app for for linux so i got it to work

00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,810
but it just the authentication is kind

00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:31,030
of messed up so we're very close i know

00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:34,930
that there's a lot of linux users here

00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:38,740
and i am in spite of this thing I'm a

00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:41,620
pretty experienced linux user myself but

00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,450
this what this does back on topic what

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,280
this does is you basically drop a folder

00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:48,950
of images it can be huge it can be small

00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,690
and you send you have to authenticate

00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,059
with osm once because all the

00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,830
authentication for openstreetmap goes

00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:57,649
for open Street View goes through osm

00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:59,510
Roth so there's no separate account for

00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:01,130
for open street view of course we create

00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,470
an account but there's no separate login

00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:05,990
credentials so it's tied to your oh same

00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,330
account and all the information that we

00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,490
store about you is just information

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:13,490
that's publicly available through osm as

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:17,419
well so so yeah that's a little bit on

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:20,720
that as a sideline and basically yeah

00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:22,789
from there on it's very simple you just

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,190
click use click start upload and you

00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:28,190
wait for that progress bar to reach

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:30,230
hundred percent and then it's done right

00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,690
now it's like there's there's a few kind

00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,460
of dev Devi items there so like you can

00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,570
upload to a staging and a test server

00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,659
that is probably not going to be very

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:41,320
useful for many people but but this is a

00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:43,820
this is going to be kind of a more

00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,529
simpler simple way to upload a lot of

00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:49,309
images for a lot of people so we hope

00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:51,320
that's going to be useful so then

00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:52,730
something already mentioned a little bit

00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,549
is the open studio editor which is

00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:58,789
currently in an internal alpha mode that

00:31:55,549 --> 00:32:01,700
we hope to expand on and release to the

00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:04,730
to the public this is also cutie tool

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:08,750
which so it should be it always is

00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:10,990
tested on on on mac and Windows but but

00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:13,880
theoretically should be Mesut be

00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:17,620
available should be able to make it

00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,970
available on linux as well what it does

00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,610
what it is basically is it's an

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,929
efficient workflow to map stuff detected

00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,120
during your own drive so it's really

00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:27,980
focused on kind of your all look

00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:33,860
processing your processing your own

00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:37,399
trips mainly at first so here you see

00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:39,679
the screen as it presents itself we

00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:42,049
start up so it's been the left basically

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,549
a list of trips with some metrics about

00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:45,649
those trips how many images are there

00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:49,549
and then on the right you'll see a map

00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:53,480
that highlights those trips as you hover

00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:56,659
over them now if you go into the trip

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,570
detail what it will show is basically a

00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:02,480
few pains of information on the bottom

00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,400
is the trip slider

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,799
so this is just basically a slider that

00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,980
can delicious it lets you navigate the

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,169
sequence of images it takes initially a

00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,530
while to load right now because it

00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:17,840
preloads all the images and then cashes

00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,640
them locally and then at the same time

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,230
it allows the detection metadata as well

00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,350
so what you see here is and the bottom

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,090
is the is the detected the detected sign

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:28,760
speed limit signs right now it's just

00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:30,320
speed limits and then on the right you

00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,350
see little map to give you some spatial

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,690
context as well and then on the left

00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,760
here is this correspond these correspond

00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,350
to all the detections here so you can

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,429
click on any of these and and the and

00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:45,530
the the the trip slider will scroll to

00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:47,450
to match the speed limit sign there and

00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:49,330
then in the background well it what

00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,650
Justin will do if you have just opened

00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:54,020
Jocelyn will automatically move to that

00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,730
location and load the way that it is

00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,549
connected that this this particular

00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,720
speed limit sign was detected 24 so this

00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:04,970
will help you going to quickly get

00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:09,369
started mapping the speed limit and in

00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:11,359
the future also other things another

00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:13,340
feature of that that we have right now

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,840
is in the background will also love the

00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,570
current speed limit as it is maps in

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,770
awesome so you can quickly see to the

00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,419
right well there's nothing selected

00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:23,419
right now button to the right you would

00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:24,980
see the the opposite view detected speed

00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:27,409
limit and then another left you would

00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,820
see the osm way the speed limit for the

00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:30,980
other same way as it is currently maps

00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,470
so if those are different then you would

00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,540
see little warning sign and and you

00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:40,159
would quickly be able to kind of act on

00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:42,260
that and modify the speed limit oh and

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:46,000
then at the top there is a series of of

00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:55,310
things that allow you to manually add a

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:58,790
speed limit detection manually add what

00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:01,040
is it blurring not yet right okay yeah

00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,660
just the speed limit so this that's what

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,570
we have right now there in the future we

00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,580
hope to do more manual adding and

00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:13,700
perhaps even removing for your own

00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:15,380
images blur blurring and detection so

00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,010
right now this is this is like I said

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,440
this is in

00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:21,940
alpha form i have a working solid

00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,250
working version on my computer so if you

00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:28,990
want to have a closer look then we can

00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:32,890
do that later so this is basically the

00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:34,780
workflow so you selected you say apply

00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,520
change and then it will go to your job

00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,820
and it will automatically create create

00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,710
that create that change for you so you

00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,750
can quickly map of course you have to be

00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,610
careful that you a speed limit is valid

00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:47,920
until there's the next speed limit sign

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:50,890
so we have to make sure there's also the

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,460
ways after that are mapped and you still

00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:55,540
have to take care of that yourself so

00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,980
now I'm going to give it over to Alex

00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:02,320
for to talk a little bit about the API

00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:07,840
okay um yeah we'll have to switch to

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:10,030
some HTML yeah it's working oh it's a

00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,750
little bit messed up but we can live

00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:16,180
with this okay this is this is actually

00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:18,910
the the API that we were using

00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:25,240
internally as well for the apps and the

00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:28,870
tools and just like as a disclosure this

00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:33,340
is like the better version of the API we

00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:35,170
kind of did this as we as we as we did

00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,360
the apps and and the website and all

00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,790
that so we know about a few

00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,430
inconsistencies here and there and we

00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:45,490
are working on improving them but we

00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:50,680
just like prefer to to make it available

00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:56,020
early and then do the 2.0 version as

00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:58,390
soon as we can okay so this is this is

00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:03,040
this is the documentation I'll quickly

00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:06,190
go through it this we have two section

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,350
of like how it works with the main the

00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,930
main things that you do with with with

00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:15,250
the API like how to display data on the

00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:19,090
map and then how to how to upload so for

00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:21,760
for displaying you can do book two

00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:23,950
things actually can display like you

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,720
have a map you can display either the

00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,480
things that we display on the website

00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,570
like the ways that are mapped

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,700
or you can display like you saw in the

00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,859
jaws unplugging like the exact points

00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,710
where where photos were taken so there

00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:45,220
are two api's for that the two methods

00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:46,869
like the tracks and nearby photos so

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:51,250
these two are just like a quick quick

00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:53,890
mention you can will will give this HTML

00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:57,010
to you guys so you can just click here

00:37:53,890 --> 00:38:00,190
and it goes to your to the exact details

00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:03,450
of the method so it's quite exhaustive

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:07,869
you can see the all the parameters there

00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:10,030
so the tracks gives you the list of ways

00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:13,320
that are are covered in a specific

00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:16,000
bounding box that you send the photos

00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,190
same thing but gives you like let longs

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,590
for each photo that was taken in in a

00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:24,130
specific bounding box then what happens

00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:29,380
is that you usually click on on the map

00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:31,300
to see to see the exact sequences that

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,700
that go through there and then you call

00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,740
the nearby tracks which for a lat long

00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:38,380
gives you all the sequences that have an

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:41,380
image at at that specific location and

00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:46,330
you can also set like radios to to

00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:51,820
search and so this is for the displaying

00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:55,330
part for the upload part so yeah as its

00:38:51,820 --> 00:39:00,430
as it as the API is called you can

00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:06,420
upload images like JPEG files geotech

00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:09,250
jpeg files or you can upload videos as

00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:12,910
we mentioned in the compression thing

00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:15,250
about the above the the apps we we

00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,470
compress the imagery that we record with

00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:20,140
the apps in a video file so it's not

00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:24,040
like 23 frames per second but it's an

00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:26,650
mp4 that will get split so you can

00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,170
upload yeah so first of all you'll have

00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:32,830
to call the api for creating a new

00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:36,640
sequence and this will return an ID that

00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:39,160
you'll use on the next api's to to tell

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,410
us on which sequence you wanna you want

00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,420
to upload

00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:45,849
then you call either the video or the

00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:50,349
photo API so if you have video files

00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:55,510
that are geotagged you use this API but

00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:57,690
like every video file is an mp4 and it

00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:01,869
has to have like a meta data file

00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:04,210
because the mp4 doesn't have those like

00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:07,569
if you know jpg JPEG has exif headers

00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:10,329
where you set the the the lat lon of the

00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:11,920
picture mp4 doesn't have that for of

00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:14,680
course for obvious reasons so we'll

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:18,180
there's a meta data file format that we

00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:23,230
document that tell us okay at this frame

00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:26,589
this you have this location the photo

00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:31,000
API is yeah so you you said like a

00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:33,760
coordinate like the GPS accuracy these

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,880
are optional actually but that alone is

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,130
the most important so this uploads a

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,549
photo at the specific index on a

00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:46,750
specific sequence so that you know what

00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:49,240
what what's what's there then when

00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:51,130
everything's done you just tell us okay

00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,440
we done we're done uploading to this

00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:56,549
sequence and then we start to do the

00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,250
processing part like the the blurring

00:40:56,549 --> 00:41:02,559
thing or optionally the video splitting

00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:07,359
where we split the videos to individual

00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:10,480
individual jpeg files so yeah this is

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:14,680
this is pretty much it about the upload

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:23,319
the upload part one thing that I'd

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:25,539
mentioned here is authentication so some

00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:27,250
of the API is mostly like the display

00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:30,430
part works without any authentication

00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:37,869
you can display everything basically but

00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:40,809
if you want to upload for example or do

00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:44,049
other things that I'll mention you need

00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:47,200
to authenticate on Open Street View you

00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:50,079
use openstreetmap authentication so you

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,390
have to have an open osm account to to

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,869
do it

00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:58,230
and basically you do the authentication

00:41:54,869 --> 00:42:01,109
on osm you send to I sound like a

00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:03,210
request token a secret token then you

00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:05,640
send those to osv and we give you an

00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:10,920
access token that you use for all the

00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:13,829
further further api's sorry if I got a

00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:19,980
little bit too technical but it's a

00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:22,109
workshop right yes all I think I'll it's

00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,809
all in here like although this is the

00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:27,510
how-to part these are broken down into

00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:30,900
for each kind of opera each type of

00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:33,750
operation you can work with but I

00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,549
mentioned this in the end of how-to for

00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:40,490
the user you can only get that like the

00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:44,010
user details yeah so I guess this is

00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:46,220
pretty much it with with the API so

00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:51,450
again this is the first time we're

00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:55,170
releasing this for now as I said it's

00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:56,869
not it's not done yet completely I think

00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:58,980
you've noticed some inconsistencies

00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:03,690
inconsistencies you if you guys know

00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:08,730
api's we're working on that we will make

00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:12,230
this available to you on demand so at

00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:12,230
this point I should probably open them

00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:21,619
how do you you need to know like dodge

00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,619
to start this okay

00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:36,089
so if you want to use the API just drop

00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:38,670
us an email at hello that at Open Street

00:43:36,089 --> 00:43:40,739
View org and tell us about your idea

00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:46,979
just a couple of lines and we'll send

00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:49,199
you this HTML file we would so the

00:43:46,979 --> 00:43:52,109
reason why we're not adding this to the

00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:55,499
website now is because we want to do the

00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:58,140
2.0 version first but if you guys want

00:43:55,499 --> 00:44:08,549
early access we can definitely provide

00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:12,239
that ok yeah so plans for the near

00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:15,420
future apart from everything that that

00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:19,170
we that we already said that had we are

00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,670
going to in front of it so rapid release

00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,109
cycles i think i mentioned that every

00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,869
two weeks we'll have new versions of the

00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:26,640
apps the website will have continued

00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:30,719
improvements as well the apps are the

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:33,029
main focus at least the user for user

00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,069
facing part the jaasmyn plugin is going

00:44:33,029 --> 00:44:38,849
to be important as well we also hope to

00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:41,699
attract some some community at least

00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:44,279
feedback at the very least but also help

00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:46,380
with that because i know there's a ton

00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:48,449
of really skilled jawsome plug-in

00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:52,650
developers in this maybe even in this

00:44:48,449 --> 00:44:56,849
crowd so we'd love your help but we

00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:59,779
continue to work on that one of the

00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:02,430
bigger things is the support for a full

00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:05,130
360-degree imagery with ever more

00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:08,940
popular 360-degree cameras like that

00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:11,640
like that Ricoh theta camera that is

00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,829
displayed there in the corner so those

00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,039
things are getting fairly cheap now not

00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:18,839
too cheap but fairly cheap and there and

00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:22,259
there of course ideal for this kind of

00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:24,769
stuff having 3d image every 360-degree

00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:27,150
imagery is going to be is going to be

00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:29,759
game-changing I think because right now

00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:32,039
right now I know people who have live

00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:36,660
camera rigs that consists of four six

00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:38,759
cameras on their cars and and and and

00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,130
creating street level imagery with that

00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:42,920
those things it's pretty cool I've tried

00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:48,380
it myself with two cameras

00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:51,530
but it gets expensive and it's also it's

00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:53,930
it's not it's not very easy to get

00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,309
started with so these things are going

00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:58,280
to get I mean right now they're still

00:45:55,309 --> 00:46:00,349
fairly crappy but because the resolution

00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,109
is just low and the sharpness of the

00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:04,730
images is not is not great so we kind of

00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:07,609
kind of it's a throwback to an earlier

00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:10,220
era of cameras in a way but they'll get

00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:12,109
better really soon I'm sure so those

00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,030
cameras are going to be very valuable to

00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:15,920
this kind of this kind of work so we

00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:19,730
want to we want to be able to support

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,069
that as soon as possible and then more

00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,839
detections like lanes different kinds of

00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:25,460
signs we're hoping for input from you

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:28,280
guys as well for this what like what

00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:31,339
what what is useful to detect and what

00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,559
is reasonable to detect so those are

00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:38,180
some of the some of the near future

00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:39,980
plans so how to get started I think by

00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:42,500
now if you probably already know how to

00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:46,520
get started apps are available for

00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:50,240
download or source go download or APK

00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:53,960
download you can sign up for a booth I

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,910
think there's still gifts actually we

00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,450
have some of those crazy little cars

00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:00,890
that you can take with you and I don't

00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,809
think camera would fit on them but

00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:06,319
they're fun to kind of drive around the

00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:08,210
living living room and then go to all

00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,309
the street you got or login you don't

00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:13,250
have to create an account you can just

00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:15,859
log in again through osm with the

00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:17,569
website through the website or through

00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:21,740
the app it doesn't really matter just

00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:24,020
have to authenticate once through osm

00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:25,730
and you're all set so that's that simple

00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:28,130
and just start driving or biking or

00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:29,299
walking around for that matter it

00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,829
doesn't really matter like obviously

00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:33,260
view is pretty much it's one thing I

00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:35,240
perhaps we didn't mention is local we

00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,160
we're building this very much with kind

00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,640
of driving in mind but it doesn't really

00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:43,099
preclude any other use cases if you want

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,930
to bike or if you want to walk you can

00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:46,520
you can manually manually force and

00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:48,950
taking an image by tapping on the screen

00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,140
so it's it's really you can use it for

00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:54,619
for whatever purpose you want to use it

00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,680
for we are kind of focused because we're

00:47:54,619 --> 00:48:00,280
navigation company so we're kind of

00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:03,940
always we always were always thinking

00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,440
about cars but having lived in Amsterdam

00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:09,849
for 20 years I know that's not all there

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:12,819
is so use it for whatever you want

00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:14,500
really it's my message I think this is a

00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:16,300
pretty much the last slide which leaves

00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:18,040
us a nice little nice little chunk of

00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:21,069
time for more questions and discussion

00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,960
yeah we have like 10 minutes there's a

00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:29,380
good there's a good chunk of questions

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:32,130
here so can you go around with a mic on

00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,130
again thanks for

00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:52,610
you already mentioned that you're very

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,570
car focused with are you considering to

00:48:52,610 --> 00:49:01,370
add like bike modus or walk motors where

00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:06,070
it will snap to bike paths or sidewalks

00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:09,440
instead of man normal road alright so

00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:12,290
there are like multiple angles one is

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:16,160
matching so that you match on proper

00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:18,860
proper roads proper ways and then

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,520
there's also the interval where you take

00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:25,460
photos right so you have to do this both

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,380
things we're currently working on the on

00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:30,940
the matching part to have proper

00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:35,920
matching for four bike paths and

00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:39,820
pedestrian paths and we're for the

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:44,030
ladder it's not that difficult so we

00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:48,080
will do that I think even shortly to

00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:50,930
have like the other modes but again you

00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:54,470
can do that today like with a bike wear

00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:57,110
or walking it's just a matter of like

00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:59,180
the interval where it takes photos is

00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:01,280
not entirely focused on cars so if

00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:03,890
you're walking slowly it will take a

00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:07,100
photo every like five meters that's also

00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:09,530
in the car so it's it's okay for biking

00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:11,420
and pedestrian but we'll have to

00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:16,010
propagate this nicely into the user

00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:18,350
interface I agree is there anything for

00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:20,180
indicating a point of interest and might

00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:24,410
be recording a snatch of audio so you

00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:25,730
can say you've seen something like for

00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:29,080
example one of the things i want to

00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:31,550
start getting is gas pipeline markers

00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:34,490
where you see a white and red post

00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:36,920
beside the road there's lots of those in

00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,900
my area so i'd like to be able to say

00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:43,000
i've seen one so i can go back to that

00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,000
quickly on the track

00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:50,059
I think it's I think what I don't think

00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:51,829
we have considered audio notes yet no

00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:52,910
it's Alan but I think it's an

00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:55,609
interesting I think it's an interesting

00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:59,150
idea and I'm going to take that with us

00:50:55,609 --> 00:51:01,609
to consider it's not something that's on

00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:05,059
our radar yet but I do think it's an

00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:08,329
interesting suggestion that would kind

00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:12,799
of enhance the usability for for some

00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:17,809
things so yeah I like the idea huh

00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:20,900
thanks i will be a fully automated

00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:23,630
workflow in the future because i noticed

00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,970
it myself I don't have a lot of time to

00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:29,420
do a manual upload i use my pillory a

00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:31,579
lot and it takes a lot of photos also a

00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:36,740
lots of them not usable but some of them

00:51:31,579 --> 00:51:40,670
are like max speed species I'm a maximum

00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:42,589
speed signs that's long well they can

00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,059
defer for something like 500 meter six

00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:46,759
on the meters and I would like to have

00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:51,099
sort of full of my the workflow that the

00:51:46,759 --> 00:51:51,099
app automatically updates openstreetmap

00:51:52,269 --> 00:52:00,079
so the vision is definitely to to go to

00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:04,910
that path to automatize what we can do

00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:07,539
right we're in a state where like we

00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:10,250
started this the vision is to get there

00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:13,730
what we just take it step by step so

00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:18,980
first step is just detect with with a

00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:23,240
certain amount of was the word like

00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:25,039
confidence and after a certain level of

00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:29,299
confidence we display that in the UI for

00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:31,609
the human to to review but if like we

00:52:29,299 --> 00:52:34,369
will get more data and will train the

00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:38,960
algorithms to do better and then we can

00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:40,720
go to like an automatic workflow in the

00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:46,339
future so that's that's the vision it's

00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:47,720
it just made the first step let me add

00:52:46,339 --> 00:52:52,880
something to that real quick I think

00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:54,950
yeah so as much as we would like to go

00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,450
fully automatic I think there's also

00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:58,369
there's all those has to be a human

00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:01,049
component to it

00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:06,720
at least for the foreseeable future I

00:53:01,049 --> 00:53:09,329
don't like as not as much as we can

00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:13,079
train these these these machines to do

00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:15,240
stuff for us I do think it will remain a

00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:17,519
challenging to kind of fully fully

00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,440
automate it also because mapping and

00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:22,019
awesome is not an it's not always an

00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,109
exact science so often it is but not

00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:27,450
always this in I guess what I'm saying

00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:28,769
this is so many in the in the in the in

00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:31,890
the mapping that I've done based on the

00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:34,109
open Street View I've seen so many

00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:36,390
things where it didn't quite match up

00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:37,890
didn't quite match up to reality and I

00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:41,309
hear that a lot from the folks who map

00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:43,920
in our in within within TeleNav as well

00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:47,519
that are using this stuff that there's

00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,319
just a lot of exceptions where where

00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,269
yeah weather where the map matching

00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:53,819
doesn't quite work out where the where

00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:56,309
the speed limit is well there's a lot of

00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:58,440
for example like a temporary like

00:53:56,309 --> 00:54:01,260
temporary restrictions on speeds there's

00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:04,230
speed limits that there are that are

00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:08,460
attached to school zones or whatever so

00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:10,079
there's just a lot of there's just a lot

00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,549
of real life that comes into play is

00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,140
what I'm saying and I think there's

00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:15,569
always going to be some kind of human

00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:17,819
component to resolving that but we can

00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:19,380
get pretty far with automation and

00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:20,819
that's kind of that the what the I think

00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,369
that's what the map editor is showing

00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:26,190
that we can we can do like eighty to

00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:28,920
ninety percent of the work for you is

00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:31,130
that does it sound that we're good

00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,130
enough

00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,270
sometimes

00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:21,250
agree two questions one car technology

00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:26,750
what about map matching okay does work

00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:31,040
one of the obd2 plugs do you know if I

00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:33,740
can put two of them into my car okay so

00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:36,650
it's one car one there's re only one

00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:39,170
plug in the car unfortunately yeah my

00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:40,910
car is to actually I found another one

00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:43,310
in my car after some searching so you

00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:46,970
might you might get lucky why would you

00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:50,390
wanna have to I have one application I'm

00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:54,230
a beta tester for tank taller in Germany

00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:58,010
and on the other hand I would try to use

00:55:54,230 --> 00:56:01,190
yours anyway the other question for me

00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:03,800
much more important what do you with map

00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:05,900
matching in very sparsely mapped areas

00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:11,000
like for example when I go to vacation

00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:15,260
to Tok I was it the places I grew up in

00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:18,170
and yes nearly zero roads there I could

00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:20,600
take pictures but you could not you

00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:24,620
would not be able to map match until

00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:27,080
weeks later maybe right so I have two

00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:30,620
answers what the specs say and what it's

00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,830
implemented actually so the specs say

00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:36,470
that if you're if you're out of mapped

00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:38,720
like a mapped road we'll just keep all

00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:40,640
the raw positions so that you can go

00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,980
through them exactly as they come from

00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:46,880
the GPS so that's also like a good tool

00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:48,940
to add roads I'd say it's not fully

00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:54,470
there so we have a few bugs there but

00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:56,930
we're hoping to fix those but yeah like

00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:59,300
the the answer is how it will work is

00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:00,890
that you'll have just like the raw GPS

00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:04,520
positions and if you have multiple

00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:06,830
passes it would look like the the red

00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:12,350
polylines that i showed in that slide

00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:15,290
where you don't have any matching thank

00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:18,860
you is it somehow envisage

00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:23,000
any usage of open Street video during

00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:26,150
emergencies so for example for in

00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,390
supporting damage grading damage

00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:31,700
analysis from remote sensing or for

00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:34,670
validate analysis that has been

00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:38,420
performed through satellite imagery I

00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:40,850
think specifically in regard with the

00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:42,650
previous comment that could be as full

00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:44,920
in that case to a but they have the

00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:48,500
possibility to add the p.o eyes or the

00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:51,650
detection of some features during the

00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:55,070
acquisition and also possibly having

00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:57,880
some editors that is dedicated to detect

00:57:55,070 --> 00:58:05,830
this kind of situation may may be

00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:10,070
visualizing a pre and post image right I

00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:11,720
guess so as far as the O's fit platform

00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:14,660
itself is concerned I think there's

00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:16,100
nothing that stands in its way to to to

00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:19,610
use it for that purpose but if you go

00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:21,590
into very specific needs in terms of

00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:24,230
specific detections that are maybe not

00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:25,550
useful for the general public I think

00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:29,180
that's where the open source part of it

00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:33,200
comes into play if it doesn't do what

00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:35,000
you wanted to do you you can make it

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,800
want to do it you what you do I mean

00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,010
that can be very unsatisfactory answer

00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:42,350
because that requires work but like we

00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:44,690
try and we try and supply a platform

00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:51,200
that works for like the general use case

00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:54,020
of open street map mapping of like the

00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,810
the features that features that if you

00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:59,660
are very useful to a lot of people using

00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:02,090
OpenStreetMap data if you get into more

00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:05,120
specific use cases then I think the

00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:07,250
platform can can be made to support

00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:11,510
those that won't do it out of the box

00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:14,780
but they it being open would allow you

00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:17,360
to kind of build your own there's

00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:21,620
nothing that's would stand in sand in

00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:23,900
that way for specifically and so yeah i

00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:25,700
would i would really i would really like

00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,230
to see obviously if you evolved into

00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,460
something like that where it gets where

00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,650
it gets all these kind of

00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:33,080
niches that are that are where it's used

00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:34,790
in for things that kind of we have even

00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,520
imagined we're trying to build something

00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:41,030
generic that is a very useful base and

00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,710
then hoping that people use it for all

00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:46,130
kinds of things so I think your your

00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:50,830
your idea is as good one is any and I

00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:50,830
would love to see that happen so yeah

00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,790
what's our questions

00:59:58,349 --> 01:00:05,109
this unit I take the same road to work

01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:07,869
and back every day and I upload a stream

01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:09,880
everyday as well how do you process and

01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:11,740
combine all these data to keep it as

01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:15,730
separate streams or do you merge it

01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:18,279
together somehow in terms of like

01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:20,049
visuals on the website or on the app's

01:00:18,279 --> 01:00:23,200
you'll see just one line because we

01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:26,349
aggregate all the I mean there's a

01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:29,950
street includes where are 250 passes

01:00:26,349 --> 01:00:31,750
right right so on the visually you'll

01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:34,299
see just one line but when you click on

01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:37,359
it you'll see all these separate

01:00:34,299 --> 01:00:40,750
sequences so at a logic level they're

01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:44,440
separate so it is just like one sequence

01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:49,329
each time in the database in like the

01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:57,910
files file system we just have time for

01:00:49,329 --> 01:01:00,940
one more question yeah you mentioned 360

01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:03,490
cameras but do you also support

01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:06,369
traditional sequentially taken panoramas

01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:08,619
and build a direction encoding be

01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:12,579
correct on them if i only turn the

01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:14,859
camera and don't move right so this will

01:01:12,579 --> 01:01:17,440
come into place where we when we add

01:01:14,859 --> 01:01:20,490
support for this 360 so it's kind of

01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:23,410
like a subset of that right having

01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:26,680
panoramas so now we're we implement we

01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:28,720
will start working on them like the

01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:32,819
general visualization thing where you

01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:35,319
pan around the the image and you can go

01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:37,630
all the way so once we have that

01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:40,779
panoramas will fall into the same like

01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:45,430
workflow so will will support those when

01:01:40,779 --> 01:01:50,309
we support the 360 basically okay thanks

01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:50,309
Alex and not paying for this nice torch

01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,210
