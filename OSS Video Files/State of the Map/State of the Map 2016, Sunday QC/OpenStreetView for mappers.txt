OpenStreetView is the free and open street level imagery platform designed 100% with OSM mappers in mind. In this workshop, we will walk you through all the components of OSV: the open source mobile apps, the OSV editor, JOSM plugins, and web site. We hope to also be able to show you an early version of iD integration. Once we get that out of the way, we will look at some tips and tricks specific to mapping with OSV, and there will be lots of time to answer all your questions around the OSV platform. Bring your laptop and smartphones!
