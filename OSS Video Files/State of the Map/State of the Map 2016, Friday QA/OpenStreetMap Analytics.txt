Description: 
	Cristiano Giovando at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/openstreetmap-analytics/

With a global community of over 2.5 million registered users and a planet reaching the 50GB file size, making sense of OSM data, globally, locally, and temporally, presents significant challenges. In 2016 an online platform which could filter by user, timeslider, custom drawn areas and more was born.

Built by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, with support by key partners, the application relies on daily preprocessing routines of OSM QA Tiles and data aggregation into vector tiles. By making OSM data facts easily accessible through an intuitive user interface, OSM-Analytics.org wants to become the go-to place for tracking progress on community mapping projects, assessing map coverage, and telling data-rich map stories. Cristiano explains all.

all sit down please I have the pleasure

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,389
to introduce Cristiano giovan dough from

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,820
humanitarian OpenStreetMap and he will

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:22,039
be talking about openstreetmap analytics

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:22,039
thank you good morning everyone

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:32,969
buongiorno bonjou um yeah we're talking

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:36,450
about analytics or what's what's the

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,160
stats for open stream event this morning

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,290
I was putting together this map which

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,629
were just trying to point out where I'm

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,360
from where I'm base and realized we

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:51,000
don't really have a map of mappers do we

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,360
so maybe a hack for for Monday put

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,850
together at least a map of who's here

00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:02,760
today the the conference anyway so I

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,549
started working with hot humanitarian

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,159
OpenStreetMap last year on a project

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,000
around imagery imagery is very important

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,150
to ha osm and the project that I worked

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,229
on is open area map if you want to learn

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,150
more about how sm I'm assuming many of

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,180
you probably know about humanitarian

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,140
OpenStreetMap but just to give you a

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,030
quick overview and why it's important

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:34,110
and why analytics are important for a

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,530
hot osm I just wanted to give you a

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,630
quick overview of what we do we do

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,840
Disaster Response mapping we do

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,840
humanitarian map in and we train people

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,530
on the ground to work with osm and

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,000
create free public maps the main tool

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,970
that we use is called the task manager

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,450
where we select an area of interests and

00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,299
we split it up and we coordinate mappers

00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:02,219
around a mechanical turk type of tool

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,880
where we we split the task in each

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:09,300
volunteer maps piece and then at the end

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,489
we have a complete map the other thing

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,680
that we do as I mentioned we work on the

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,890
ground collecting information that kind

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,330
of

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,400
be extracted from imagery and so we

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,240
train people to do that and we also

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,140
train the trainers who will become the

00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,290
local leaders in OpenStreetMap

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,350
communities if you want to learn more

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,480
about how osm tomorrow nine thirty or

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,390
director Tyler will be given a talk

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,160
around what we do and so on you can

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:46,280
attend that and learn about it the other

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:49,560
half of my day job is with the GF grr a

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,709
group at the World Bank where we work on

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,070
several projects around the world again

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,840
using openstreetmap tools working with

00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:04,650
government to start open data programs

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:07,860
and many times both with ha and in an

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,980
Jeff grr with the wind er I we are asked

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,590
questions about what is the completeness

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,850
of the map is the map good is the data

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,440
that we you're mapping the we're mapping

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,840
covering the entire area that we that we

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,930
need the map for are there any gaps

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,120
because maybe there is a there are

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,780
clouds and imaging when the the map was

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,760
originally created by tracing imagery so

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:40,430
we started thinking and come up with

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:43,019
with questions and last year ha also the

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,900
decided to join the efforts around the

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,299
sustainable development goals and help

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,100
communities to map in an effort to

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,530
achieve some of these sustainable

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,269
development goals and again more

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,810
question came up how can we measure the

00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:02,989
impact of our work how can we measure if

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:06,390
we really achieve these goals and so the

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:08,880
there are tools around the community

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,190
which are already extracting this

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,739
metadata information about the

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,130
OpenStreetMap database here are some

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:20,250
like the missing math leaderboards the

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,890
same changed set and tag info these are

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,930
really great tools awesome tools that

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,490
really give you insights and what's

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:31,080
happening behind the map or

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,690
what are the numbers behind the map but

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:39,729
we wanted to visualize some of this

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:42,069
information on a map and so we started

00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:45,759
thinking the nice thing of working with

00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:49,150
osm and ha is really that you can get

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,819
online and immediately start talking to

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:55,720
people in all different time zones and

00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:58,660
so we had some some discussion last year

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,789
came up with ideas of what we wanted to

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,210
do and then we found an opportunity to

00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:06,069
create a prototype of what we had been

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:10,270
thinking to give some answers to these

00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:13,419
questions so we apply for a small knight

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:16,000
Foundation product I fun and we were

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:19,120
awarded and so earlier this year we

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,210
start a development and again in the

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,819
spirit of most of the work that we do I

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,889
mean all of the work that we do ha all

00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:29,530
of the tools that we build they're all

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:34,780
open source communication is open true

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:40,419
open chest like IRC getter and so we

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:45,099
started building the tool thanks to a

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:48,159
very smart developer the my be in this

00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:52,360
room Martin are you here there's Martin

00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:56,680
right there in less than a month the the

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,080
ideas that we had became reality we came

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,520
together we started thinking around the

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,599
design we wanted to make something

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,810
really really easy to use so that

00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:10,509
government officials responders and

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:13,000
journalists can really go to a place and

00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:16,360
simply see what is the coverage of the

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:22,530
data are there any gaps was the map up

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:25,479
data recently or was it demamp old so in

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:30,759
just one month as i said from march to

00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:33,250
april 2016 we built it and this is what

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,560
it looks like now i'm going to go

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,849
through some of the functionalities that

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,420
we they rebuilt in so the main and the

00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,220
first

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,590
into you you'll see when you go to

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,020
seminole it expand I encourage you not

00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:50,430
to go right now because the connection

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:54,100
is it's pretty overwhelmed at the moment

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:57,790
take turns but as you can see you can

00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:01,450
start from the entire world and zoom

00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:07,330
into street level to building level in

00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:09,550
this case and see exactly the density

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:18,250
and then the individual building over a

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:20,500
spatial map but also over time so if you

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,530
look at the bottom you can see that

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,560
there's a graph that shows for example

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:30,070
in this case is the entire world and it

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,330
shows the density of buildings and you

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:36,250
can quickly get a number total summary

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,890
of how many buildings we have we're

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:42,760
pretty close to two million to 200

00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:45,430
million buildings and you can see over

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,160
time what is the distribution or or I

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:51,580
guess the the last time each building

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:55,090
has been edited this is pretty useful

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,290
because it tells you for example there

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,210
are a lot of buildings in Europe

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:02,350
probably there's no more buildings to be

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:05,980
map in Germany right but there's so many

00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:09,640
places that you know and there now so

00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:12,820
map as in others and you can look at

00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:15,910
this both globally locally as I say you

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,460
can zoom in by by region you can define

00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,530
your own region and really start to get

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:28,560
some insights and the distribution of

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:36,160
data you can also look at the time map

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:41,170
as a way to detect specific events this

00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:43,660
is Nepal and that is 2015 when ha

00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:46,810
activated for the response to the

00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:49,980
earthquakes in in April and you can see

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:53,600
it you can see it under on the map and

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:57,500
you can see it

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,750
scale of the time they're the bottom and

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:04,670
are interesting things that you can

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:08,889
start to look into a time scale and an

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:11,630
visual representation on the map or the

00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:14,029
effect of some of the mapping campaigns

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,339
that we do with hot where this is our

00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:18,319
solemn and there's been an incredible

00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:23,360
effort by the local community and some

00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:26,300
of the hot team people there to map all

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,690
of dar Salam over the past three four

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:33,050
five years and you can see some of the

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,670
campaigns by highlighting yeah I didn't

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:40,190
mention it but you can actually select

00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:43,430
within the within the the time slider as

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,690
well as in the map the the pier that

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,639
you're interested in and he will

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,769
automatically highlight on the map in

00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:51,319
blue what you're looking at so in this

00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:54,350
case we're looking at some times in

00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:56,990
September 2015 where there was a

00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:03,139
campaign dedicated to mount a specific

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:05,899
word there other interesting things that

00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:08,240
you can see by highlighting maps I

00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:10,550
highlighting features on the on the time

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:16,009
slider in this case we're going back to

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:19,550
2010 when the OpenStreetMap community

00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:22,100
responded to the haiti eric way and you

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:26,449
can see by selecting the specific days

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:28,819
right after the earthquake and look at

00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:31,759
roads in this case that haven't been

00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:35,600
touched they haven't been edited since

00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:38,630
then this is pretty useful to answer

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,480
some questions around quality or

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,459
potential quality of that information

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:48,589
that information hasn't hasn't changed

00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:52,130
since 2010 could be feet could be fed

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:54,230
into other tools to to check on the

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,990
accuracy of those specific features that

00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:02,870
haven't been touched in in the number

00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:05,480
six years another feature that we built

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,750
into this tool are some quick statistics

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,360
on quick num

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:13,020
as I mentioned before we're close to 200

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:17,190
million buildings in the world and we

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:20,340
are close to 124 trips to the moon of

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,290
roads mapped in OpenStreetMap that's

00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,780
quite a lot I don't know how much in

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:30,510
miles or kilometers but you can click on

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:33,150
that arrow and it will show you you can

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:38,610
also zoom in to street level as I said

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:41,520
and you can look at plaques like some of

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,880
the organiser probably hear the the

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,670
event in the past couple months made

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,640
some some quick fixes due to the

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:53,160
buildings within the university these

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,380
are all facts that you can infer from

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,860
just looking at the metadata just

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:02,610
looking at the information and in the in

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:06,240
the database another feature that we

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:09,390
wanted to include that was useful to us

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,970
to understand to understand some of the

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:14,520
quality of the map what is the level of

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,640
experience represented in some of the

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,770
features that are being math so in this

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,640
case if you switch to another tool

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:26,220
within the interface you can you can

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,020
look at the level of experience each of

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,160
the features are highlighted in this

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:34,710
case our features have been created by

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:39,180
beginner mappers and so we're in London

00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:42,810
Hyde Park for some reason the trails in

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:45,030
Hyde Park have been mapped by new

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,910
mappers but that can give you some good

00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,520
insights when you do quick response

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:53,730
activation you have new mappers and you

00:12:50,520 --> 00:13:00,000
want to maybe validate some of the words

00:12:53,730 --> 00:13:03,600
done by some of these new mappers and of

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,720
course we wanted to include the before

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:12,390
and after feature this is always very

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,610
useful to show the work that was done by

00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:17,760
the same community in this case we're

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:20,310
looking at the earthquake in Italy last

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,770
month and you can really see how

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:27,450
these areas that were not on the map

00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:30,510
which I'm surprised in just a few days

00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:35,040
were completely mapped by the by the

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:38,970
Italian community in here again we're

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:43,640
looking at the before and after for for

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:48,000
the University here in we can see how in

00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,160
2011 the campus was pretty much all done

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,110
but after that there have been more

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,190
additions of all the buildings for for

00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:58,920
the rest of the of the city how does it

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,589
work Martin if you want to learn more

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,750
you can catch up with Martin or meet us

00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:06,540
on sunday we're going to have a BF on

00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:10,290
osm analytics but this is pretty much

00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:13,320
the stack that we use in the background

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:17,220
and in the back end and we have these

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,560
routines run in every every day so that

00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,980
the data is updated constantly every day

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:25,230
it's pushed into some vector towels a

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,970
way to store data efficiently and then

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:31,980
the information is put on the map

00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:34,320
through a JavaScript interface we have a

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,480
lot of ideas a lot of question that we

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,780
still want to answer i'm sure everyone

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,910
here wants to understand more of the

00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,870
data in OpenStreetMap we have seen some

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:49,500
really interesting were done by some of

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:53,750
our colleagues there's some machine

00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:57,810
learning algorithms that can now detect

00:14:53,750 --> 00:15:00,060
buildings or areas of populated areas

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:03,120
there's already population data said

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:08,459
that for example could be used to create

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:11,550
an index of the population distribution

00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:14,220
and use that as a reference for example

00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,740
to understand if the buildings that we

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:20,100
map really represent the distribution of

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,529
population that way we can start to

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,350
think whether there might be some gaps

00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,820
in the map because of the what the

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,120
machine detected and what has been

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,550
mapped into open stream of

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:37,160
other interesting work has been done

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:40,160
around user contributions this set of

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,110
analysis done using pretty much the same

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,350
stack the same type of approach every

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,420
user no seminal it extend I Jennings

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,720
over the summer and we are planning to

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:54,410
integrate some of these new features

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:56,089
into or seminar latex but again anyone

00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,010
here I talked to people already

00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:00,710
yesterday we were at the hot summoned

00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:03,620
humanitarian OpenStreetMap summit we we

00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:07,580
talked about ideas so please go to our

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:10,010
to the to the repo website look at it

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:13,370
and join us on sunday we're going to

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:15,160
have a bof and we really want to get

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,540
your ideas on what's going to be next

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,300
integrate some of your research work and

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:23,690
really we built this as a platform for

00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:28,220
anyone to use for anyone to replicate to

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:34,670
fork and in and give us daily insights

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:38,260
into geo sm map and finally i just wanna

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:41,420
thank you because this really shows

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:44,180
through doing this work I've been in

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,790
open stream up for over 10 years now I

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,610
always been telling everyone about it

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:53,690
advocating for it but true this tool I

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,779
really can show to people how good and

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,740
awesome the mappers in the community is

00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:59,740
so thank you

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:13,600
do I take questions now or okay if

00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:22,060
there's anyone with questions I can go

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:24,490
with first person hello thank you for

00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,130
very much for your tone I am a genre

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:31,180
working for a French local government a

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:36,960
community of cities and my big dream in

00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:42,490
your tool is that if we could also see

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:46,840
rivers ditch and all this because more

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:50,920
and more we will have challenges to

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:54,970
fight fruits and it is I think really

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:59,500
important to know how the roads are done

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:03,640
next to reverse a ditch and if we have

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:07,690
to prevent disasters mostly when the lot

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:11,970
of water doors are impacted and your

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:16,960
tool is really important to be used to

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:20,410
next time attics you see what I mean

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,460
yeah i perfectly agree there's been

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:26,110
discussions about integrating more

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:30,010
elements of the map so rivers in this

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:32,080
case or and it just a matter of time we

00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,730
started working on it as a prototype but

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,960
the workflow would be exactly the same

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:40,450
so I welcome your idea and now I'll put

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,290
on top of the list for the next features

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,680
of that we're going to include more

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,680
questions

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,980
yeah this is really interesting i'm i'm

00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:59,720
wondering have you thought about how to

00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:03,860
determine if certain tags are complete

00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,240
in regions how do you how do you decide

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,280
if you've got all the schools or you've

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,980
got all the parks we've got all the gas

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,100
stations for instance in Turkmenistan

00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:16,700
yeah that's a good question and actually

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,500
wanted the recent ideas which you can

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,700
see here at the bottom is really to

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:25,880
understand more about the weather the

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,100
map is organic it's billed by local

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,130
mappers underground versus being trays

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,590
so for example in this case we're

00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,750
suggesting to include features that

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,670
would you know indicate that the map has

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,470
been mapped on the ground like street

00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:43,190
names where you can only see it if

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:54,590
you're there but yeah to answer your

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:59,330
your your question we sorry yeah to

00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:06,010
answer your question we have sorry I

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:06,010
don't remember your questions oh yeah

00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:16,100
yeah the the way that the current worker

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,620
works is to pass the input data from QA

00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,300
tiles into a function so anything you

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:24,020
can build into that function that then

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:26,600
spits out individual tiles by a certain

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,400
you know analysis that you want to do if

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,280
you can convert that question into an

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,400
analysis if its spatial for example

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,090
there's this awesome turf library that

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,800
you can you know for example calculate

00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:42,440
spatial relationship with in specific

00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:46,790
areas so if we want to look at a

00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,710
completeness of tags again we we can

00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:52,760
include that information from from the

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:55,220
database and just convert it into a

00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,160
function which I'm not an expert about

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,029
but Martino and others may give you some

00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,919
insights

00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:04,200
you have to have a number you had to

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:08,700
have a number to compare against put

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:14,129
into your system if you want to write

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:17,279
the function please thank you thank you

00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:21,029
Christian oh so I see here that they've

00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,139
added demos and documentation and I kind

00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,719
of have a feature request which I

00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:25,919
promised a lot in github comes from a

00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:28,590
research working group that we had

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,419
yesterday in that somebody said I want

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,059
to understand I know it's a powerful

00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,519
data set but I understand it and he said

00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:37,619
I do research on extractive mining and

00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,739
so what I and he said you know what I'd

00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,719
be interested in is a front page that

00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:44,190
had narratives like here's what

00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,570
government needs here's a here's a

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,059
business example here's the civil

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,279
society example so just even like four

00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:52,589
or five use cases on one of the tabs

00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,049
might be useful to help people surface

00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:57,179
because knowing where all the mines are

00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,639
in West Africa knowing that you can use

00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,799
osm for that that might help that small

00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:03,989
NGO or that researcher now we know that

00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,940
is OS end users and has this community

00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,399
but some but someone who's trying to

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,710
understand how to use it oh is this this

00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:13,409
tool activates it in a way that baking

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:16,200
soda activates cake thank you yeah

00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:19,409
thanks center I think it surround the

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,049
the fort the top priority out there

00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:28,109
where we really wanted to build examples

00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:31,159
around thematic ideas so let's do it any

00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:31,159
other question

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:42,240
so a awesome job right it really really

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,530
impressive so yesterday during the hot

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,870
summit Heather had mentioned kind of

00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,910
maybe a tool for sort of mentoring or

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,190
pairing people up have you looked at

00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:52,320
kind of being able to run analytics

00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,670
against individual users where you say

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,350
hey this person is always making

00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,910
mistakes when it comes to the correct

00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,710
relationships of turning lanes and that

00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,180
sort of stuff and then maybe using that

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,550
to say hey you know would you like

00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,190
counseling or help or we will partner

00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:10,470
you up with that I mean this this looks

00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:13,470
like would fit that bill I think that

00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:16,260
would be really useful to to help with

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,590
I'm bored in with quality checks so

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,230
definitely something that this workflow

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,300
especially for the the back end

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:26,280
crunching could definitely help I don't

00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,740
know if we want to display that on a map

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:32,040
necessarily maybe this would just feed

00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,930
into a system that alerts or sends a

00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,560
message to some of the experience mapper

00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:40,740
saying hey look someone would need your

00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:43,230
help can you help but yeah potentially

00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,600
all of that could also be visualized the

00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:49,080
same way that some of the Paschal's

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,920
tools show the footprint of where you

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:56,010
worked similarly the same way that we

00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:58,170
show like the level of experience by

00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:05,130
using the information we can put it on

00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:07,800
the map yeah hi Cristiano just one short

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:11,520
question if you want to like a forking

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,200
or like mirror the this awesome

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,480
analytics into our own server is there

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,550
any like Rick surfer requirements that

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,170
is so that at least our server wouldn't

00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:26,070
crash been running this in terms of

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:30,960
back-end processing power yes right now

00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:34,620
it's a fairly medium machine Martin can

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,620
confirm hosted in the cloud it was just

00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:40,290
quick and efficient for us to use a

00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,540
machine that works overnight for a few

00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:45,780
hours tranches the data and then turns

00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,590
off ideal if we start to put more

00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,110
information

00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:52,110
more layers we want to be able to PI

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:55,140
lies that process and this could

00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:58,020
potentially be updated even every hour

00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,850
so it's just a matter of how much can

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,179
you scale if you have a cloud

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,350
infrastructure but on a medium

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:06,270
workstation which I think compares to

00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:08,640
the one we're using they should do it

00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,710
easily every every day at least for the

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,630
type of data that we use which is

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:16,429
probably the biggest buildings and roads

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:18,390
compared to other features in the map

00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:21,600
thing we've got time for one more

00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:26,159
question always start changing laptops

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:31,380
if there is one more question right

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:33,390
thank you i'll post a gentle hand to

00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:40,309
introduce our next speakers all right

00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:40,309
