The ImproveOsm plugin is a powerful tool, giving the JOSM mapper access to a huge amount of missing data points in OSM based on Big Data analysis. In this lightning talk the plugin’s main developer Beata will show you how to use it effectively in your daily mapping. If you would like to know more about the way we analyze billions of GPS points to identify the missing roads, one-ways and turn restrictions, you should also go to our talk ‘Using Big Data To Help Us Improve The Map’.
