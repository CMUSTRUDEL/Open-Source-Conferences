welcome that was confusing I wasn't that

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:15,179
loud before ah the usual technical

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,910
problems but people are here we have a

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,130
projector we'd probably have some slides

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:26,010
with some maps later I'm Gregory and I'm

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:28,039
going to phone my slides are so welcome

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,090
everyone to grand street map and

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,940
somewhere I've got some notes as well

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,649
look how smooth this is welcome it's

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,930
good i'm just looking around are there

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:43,489
some familiar faces some faces in before

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:49,200
that's because we've got 52 countries

00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:51,570
represented here which is a may eighteen

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,600
percent of which were from belgium so

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,149
it's great to be taking state of the map

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,390
to different countries and gain local

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,190
people involved and we've had mumps and

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,700
months of planning so i hope you enjoy

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,180
it hello also to the live feed which I

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,010
believe are now streaming yep so twitter

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,380
is probably telling me if that's correct

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:18,600
or not whether people who gave up

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:22,439
through cool so um there's the usual

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,390
things to go through if there's a farah

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,520
loud alarm will go off we're not

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:32,659
expecting a test and and there are signs

00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:36,869
the green lit up average above the doors

00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:40,799
follow those and go out and we'll make

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:44,780
sure you're safe we've got volunteers in

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,329

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:51,780
so with objects I like the logo today

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,939
like the Belgian waffle and if you have

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,640
any questions or need any help or would

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,579
like some assistant look for someone in

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,409
a t-shirt like this there's also the

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,439
help desk where you registered

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:08,340

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:12,060
help you there we go code of conduct for

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,810

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,890
birds of a feather I've heard people

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,780
asking this about this already because

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,900
they've been street map is so massive

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:40,530
and my friends were aren't matters no

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,930
it's kind of a geeky thing and a kind of

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,569
small community you just have that much

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,609
but actually its massive look at you all

00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,590
that we got it and there's subgroups

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:52,680
within that you know you've got people

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:57,120
interested in humanitarian stuff people

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,280
that are programming and and working on

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,829
a specific tool like Jotham you got

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,230
people that like mapping schools or

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,670
parks and all these different groups so

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,329

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:11,160
feather who flock together and you may

00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:14,100

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,180
they've all got this box about a

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,710

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,099
well if you're if you're not so

00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,510

tea break they're all quite friendly

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:13,330
because it's community conference so

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,419
there we go and talking and lee we got

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,370
events later so on saturday evening

00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,500
we're going to this place which is an

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,780
old brewery which is what's got the

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,229
round space for the tanks there's going

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,270
to be food and drinks for you there but

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:29,919
going to be doors open at seven p.m. on

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,010
saturday which is slightly different

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,740
than the program will remind you about

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:39,250
that tomorrow that 7pm then

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,840
and food being served at seven thirty

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,180
later on there's a half day that's on

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,980
Monday she want to go to the hack day

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,900
and kind of help with some of the

00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,460
projects that's either programming or

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,200
think that some might have some

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:57,200
documentation roles or just ideas you

00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,590
need to register so go to map timber dot

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,980
Brussels that's a web address for the

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,600
month of Matt timber and register there

00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,440
so they know the numbers you need to be

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:13,310
registered to be able to go to that and

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:15,650
then we got our sponsors which a it

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,530
really makes it possible it makes it

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:22,250
possible for us to have this venue and

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,770
all the logistics and things and and

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,980
everything particular map box our gold

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:30,080
sponsor obviously I think all these

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:33,350
people realize that state of the map

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,330
there's something worthwhile in it so

00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:39,980
it's a yeah that they rely Saints

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,860
worthwhile in there I would say if you

00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,200
find these sponsors I think some of them

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,480
have boost downstairs then awesome what

00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,760
why there they care about state of the

00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,860
map I don't know exactly what their

00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,560
answer will be it might depend on the

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,860
the person let alone the company but it

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:02,230
might be some interesting answers there

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:05,450
and then I think have got Martin here

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,760
from the OpenStreetMap foundation and

00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:12,820
he's going to be talking about something

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,820
