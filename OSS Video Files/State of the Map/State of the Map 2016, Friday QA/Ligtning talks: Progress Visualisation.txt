http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/progress-vis/

In this lightning talk I will explain how I make progress videos for all sorts of mapping parties. From local London ones, to HOT activation events and even country wide changes. I cover data acquisition, processing, and rendering into a video with ffmpeg.

well i'll be talking very quickly about

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,440
visualizing progress and that is in the

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,570
form of doing mapping I'm Derek I'm

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,700
British Dutch I don't do anything

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,500
work-wise with maps but it's sort of my

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:19,289
hobby I so let me get started so what

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,960
does this talk about it's about a way of

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,640
showing when people are mapping how the

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,890
progress actually is and it can be very

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,990
simple things for local mapping parties

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,000
that we've done in London or h.o.t

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,149
events or even for whole country's first

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,320
for quite quite a bit of time I started

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,910
making those videos in about two

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,530
thousand eleven mostly because I want to

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,480
mess a little bit about rendering maps

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,430
and I had no idea how to do that so I

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,440
ended up doing one in Kensington then we

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,789
did some mapping for people familiar

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,440
with openstreetmap maps that the stalls

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,600
have changed quite a bit since all right

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,020
the the buildings are not nearly as as

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,420
grey anymore but it gave a possibility

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,920
of over the two or three weeks that

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,750
people were inputting the data to see

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,870
what the procas Exley was here in this

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,610
part of London it wasn't too spectacular

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,470
at all in the first days actually those

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,210
not exactly enough to me actually create

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,200
a video button but just included a

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:19,560
screenshot and set so the way how this

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:22,560
works is before mapping party I will get

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,700
the data sets and then when this happens

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,740
or afterwards I will actually use the

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,380
same sort of replication mechanism that

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,659
the open stream of website uses to get

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,369
new versions of the data and because I

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,290
can control when this happens i can

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,360
create frames on landis data there so

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,040
how do I do that I start out with

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,799
getting an extract from the area and

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,570
then I will grab a new data set every 15

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,310
minutes so I use open stream of

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,820
replication to say give me the next 50

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,890
minutes make sure I don't use too much

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,659
space because if you make a video like

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,630
this for a whole year you end up having

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,159
a lot of data and even in an area if no

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,200
no date has been changed there's no

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,310
reason for me to keep all the other

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,630
files find a cover photo calculate the

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,509
difference so I can do something to

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,830
difference to show what has changed for

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,540
each of the frames vendor and image

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,170
combine them into video and then add

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,209
some catchy

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,780
music so what do I need for this and

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:20,220
I've written a set of scripts that you

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,040
can download from get up that does all

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,260
the stuff for for you it is a bit hacky

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,360
it is still quite a key it costs a lot

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,099
of time to make but it's mostly time

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,950
that as your computer doing things then

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,810
you actually have to set up stuff so

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,209
extracting the data I have like this

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,680
configuration file thing don't bother

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,970
reading this all it's part of the gate

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,590
of repository if you want to play with

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,330
that but the ideas i start with a

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,610
dataset form before the mapping party

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,830
now once in a while people say oh can

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,870
you make this progress over this period

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,209
and then I need to find out a old

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,450
extract somewhere to as a starting point

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:57,180
from figure out which areas are going to

00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,660
create the changes from what sort of

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,459
zoom in zoom out how many frames per

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,060
minute and that kind of stuff you can

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:08,610
configure all this script and set up the

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,470
replication to actually do that so I set

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,299
up minute lee replication and i set the

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,840
interval to five to nine hundred seconds

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:18,359
that is 15 minutes run this and i can

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,820
run away the script so it does affect 15

00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:22,500
minutes every time however sometimes you

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,820
get 14 minutes and sometimes you got 60

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,900
minutes why that happens I don't know

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,760
and I seven figure it out so yeah you

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,190
get lots and lots of data falls out of

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,590
this lots of different states of the

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,450
data over time and if you have a large

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,840
area that takes a load a lot of time to

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,780
do that computer wise so I create an

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,040
image to go in the front wrote some

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,040
scripts that also title to it nothing

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,420
spectacular and then for each of the two

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,870
data sets that I have I create a

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,820
difference with osmosis this change file

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,010
tells me all the points that have

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,430
changed and widows points I can now draw

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,200
the changes on a map as own so the

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,359
points themselves are creating to an

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,400
image in this case it's an image with

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:06,660
lots of dots on it without a background

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,389
map you don't really know what it's

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,100
doing so for each frame there is a set

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:14,750
of points as well as the base map

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,609
underneath and I ran the each frame

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,169
separately through map Nick but only if

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:21,740
it's not the same as the previous one

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,700
otherwise it just takes extra time right

00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,460
calculate some other things around it

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,150
and then great image then off the image

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,050
is created I

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,669
I combine the dots with the base map to

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,940
show an overlay of the things that have

00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:39,180
been changed or edits do some blending

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,310
with the title there as well as combine

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,960
things into a movie and out some audio

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,270
which are used from kevin macleod

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,039
incompetech it has lots of tunes and

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,220
jingles and stuff like that so attitude

00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:53,759
which is all cc-by that you can use

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,380
freelance all right so last example so

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,470
I'll actually show you the map that I've

00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,940
created for people in Indonesia and i'll

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,690
just show you a few different things in

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,270
there how did I work again so this isn't

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,440
an easier two dots on it if you play

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,810
this for words you see all the changes

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,820
happening over years time and I now

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,210
needed two fingers to do this give me

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,889
seconds so this is the whole country I

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,060
don't actually create a basement for

00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:20,430
every frame because that would take too

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,729
much time it does it only every month if

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,020
you go to order size that I've done

00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:27,930
doing it for cities to see what has

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,210
changed in cities by images and you see

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,740
all the states around it and then it's

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,080
called for it's a little bit there's

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,270
lots of things happening there I also do

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,099
it for things but zooming and sometimes

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:42,889
when data only has changed into specific

00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:46,139
areas lots of things being added here

00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:48,570
here you I've not all the dots but I've

00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,190
all it's only to change the new data so

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,830
that it doesn't get lost in what exactly

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,510
rounded so there's lots of variance here

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,460
done with lots of different sets of data

00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,080
to show what the progress has been in

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,060
this case in Indonesia for the last one

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,159
and a half year alright that's it any

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,340
questions I think I only have time for

00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,340
one

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,000
yet go out I'll hand you the mic myself

00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,940
or that side thank you it is very

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,210
impressive I so that there are some

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:25,070
tools like a Chevy rimshot visualization

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:29,640
that has almost semi rendering and

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:34,020
couldn't we create ultimate is a shins

00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:35,820
to generate such things so yeah the ID

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,530
ID is actually instead of my set of

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
hacky script to have this ultimate it so

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,800
you can give your area and the time

00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,500
period and it does it for yourself the

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,670
prom is more that depending on what

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,230
you're trying to visualize you might

00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,390
want to tweak the parameters otherwise

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,790
you don't see the data or you see too

00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,350
little or too much so this it is a bit

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,150
of philly to get the initial set rights

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,130
to to make the videos out not only

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,140
showing everything but also making it

00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,310
look nice enough for for showing it

00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,140
happy to talk to you about that

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,140
