Title: Nicaragua's new crowd-sourced bus map: Lessons learnt
Publication date: 2016-10-13
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Friday QA
Description: 
	Eduardo Augusto Mayorga, Felix Delattre at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/nicaraguas-new-crowd-sourced-bus-map/

In Managua, Nicaragua, over 1.5 million inhabitants are dependent on public transport but until now there had been no map of the 45 bus lines. Using free technology, crowd-funding and the power of collaboration, engaged citizens worked together to create the first complete public transportation map of any Central American capital.

Felix and Eduardo Augusto will discuss how they achieved this, produced a web app, gave away 40,000 free printed maps and generated a GTFS feed for routing. Not only will they present the final products, but by sharing the lessons learnt during surveying and creating open data in a developing country, they hope to inspire you too.

everybody and we're glad to be here and

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,529
we want to thank you for your interest I

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,750
want to introduce you to our doma yoga

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,730
history is computer science at

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,250
university of engineering backing

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,410
Managua Nicaragua and got involved three

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,500
years ago in OpenStreetMap with

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,680
disparate we are here to present hello

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,650
hello everyone this is Felix the ladder

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,390
he is an open-source developer and GIS

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,640
specialist focused on participatory

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,700
technologies he started the

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,850
OpenStreetMap Nicaragua community while

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,370
he was living Nicaragua 14 years hello

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,370
this is rodrigo rodriguez he is a

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,530
digital communication consultant and he

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:51,030
is one of the first members in the open

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:53,610
source communities in Nicaragua so we

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,129
are here to present a project by map

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,829
Anika also known as open a strip of

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,320
Nicaragua Nicaragua community in this

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,470
project 200 people participated hang

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,689
around eight out of those 200 people

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,140
we're in the core group and only three

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,939
of us are here to present this project

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,189
an example of how free software and

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,130
openness to this web can be used to make

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,830
something wonderful to improve other

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,020
people's lives and why open data is so

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,460
important for a creative a sustainable

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,369
development but hey well Nicaragua um

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,130
where is it and how do you eat it was

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,860
Nikola why it's a small country not

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,540
everybody knows exactly what it is but

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,610
it's located in the center of the

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,909
American continent and in central

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,810
america between Costa Rica and Nicaragua

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:47,939
but don't undo this it's a beautiful

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,759
country surrounded by the Caribbean Sea

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:54,840
and the Pacific Ocean is a country of

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,420
volcanoes and legs and also wonderful

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,920
people sadly we also have to say it's

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,820
one of the poorest countries on the

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,240
American continent or more precisely may

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,590
be impoverished this talk is about

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,130
transit maps and when we talk about

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,930
rancid maps maybe from a perspective

00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,600
Europe we think hey that's normal

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,030
everybody has one but if you look to

00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,700
Latin America Africa huge parts of Asia

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,660
we actually see it's not a normality I

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:27,080
would even take a wild guess that

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:32,040
there's not even half of the cities

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:35,780
sorry with a transit network that have a

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,060
map of it Nicaragua it's the same and

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:45,180
but we were one of the first that were

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:47,790
able to create this map so the both

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,550
lines they grow with the city itself

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,070
there is no formal information available

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,020
so we had to survey that information by

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,570
ourselves we could not just imported

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,970
that into openstreetmap and a bus driver

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,030
even told us that when the first day he

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,890
went to duty for his job was driving he

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,410
didn't know where to go he has to ask

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,620
his own passengers were to turn around

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,410
because he had no idea and don't think

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,630
that in that picture the boss and the

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,540
label that they tell the destination it

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:23,370
says angel of love or something like

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,590
that so Manawa is kind of a messy city

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,470
is a beautiful city but is very messy

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,930
and mobility is a real problem not just

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,090
for people living there's about four

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,000
locals but also for visitors for firing

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,000
people so this means that people use

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,970
have has limited access to working

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,360
activities and leisure and so making

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,190
public transit understandable to AB to

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,080
everybody contributes to equal

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,840
opportunities because it is about

00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,760
development to provide service to the

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,150
economically active part of the

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,730
population but also about democratizing

00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,010
mobility and we as a community wanting

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,650
to change that we wanted to create a

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:08,520
state-of-the-art transit map for Managua

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,140
but a printer and web map and we wanted

00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,690
to make it sure is going to be freely

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,780
available not just as a free beer but

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:19,640
also as a freedom of speech and we

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,530
wanted to others to build on top of it

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,740
we're in times that some people call the

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,680
geospatial revolution

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,960
so technology and tools are available we

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,750
can use them especially within the osm

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,509
ecosystem and the knowledge is there so

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,160
we could learn how to do it we just

00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:40,990
needed the data we already had the tools

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,690
to create a product it was a lot of work

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,389
we couldn't do that completely by

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:49,060
ourselves we couldn't do that alone so

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,759
we engage local people people with look

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,360
at knowledge so that we could ask people

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,610
and empower so because if they have the

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,560
power to make their own map they have

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,560
the possibility they have the power or

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,599
their map if they can create it everyone

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,039
k created it changed the Macklin

00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:11,380
everyone can take part of it so open

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,940
srimati kahawa what is it well we are a

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,340
community of from many different

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,740
cultures and technical backgrounds and

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,949
we're doing this in mind from everybody

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,289
but especially for the bus users so we

00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:26,050
ask everybody who wants to help with it

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,909
to help to build a community because

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,020
several health things better than one

00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:33,460
and we counted with the participation of

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,590
enthusiasts from the local free software

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,650
community because floss communities in

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,419
Nicaragua are very United and we also

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,849
have the participation of university

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:44,889
students and engage in interested

00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:47,979
citizens actually we had a former

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:51,219
congressman participating ones so that

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:52,870
was quite kind of quite cool we built

00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:55,780
the community by organizing mapping

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,240
parties and over a lapse of two years

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,680
over 200 people learned how to map in

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,419
OpenStreetMap although all they helped a

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,289
lot together the basic data on the

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:10,030
network and editing in OpenStreetMap was

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:12,240
somehow complex however especially

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,889
public transportation because it's

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,590
involved it involves relations and all

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:24,099
this so at the end the core group was

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:26,409
doing most of the osm editing so the

00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:28,449
question is how are we going to do it

00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:30,940
what tune were we going to use for this

00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,400
task and we needed the right tools to

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,830
survey a deed and process the data and

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,430
the whole opening statement environment

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,520
has

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,980
perfect for us they were some choices

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,400
available for devices to soar beam and

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:48,130
software tour editing and making the map

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:53,470
but we prefer the simplest tools for

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:56,650
these people so we use GPS lovers too

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:59,470
small GPS chip and chip units for more

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,720
dangerous roads because we're not the

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,270
most dangerous country on the region but

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,900
we also have our own debt alley on the

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,190
city so at the end the android phones

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,970
resulted to be the best choice not only

00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:15,280
because you can they have GPS but also

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,400
because their ability of taking pictures

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:24,100
and record boys not as a note to the

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:27,760
logs and the easiest just preferred

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,420
application to Sir be on the ground with

00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,760
your mobile phone and Android

00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,130
specifically is awesome tracker it does

00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,290
everything you need for this for this

00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,450
job it takes pictures it records boss

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:44,830
and you can upload the crisis directly

00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:47,170
to openstreetmap we also used field

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,300
papers to draw the routes having

00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,310
information on paper was really useful

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,520
in case everything anything gets wrong

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,320
which happens you still have it on paper

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,210
or if you if something happens with the

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:05,860
paper you have it digitally so that was

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:08,350
great so we had to survey we could we

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,120
weren't able to find any transit

00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,910
information to import that into

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,970
openstreetmap automatically so we wrote

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:19,480
the bosses and took GPS traces we asked

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,730
the people we feel Oh passengers people

00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,240
waiting in the stop and even the bus

00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,980
drivers for a stop name so we the more

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,330
that the largest amount of people that

00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:33,400
we could ask and talk to was the largest

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:39,190
amount of local knowledge that we could

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:42,010
make make use of so while we marked we

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,710
survey the start position that's where

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,320
the bus stops and also the platforms

00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,880
that were people wait for the boss and

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,670
any missing row that

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,040
was part of any bus line but wasn't

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:56,530
already in OpenStreetMap and it was a

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,170
bit of a challenge to solve it this

00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:02,310
entitlement in managua one of the

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:05,950
difficulties for example is that the bus

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:09,090
lines or the driver detours from the

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,530
original route because of the traffic of

00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,890
competition with other bus drivers

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:20,410
construction work changing weather

00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:22,330
conditions or because the buses are

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,940
frequently used for other reasons in

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:28,150
this case political one but often times

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,730
there are rental for other activities so

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,320
I another challenge we have in this

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:37,890
beautiful project was the distribution

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:40,360
phase mostly because sorry the bus stops

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,360
mostly because of lack of urban planning

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,940
in the city bus stops have not named

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,890
ever before and usually the government

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,490
we're using long address descriptions

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:53,890
like those you see so we define the

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,710
names for the first time together with

00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:00,160
the bus of users so that lead us to the

00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,780
second thing which is the different that

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,550
the type of bus stops there are

00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,560
different type of bosses stops in

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:10,240
Managua so there are the official ones

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:13,210
which has a sign and a shelter but

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,160
usually if there's no sign it doesn't

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,770
need that the bus stop is not official

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,060
so you kind of have to know how to

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:24,040
identify it just by tradition maybe and

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,530
also there's the popular bosses tops

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,460
which are made by people and common

00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:33,070
sense for example at the corner of alpha

00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,980
block or at some grocery store in the

00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:40,150
main street and also you have finally

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:43,720
the other a third kind of bus stop which

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:46,180
are areas where you can stop the boss on

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,550
the man whatever you need also randall

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,410
parts of the city where small taxes or

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,080
motor taxes are the weight of

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,990
transportation we call them kappa naraz

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,910
and this issue actually is still not

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,690
completely resolved in OpenStreetMap

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:04,080
like how to map this informal transit

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:09,180
so if you have any comment about it

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:10,650
please give us some feedback it would be

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,810
very interesting to know how we could

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,580
map those kind of on-demand stops and

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,500
openstreetmap and there have been some

00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,590
discussion on the mailing list that we

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,910
would really like to get more into that

00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:23,220
but even they resolved part in

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,460
OpenStreetMap the classical transport

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,990
system is relatively complex and all I

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,820
stored in corresponding relations

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,370
there's the public transport schema to

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,190
that makes it that wasn't making it

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,580
really good for the volunteers to map

00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,040
and a good portion of work was actually

00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:43,350
went into verifying the data afterwards

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,770
and there was at this year's google

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,640
Summer of Code projects plugin for

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:53,100
jawsome which tire she's here and

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:56,340
developed PT assistant thanks for that

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,430
because it helped a lot to verify proper

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:02,670
data and we also were able to contribute

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:06,300
some patches too that's in there didn't

00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:08,190
do some verification on the bus stops so

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,810
this was one thing to get all the date I

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,730
in to get it verified to have good

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:15,510
quality and openstreetmap the other

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:19,110
challenge we wanted to get to is how we

00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:21,120
get to products the first product we

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,250
were able to do what's a simple web

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,320
application we created this for

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,680
ourselves to verify the data but then we

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,410
found out it's useful it's all open

00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,260
source simple stuff some libraries clue

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,300
together and it was good because we were

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,310
already able to get some feedback from

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,780
the people about correctness and all

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:45,810
that but our real goal we wanted to get

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,910
to was a paper map I think that's really

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,430
important to have one in the city and

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,800
there was never ever a problem at before

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,170
not in any country in Central America a

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,339
very few in whole Latin America and we

00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,230
were able with the tools of

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,500
openstreetmap just to create one and it

00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:04,800
was really cool the design is inspired

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,840
by digital matatus which was a project

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,270
on how to visualize

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,890
informal transit and we combine that

00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:15,160
with two Nicaraguan feel off to

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:18,640
perceiving maps as we also saw in the

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:22,120
keynote if streets hasn't have no names

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,180
which is the same issue in Nicaragua we

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,970
need other ways to find ourselves around

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:31,860
and orient ourselves so this is mostly

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:34,840
done by reference points rounds about or

00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,290
traffic lights so we included them in a

00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:41,280
map so people could understand the map

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:44,680
based on how they feel their own city

00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,590
and of course we wanted to print this

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,420
map therefore we were able to run a

00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:52,300
crowdfunding campaign together if the

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,520
humanitarian OpenStreetMap team a lot of

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,010
people sent their money and thanks a lot

00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,020
for that it was great and it made it

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:06,100
possible so we could prints the map for

00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:08,680
the thousand times and well now that we

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,990
have the printed maps we have the other

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,450
challenge which is the distribution and

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,970
so how to give maps to the people who

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,400
need them so we made an aliens with the

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,890
ticket office to distribute with them

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,620
the maps and we also gave them directly

00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,990
to the bus users on the street you know

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,930
in one of the main bosses tops of the

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,850
city that day people had a proper boost

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,320
map in their hands for the first time of

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,390
their life and the four and for the

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,780
first time of the city's life also and

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:40,000
we invited press to cover the event so

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,280
other people could tell they have

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,660
already our transit map of the public

00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:48,640
transport system the users and

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:52,300
especially the bus drivers like the map

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,460
a lot all this is to be understood as a

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,920
intelligent proposal based on

00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,800
crowdsourcing we are not a public

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,090
transit agency and weird we're guessing

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,770
what's what is the transit network and

00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,780
to improve this data which is gathered

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,000
by crowdsourcing what could you do we do

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,460
more crowdsourcing so we are trying to

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,480
establish methods how people can provide

00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,480
easily feedback

00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:22,089
and we did it with a simple web form so

00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:25,480
that the goal was to lower the barrier

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:28,679
to make it easier for people to give us

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,959
information to correct and make the map

00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:34,660
even better and we received hundreds of

00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:37,449
emails from people telling us this is

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,489
wrong and please check it and fix it and

00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:42,100
people who are making sure that the map

00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:46,839
that they were using were correct the

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:49,660
local knowledge was really important so

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:53,499
the next step is to provide a trip

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,089
planning service we won routing so this

00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:58,209
is a service that tell you where to go

00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:00,879
with lines you should use from going to

00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:03,160
point to place a to place B and the

00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,699
existing technology that the surface

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,829
already developed for the solution

00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:11,679
assumes are rigid schedule and though we

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:14,169
don't have that in managua and it means

00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,689
that's why the greens are absolutely

00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:18,609
changing or adapting to the northern

00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:22,329
style of public transport but it works

00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:24,429
for now so we want to generate this

00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:26,289
information with this data for this

00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:28,569
software available and in order to

00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:30,759
generate or develop a schedule

00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:34,689
information for every booth we need the

00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:36,879
schedule for every stop in the chance

00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:39,429
for network and we serve it the

00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:42,970
observable frequency of the boss how

00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:45,519
often though do then arrive at all the

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,649
stops so that we use that for an

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:52,089
estimation and the operation time ratio

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:55,779
also at which time it starts the part

00:16:52,089 --> 00:17:01,779
the first and the last boss in the day

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:03,850
or in weekdays and also for weekends so

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:07,510
having this information frequencies we

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,809
could start to to also intelligently

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:13,000
against a schedule and come up with the

00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:15,819
GTFS standard which is general

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,039
transferred specification and this

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:21,189
format would allow us to put the data

00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:23,980
into existing open source tools to

00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:26,020
provide those routing efforts we wanted

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:29,230
to to give

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,660
if we are still in progress with that we

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,990
are programming on or via collaborating

00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:38,920
on a project Oh smtg TFS so if you're

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,870
into GTFS please come to us and talk to

00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:46,660
us we would also like to get feedback

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:49,420
from you and help once we have it we can

00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,000
then use it in android app transporter

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:55,060
or the famous open trip planner this is

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,930
easily possible and we also put in white

00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:00,850
to everybody to use our data in their

00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,340
apps if they're commercially or not

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,770
because we think the more it's used to

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,800
better it's for the people because all

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:12,250
this is open data and it's no vector in

00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,440
there because we really publish

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,750
everything under open data so this means

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,520
the raw data it means the final product

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,490
that means the design that means really

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,320
the code it means everything um and when

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,350
we talk about open data you should we

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,510
talk about government publishing data

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,610
for the people but we also think that

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:33,880
people could generate data and we did it

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:37,120
and we want to provide it to anybody

00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,540
else we see it as as a commitment to

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,440
equity give development and we hope that

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:46,870
everybody can build on top of it and

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,150
what we already have the first consumer

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:52,990
of our data it's an app from the

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:55,960
sandanista movement organization and

00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:58,900
it's not the best public transit up but

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,400
it's a very good start and we're happy

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,770
and proud that the government is using

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,650
our data to improve people's life and

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,850
because that that's all we always wanted

00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,000
that's why we started the project

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:15,610
actually and because this is also open

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,500
data like the other way around so as you

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,960
can see it's possible to create

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,730
something new and wonderful to improve

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,370
other people's lives be using the tools

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:27,010
around openstreetmap openstreetmap is

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,510
there for you to make these kind of

00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,880
projects to make innovation especially

00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:33,490
in countries where there is a lot to do

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,220
with openstreetmap everyone can have a

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:38,620
transit map so this is just one example

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,460
and we would like to thank all the free

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,630
software develop

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:45,820
that make this possible we hope we could

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,850
inspire you with this showcase thanks a

00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:51,070
lot we are open to any collaboration if

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,289
you feel that you can collaborate

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,830
somehow in with this project feel free

00:19:53,289 --> 00:20:00,399
to reaches you can visit us at map anika

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:02,500
dotnet you can not only see them up but

00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:04,480
also download the data and try to play

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,309
with it and you can follow us also on

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,770
Twitter on Facebook and thank you for

00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:11,250
your interest and your attention and we

00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:18,879
wish you a happy mapping

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:28,279
[Applause]

00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:31,370
any question are coming any any

00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:35,840
questions we got one here I think my

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:39,230
smart phones working so if you've never

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,809
seen a transit map before you've never

00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,759
held one before and you suddenly get one

00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:46,850
in your hands what's that experience

00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,340
like and I mean is it are you able to

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:55,519
use it right away or you know any

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:57,740
thoughts well we have maybe a little bit

00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:01,759
challenging step which is like the

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:04,970
validating validation for the for the

00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:07,580
map but actually in the first days we

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:11,419
launched them up the printer map we got

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:15,200
a lot of feedback via the web forum and

00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:18,080
we don't actually we didn't receive any

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,960
negative feedback we mostly most of the

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,379
feedback were like for fixing some data

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,750
or congratulating the effort and people

00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:28,879
were like very happy you could see it

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,950
like when we gave the people's map

00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:33,590
people like grab them up and say like

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,690
wow cool this is cool and they were like

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,059
playing or trying to understand actually

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:41,840
the the printed map and it was pretty

00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:44,480
pretty fun pretty cool we we hope that

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,250
they could understand we got we got the

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,620
feeling that they understand they

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:51,470
understood them up but we haven't done

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:54,230
any validation jet respect to do it on

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,230
the next month I would like to add that

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,840
I would see it as well as a process so

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,559
once there's a map it's not that they're

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,809
completely used to use it immediately

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:08,090
but it's fun to play with it and I think

00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:11,059
over time it starts making more and more

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,769
sense for more and more people and you

00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:16,450
have you have to start and then people

00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:16,450
learn how to read it this one

00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:28,769
Thanks and what do you see what what is

00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:31,049
the reason or what was the obstacle for

00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:33,480
the local government to establish a map

00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:36,299
by that so is it as I understand that

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,659
the different service providers would

00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:42,059
the the different service providers have

00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:44,010
their own map of their services or no

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:46,289
one has any kind of map and therefore

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,210
the local municipality wouldn't invest

00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:51,210
anything like that oh why it never

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,429
happened before well actually boss limes

00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:56,039
different bus lines are operated by

00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:59,029
different companies so this means that

00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:01,169
they often compete with each other for

00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:03,450
passengers in the road and the kind of

00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:07,110
tough and the government they they

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:11,130
haven't provided they haven't published

00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:15,360
any information in digital media nor

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:19,200
other in other form so they do we only

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,659
found some PDF files in in which you

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,610
couldn't see the stops at least of the

00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:30,419
stops for every for all the lines and we

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:33,330
use that PDF files for getting a sense

00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,490
of how to name the bus stops but the

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,370
government agency they don't provide any

00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:42,299
they haven't published any information

00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:45,419
that we could use directly to import

00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:47,760
that into openstreetmap in addition

00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:51,090
there were some local newspapers that

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,799
publish maps of the transit public

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,799
system but actually they were not

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:59,250
complete or they were not understandable

00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:01,620
because they are have like all the boss

00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:06,269
liners on the same street so you could

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:09,169
see like 25 different colors or steins

00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:12,169
in the same street and it wasn't very

00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:12,169
understandable

00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:33,559
okay hurry the process of generating a

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:36,379
schematic map from OpenStreetMap data

00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,720
like a map where the all the lines are

00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:40,519
at 45 degree angles and I guess the

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,990
labels don't overlap can that be

00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:47,389
automated or does it have to be done

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:49,730
manually and we ended up doing it by

00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:51,909
hand and there was a lot of work and we

00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:55,940
would have loved to do it automated I

00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:58,070
think there is no technical solution out

00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,190
there is one commercial which I don't

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:05,299
want to mention and it didn't work and

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:08,210
but there's no free open source solution

00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:11,539
on that and there's a quite interesting

00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:15,769
master thesis that and that investigates

00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:17,750
how to do it properly so it's something

00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:19,909
that it would be very interesting

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:23,450
actually to dive into it and and then

00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:27,019
make this happening yeah could you name

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,690
them who's master thesis is the name of

00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:37,840
the paper yeah how do i flank automated

00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:40,399
metro maps 2007 University of Kent UK

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,389
automated made from maps something like

00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:49,759
that automated Metro you will find it in

00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:52,309
the front do the buses actually run on

00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,549
schedule really I mean I just wondered

00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:57,409
if that was and um if there was any

00:25:55,549 --> 00:26:02,299
possibility of putting trackers in the

00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:05,149
buses well the the bosses are as far as

00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:07,970
we know they are they they have gps

00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:10,220
units with them and when you pay the

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,279
ticket there is an electronic card that

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,289
it's supposed to keep track of the boss

00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:18,379
but that information is only available

00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:20,809
for the company operate the company that

00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:25,460
operates the bus lines and we we have

00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:27,830
try to get that information for it to

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,539
use for us but it's not that easy

00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,999
because we have to you have

00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:36,109
no the right people to get in touch with

00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:39,080
to get that access to that data to the

00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:41,389
data but we don't know that people yet

00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,389
that the defendant they contact the

00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:46,940
point of contact to get that data it's

00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:49,879
it's supposed to be available the GPS

00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:54,979
units are in the bosses but we don't we

00:26:49,879 --> 00:27:01,899
don't have that access maybe one more

00:26:54,979 --> 00:27:04,700
question so neither thirst thank you

00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:06,379
okay the very annoying question what

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,479
about long-term sustainability of the

00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:10,070
data it takes a lot of times of you guys

00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:12,109
to keep it alive how do you guarantee

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:16,879
that the data stays fresher in the long

00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:19,220
run I'm not sure if I understood a

00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:23,090
question probably but how do we maintain

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:26,749
the data is just your question yes we've

00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:29,299
as we explained we think that the more

00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:32,149
the data is used the more feedback we

00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:34,190
can obtain from people so through more

00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:35,929
crowdsourcing and more crowdsourcing we

00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:39,460
get more feedback and more feedback and

00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:43,190
thus improve data quality also over time

00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:46,309
cope questions this is an interesting

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,340
topic maybe can we thank our speakers

00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:51,460
here and it's been a great morning

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,460
