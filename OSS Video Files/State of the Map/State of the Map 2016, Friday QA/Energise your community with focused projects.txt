Description: 
	Rob Nickerson and Gregory Marler (both on behalf of Brian Prangle) at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/energise-your-community-with-focused-projects/

Building a community from scratch? Trying to expand an early OpenStreetMap community? Brian will share his experiences from recent projects in the UK. These include national mapping projects and collaborations with UK local authorities. A number of projects will be described (from mapping schools to automatic traffic flow management) and some hints provided on what works well and what doesnâ€™t.

our next speaker according to the

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:09,389
program is Brian panggil he

unfortunately can't make it to a cycling

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,670
accident I don't know if he was mapping

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:18,420
at the time but being Brian it he

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:23,070
probably was instead we got rotten Rob

Nixon and this is from the UK it's about

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:31,230
energize your community with focused

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:35,219
projects and I'll also help if Rob had

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:39,660
some questions bright brian is okay he's

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:43,739

that work you hear me good super well

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,250
the title is energized your community

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,330
and I do have to apologize um I don't

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,630
really have a great deal of energy

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,119
myself today if anybody's ever organized

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,430
the conference I have a ton of respect

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,960
for you it's been a right challenge and

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,450
you don't get much sleep in the last

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,220
week so fingers crossed i'll stay awake

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,020
and we'll get through this one and it's

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,600
a bit of a hotchpotch of themes and

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,280
topics as well because it's been a bit

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,500
last-minute its presentation but

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,430
hopefully he'll come together we'll take

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,740
a look and see how it goes so yeah i'm

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,950
rob nicholson mapper murcia as a

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,320
community i'm part of which is in the

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,869
Midlands and

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,850
yeah a little bit about me i discovered

00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:14,450
openstreetmap when I was back at

00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:17,570
University didn't quite have the time to

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,620
participate then and so a few years

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,300
later I joined the project in 2011

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,190
partly because I'm a keen Walker and I

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,080
like to go out and explore the

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:34,310
countryside you a and map what I see my

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,940
paid job is entirely unrelated to osm so

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:41,630
I'm volunteer other people would call me

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:48,770
a no I'm not going to use that C word I

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:51,170
am an organic mapper and if you've not

00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,400
seen the how to do contribute website

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,650
encourage you to go and have a look at

00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,260
that is really interesting so matt baume

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,600
mercier this is the community in the UK

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,300
in the Midlands it's named after a

00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:09,860
historic kingdom the kingdom of Mercia

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,720
and we celebrated 10 years in August so

00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,200
it's the community that's been around a

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:20,930
long time it's grown and shrunken grown

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:23,180
and shrunk over the years and yes a

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,220
small core of people that keep keep it

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,530
maintained we have a regular meeting

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,840
it's always the first wednesday of the

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,900
month which makes it easier to remember

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,570
when the meetings are we're not a very

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,630
tanky group we focus on mapping and

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:41,630
local outreach but we do have a website

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:44,030
mapa murcia talk if you want to check

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:51,079
out our website and the few things that

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:53,360
are on their main one being a blog ok so

00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:59,060
this hasn't come up quite right with its

00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:02,720
supposed to be animated but successes we

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:05,180
have a community we developed first

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,700
gripping a gritting maps this is the

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,890
roads in the winter in the UK when they

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,769
go all iced over the trucks go out and

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,000
grip them with sand with salt and grit

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,489
to

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,640
sure that you don't slip on the road in

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,220
the UK it's all split by local authority

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,670
and each them had their own little map

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,440
we went out spoke to local authorities

00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,570
collected their data and brought it in

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,750
to openstreetmap so you can go on our

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:35,150
website map of mercy org and see a grip

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,190
map for the West Midlands region rather

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,700
than having to go to five six seven

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,970
different local authorities and the next

00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,730
image that's in there is apologize you

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:50,419
can't see these is a state of the map

00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:52,790
2013 so we helped to organize stated

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:56,330
them up 2013 you would before I would

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,700
have learnt at apparently not that was a

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,669
great success we really enjoyed it 300

00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:05,330
people there it's good to see so many

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:08,630
here again today my personal favorite is

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,390
the next one the election results so it

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,950
wasn't a particularly big use of

00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,200
OpenStreetMap data but one of our local

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,440
councils warwickshire county council

00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,890
chose to use openstreetmap as their

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,290
background map for displaying their

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:27,410
election results during council

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:29,690
elections and that was live in the

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,770
counting room as those were coming in I

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,840
thought that was a particularly

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:36,890
fantastic use of openstreetmap being

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,380
used at such an official event the next

00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:43,400
one that's in there is a group called

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,680
anawim which is support female and in

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,830
the particular area that we worked in it

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,080
was the probation service so they were

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,540
looking for a number of activities that

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,410
their women could do as probations

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,000
they're paying back to the community and

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,340
they've got typical normal things sort

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,169
of a manual work and working in a

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,120
charity but they're after some other

00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:06,710
activities and they came across us as a

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,080
group and we were really interested in

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,120
the concept of mapping so we went along

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,400
and trained some of their women up on

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,860
the preparation surface and they started

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,110
contributing to openstreetmap as their

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,850
Community Payback and some of them

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,950
really got into it and started doing in

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,960
their free time as well and they learnt

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,169
a new skill one of the things that

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,699
anawim focuses on this is

00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,699
shirin people are learning a new skill

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:37,360
and the last two images are to do with

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,310
smart data and so we started to work

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,590
with Birmingham City Council this year

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:46,990
who are interested in traffic management

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,120
and they have sensors in the road and

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,129
neglect the data to do with number of

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,080
cars passing it's that all the traffic

00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:55,659
lights so where you see on the traffic

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,669
light there's a score in the ground and

00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:59,499
they've got effectively a loop in there

00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:01,659
that counts the cars coming through and

00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:03,310
they can actively traffic traffic manage

00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:05,740
and adjust the traffic lights

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,210
accordingly they were looking for a

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,060
platform in which to put that

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,310
information and found openstreetmap and

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,289
again we we train them up it show them

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,180
how to use it and the council got some

00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:18,039
of their own staff going out and mapping

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,509
and they also worked with their service

00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:25,300
provider one of the local and

00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:27,370
construction companies to collect that

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,889
data and put it in and that's now grown

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,899
into this Birmingham smart city Alliance

00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,599
project who have now taken an interest

00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:37,360
in OpenStreetMap as a way of recording

00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,830
live you know keeping the map up-to-date

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,800
and as live as possible to all the

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:45,759
changes so that was some of our

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:49,089
successes as Matt for mercy yeah but we

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,129
also have a challenge the challenge is

00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:54,550
that even though the local community

00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:56,939
meet every month it's become harder and

00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:00,430
harder to maintain a large community

00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:02,139
post that initial mapping part it's so

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,300
when you go out at first and there's no

00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:06,399
road map tande this oh passed mapped

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,249
it's very clear it's very obvious what

00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,469
you can do it's very exciting but as

00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:13,479
that data fills in it becomes hard and

00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:15,460
harder than know what's left to map

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,099
there's still plenty to do but it's

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,310
quite difficult to see it at first until

00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:23,319
you really get deep into the data so the

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,930
buzz of those initial mapping parties

00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,240
has started to fade but we had a bigger

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,620
challenge but we got more two more to

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,279
keep up to date now that we're mapping

00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:36,380
the shops and facilities trying to keep

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,630
all of that dynamically changing

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,910
information up-to-date and relevant is a

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:44,210
big challenge and it requires a lot of

00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:45,800
support a big community as well we

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,160
wanted to recapture some of the buzz of

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:52,990
the early days and obviously bigger

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,990
community is helping to spread the load

00:08:53,590 --> 00:09:02,690
so we we decided to focus on a

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:06,190
coordinated and coordinated effort so we

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,420
introduced this UK quarterly projects

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,310
and this was inspired by something that

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,340
openstreetmap used to have in terms of

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,320
weekly projects and monthly projects are

00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:19,100
a in with it was not necessarily to

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:23,840
improve the map but it was to improve

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:26,090
the community as well their quarterly so

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,350
that this time to build momentum but

00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:31,910
also people have time to do their own

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,070
things we don't want to divert

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,600
everybody's energy onto the quarterly

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,070
project we know everybody's got their

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,610
own interests and things they like to

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,050
map so given three months for the

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,250
project meant they could help us a

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:48,320
little bit with the project but also

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:50,450
have time to do their own thing and it's

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,580
meant to be fun it's not supposed to be

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:58,730
any targets there's no competitions or

00:09:52,580 --> 00:10:01,240
numbers they have to hear on this so

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,460
here are the projects we've done so far

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,760
we started with road names back in q1

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,470
2015 we will enter deliveries or

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,980
anything to do with delivery post boxes

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:16,210
delivery hubs depots then during the

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,670
late summer we did a visitor attractions

00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,900
and then finish with nature reserves

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,220
other than this year we've done schools

00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:27,620
healthcare and we're currently on farms

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:31,270
each has a mixed appeal the schools

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:33,500
project was by far our biggest success

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,530
it's something everybody could connect

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,530
to

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,760
I can realize what I've done I've got an

00:10:40,300 --> 00:11:08,980
old slide I can do you mind if I just

00:10:42,760 --> 00:11:12,190
switch hope so fresh Rob's told me to

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,810
fill in and he vaguely told me what

00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,410
slide so we did about the schools that

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:19,540
this is one that I saw so I'm i live in

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,060
the UK as well but up in durham and we

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,460
don't really have a openstreetmap

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,580
communities that there I my nearest

00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:30,340
strong communities Edinburgh the schools

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,710
was exciting we tried to figure out why

00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,250
it was one of our best ones I think

00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:38,530
sometimes it's just a case of time that

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,840
you know it was a time personally that I

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,640
had time for openstreetmap and could

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,530
edit this I don't know if it was time of

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,250
year that seemed to link with other

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:49,900
people could do it and also there's a

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,210
bit of I mean schools are something that

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,360
should be on a map it's exciting to get

00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:59,010
in detail and all the schools not just

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,600
the ones where matters know your side

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,880
there were also a data source where we

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,260
could get a list of the schools check

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,900
their names are right and in

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,670
OpenStreetMap and it gave this kind of

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,820
tick list for people so that's only

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,830
helps and a few people built tools

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,070
around that so that we can get the stats

00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,300
so that we can find the schools and a

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:24,130
probable hopefully have a slide on that

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:26,260
when it gets it up but it it was on and

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,750
there's also vivid I found the big

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,610
travel thing I mean schools are

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,920
everywhere so you can kind of get to

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,170
them but you can also see where they are

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,890
quite easily on aerial imagery and you

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:42,520
can trace the area of the school as well

00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,470
as the building and then if you want to

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,020
go out and survey because that's good

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,760
and important to you know there's

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,290
probably a school near you that you can

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:56,470
go and check whether

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:58,240
entrances and and find that and it's

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,040
been good for me cuz I'd been outside

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,350
that I haven't had the regular meetups

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,259
that I'd been able to talk through

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,209
online and a and link up with acts of

00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:14,529
being good community was that good Billy

00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:16,899
I was so sorry that's what happens to

00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,399
sleep deprivation hopefully I got the

00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:22,839
right slide right now and hopefully I'll

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:26,139
progress on the challenge was to do with

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:30,569
schools and school mapping and wanting

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:34,350
crates under those and then to be fun

00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:36,639
and these are the projects we worked on

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,199
so for the school's project because that

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,930
was the one that attracted most

00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:43,329
attention and most bus we already had

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,899
some tools this is the item map for

00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:48,550
schools but we developed quite a new a

00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:50,740
few new ones and we started by

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,860
collecting the local data and if anybody

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:56,079
knows the UK it's a devolved its powers

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,990
to Scotland and Wales for school so it's

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,089
not a simple case of grabbing one data

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,160
set you have to collect it all together

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,930
this is the one for England there was 14

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,639
when I was 14 Scotland one for Northern

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,339
Ireland and if you want to push out onto

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,230
the islands of Isle of Man and so on

00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:13,149
there was different and different data

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:18,010
sets as well for those but so we started

00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:19,690
by collecting them all together and one

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,000
of our one of our members robert

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,339
whittaker built this tall so he loaded

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,500
in the official data and did a matching

00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:29,319
with OpenStreetMap data to compare it

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,880
and developed a tool work is by post

00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:32,529
code which is quite good booze and we

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,750
could have a bit of a see which post

00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:40,870
code gets completed first and Harry

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:43,149
would also developed a system for that

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,180
where you could track number of edits

00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:48,880
per day who was editing who edited in

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:53,740
the last hour who has in last day and

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,569
overall and it was possible to get a

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,610
ranking as I say we said to the

00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:58,959
community this is not a competition you

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,519
know the numbers are there if you're

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,150
interested if you want to have a little

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,860
thing between yourselves then go

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,940
but you know we're not we're not

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,620
promoting it as a competition here and

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:18,240
that worked over all you could also do

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:21,750
the last day in so here's here's a chart

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,390
of how we achieve so it's just over the

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,220
three-month mark that's shown here oddly

00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,830
at first we actually the number of

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,390
schools decreased and that's because we

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,160
realized there's a lot of bad data and

00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,110
openstreetmap so we went for a cleansing

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,420
process so this was usually when a

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,250
school was marked as a way but also

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,950
still had a note on there so we went

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:43,980
through removing the nodes and turning

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:50,330
the data into really high-quality marked

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:52,500
ways we did a lot of blogging as well

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,240
that was one of the things to try and

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:58,770
keep the energy up and keep the activity

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,220
up so this is a blog post we did to do

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:04,260
with one particular night in the night

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,550
of your mapping schools to try and get

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:11,070
as many people on that one particular

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:12,900
evening mapping as possible and we

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,840
blogged on some of the stats as well so

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,000
when people are editing associates back

00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,430
sort of Friday and Saturday a quarter

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,370
days and you get a peak in the middle of

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:28,650
the week so where do we get to so going

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,600
back to Robert Whitaker's char split by

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,520
postcode region this is where we started

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,640
and you can see quite a lot of the

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,860
regions of fifty percent maps and this

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,690
is mapped as a way as a closed area to

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,600
mapped in detail rather than map just as

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,760
nodes and there's hot spots of green and

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,990
that tends to be where there's a strong

00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,580
community and there's a lot of mappers

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,740
there's also some worse off areas the

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,830
North West of England in and around

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,940
Manchester was struggling and that's

00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,140
probably because we don't have a very

00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,140
strong community in that region

00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:07,530
and that's where we ended up so we turn

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:12,230
that map green it's not finished it's

00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,230
not 100% clean finished but we got there

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:22,589
so in terms of the the stats so 362

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:25,289
people making 15,000 edits so this is

00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:32,010
each time they touch a amenity equal

00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:34,500
school object of which 3,600 new schools

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,230
were mapped mapped as a way as a closed

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,210
area so really good quality data rather

00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:41,370
than just the point nodes which is what

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,500
the import data was we didn't import it

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:49,380
but that's what the the third party data

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:55,169
was it was just the note 19 people

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:58,190
managed over 250 edits 100 130 just the

00:17:55,169 --> 00:18:00,690
one edit but each of them count equally

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:05,549
thankful for every person who edits them

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:11,100
up and the highest number of schools

00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:13,770
edited per day was just over 400 so in

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,360
terms of mapping schools his way ways we

00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,630
increase that from an average of

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,330
sixty-three percent 75% so now 75% of

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:25,110
the schools in the UK a mapped in detail

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:29,250
as closed ways and as I say we cleaned

00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:31,530
up a lot of old or bad data never thing

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,890
we learnt a lot about our community we

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:37,380
learnt a lot about how we work and we

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,970
inspired the Belgium community to set up

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,299
for something similar and they use some

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,730
of the same tools and the tracker tools

00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:46,260
were also used in Uganda for they were

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,789
doing an import in this case but they

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:53,640
made use of the tracker tool was to keep

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:57,600
an eye on how that went so what are we

00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:02,280
learn about the community so obviously

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,809
most engaged cities the most map cities

00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,820
that should say tend to be the ones that

00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:10,470
have got a local community and they get

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:12,780
engaged some parts of the UK are really

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,340
struggling to attract matters and this

00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,330
is big challenge for us there's some

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,940
regions that just

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,460
have active matters so it's mentioned

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,080
the northwest is one into Wales where

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,130
it's quite remote that's another region

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,620
we're struggling to find active mothers

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,180
competitions can be good can be bad you

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,950
know some people complained when we put

00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,600
those rankings up that it was too much

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,440
of a competition but other people it

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,510
inspired them to go out and do more it's

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,680
really tough to attract new people into

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:45,240
openstreetmap and there needs to be a

00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,650
balance of communication you need to

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,500
communicate a bit to people get the idea

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,700
but not overwhelm them of why so feel

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,710
like they're being pressured too much

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,510
into the project again that's why we did

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:59,040
it over a quarter to give people the

00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:01,140
time picking a project that fun for

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,440
everybody is tough so the schools work

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,270
really well i'm not quite sure why dan

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,980
connect to schools because you went to

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,170
the school at one point in your life and

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:14,400
wherever its figures they're easy to see

00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:16,830
from visually from above on the aerial

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,080
mapping oh i'm not entirely sure but

00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,270
that was a really successful ones of

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,480
projects or struggle to attract that

00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:29,820
many people what do we learn about the

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,830
tools the visualization is must have it

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,780
really did help in this project and some

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,430
of the other quarterly projects that

00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,900
didn't have the visualization they

00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:41,820
struggled as a consequence that mix of

00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,410
remote mapping and local mapping I think

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:48,930
that's essential so that people can get

00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:52,260
involved from wherever they are data

00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:54,180
imports shock horror they don't work in

00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,910
this case they don't work because it was

00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:00,300
no data and we wanted areas there was

00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:03,830
also errors in the data and we struggled

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,830
with the merging and matching process

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,720
but also community mapping alone doesn't

00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:17,160
work not with community we've got the

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,330
size it is at the moment there's too

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,330
much to keep on top of

00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:26,980
and some of the tasks are quite

00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,990
repetitive and dull so where we can

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:34,570
bring in some sort of automation that

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:38,679
would be really great personally I think

00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:45,159
we really struggle with a simple editors

00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:47,559
that just do one function and mobile is

00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:51,330
that the missing link a lot of our tools

00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:54,659
and sources were desktop based solutions

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:58,149
mapping is an activity you do outdoors

00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,649
so it's a quick sidetrack I'm mobile is

00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:01,869
a bit of a pet project for me and as

00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:05,740
I've taken this talk off off of Brian

00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:07,539
I'll do my own little sidetrack the

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,220
going mobile so whether the school's

00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:10,450
projects and perhaps not with schools

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,129
because you don't want to send people

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,139
out going photographing schools that's

00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:16,330
probably not the best idea but with

00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:19,480
other projects you know a simple tool

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:21,909
way you can just open up an app on your

00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,279
phone and say what's around me that I

00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:26,470
need to map and how do we capture that

00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:28,840
Pokemon go essence you know what

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,490
inspired those people to go out and you

00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:35,080
know spend hours trying to catch pokemon

00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:39,639
can we get them catching post boxes for

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:41,980
example like you know go out with a

00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:43,809
simple out collect that you know find

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,549
something either you load it with the

00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:46,809
third party data and you tell them where

00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,879
we think it is and they go and confirm

00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:51,159
it's there or you just say go and find

00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:55,809
you know post box and take a photo of it

00:22:51,159 --> 00:23:02,470
and add it into the map we've got some

00:22:55,809 --> 00:23:05,139
unanswered questions as well so we've

00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,659
done our quarterly projects as themed so

00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:10,480
far but we know that some areas struggle

00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:12,580
so perhaps we could focus on a local

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:17,379
region so if anybody's got an experience

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:19,029
of that very interested and we still

00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:22,059
need the help with branching out and

00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:26,080
developing a new community and also with

00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:27,639
some of those tools and as the UK we're

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,940
in the process of setting up for a

00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:34,000
registered company hopefully through

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,560
that we'll be able to fund and

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,710
answer things and the initiatives that

00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:41,020
we have so feel free to talk to me about

00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:50,740
those and thank you and Paula jeez about

00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:53,410
the slides not entirely sure I've left

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,580
time for questions so I'll pass on to

00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,980
the next speaker if you've got an

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,790
especially nice attachment it's mr.

00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,790
paper quick

00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:40,249
so the question was have we considered

00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:43,849
focusing on laughing on places that

00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:45,589
really need nothing yeah I guess that's

00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:49,159
that's the question we're asking you so

00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:51,049
far we focused on themes schools farms

00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:53,059
should we be focusing on a particular

00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:54,619
area so we know that way all this is

00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,820
struggling the Northwest having the

00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:59,389
struggling should we just bring

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,309
everybody's attention yeah well there's

00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:04,190
already a missing maps and the hot

00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:06,440
project available for that so this is a

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,809
you know people continue to those as

00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,299
well that's why we've done this as a

00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:13,099
quarterly project so that you know we're

00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:14,719
not drawing everybody's attention away

00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:16,999
from their own interest so they can go

00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:19,309
and map what they want but chip in five

00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:24,489
minutes here or there to the UK project

00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:24,489
