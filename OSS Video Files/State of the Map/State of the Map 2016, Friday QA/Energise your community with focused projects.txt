Building a community from scratch? Trying to expand an early OpenStreetMap community? Brian will share his experiences from recent projects in the UK. These include national mapping projects and collaborations with UK local authorities. A number of projects will be described (from mapping schools to automatic traffic flow management) and some hints provided on what works well and what doesnâ€™t.
