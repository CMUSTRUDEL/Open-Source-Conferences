Title: Vector tiles from OpenStreetMap
Publication date: 2016-10-13
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Friday QA
Description: 
	Lukas Martinelli at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/vector-tiles-from-openstreetmap/

The OSM2VectorTiles project offers free downloadable vector tiles from OpenStreetMap data ready to use by people interested in hosting custom base maps on their own infrastructure. The whole world fits on a USB stick and can be served from an ordinary web hosting and styled and enriched to make beautiful and fast maps for web and mobile applications.

After this talk you will know how to create and publish your own custom styled maps based on completely Open Source vector tiles. You will also learn how to host vector tiles yourself or use them completely offline. We are map enthusiasts who want to make OpenStreetMap accessible for everyone again.

I'll just let everyone sit down quickly

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,610
and you got the microphone over to you

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,110
Lucas and back to town okay so I will

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,700
tell a bit about the rector Charles from

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,230
OpenStreetMap it will be a bit technical

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,130
but that tried to make it interesting

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,930
for everyone thank you and I will tell

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,710
you what vector tells or why should you

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,140
care and our project which will help OS

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,550
m as well and so it is not just me there

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,500
are a lot of other people on the road

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,960
with which could not be here

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,399
Stephan Keller Patrick cradle and

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,469
Aamir's amo is here in the audience

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,440
somewhere so they're working on that as

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,239
well and ten other mappers and we were

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,940
up the past year on this project and

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,730
that start this university project and

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,910
we get some infrastructure funding from

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,579
cloaking technologies and thank for that

00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,980
so and what salvation so what we want to

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,660
do for developers or for other people is

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,420
to enable everyone to create their own

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,420
map based on Open Street Map so you can

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,609
have your own cast map style it like you

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,680
like you want like a pirate map or I

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,170
don't know what you like and enable

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,439
people to do that and all of that open

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,619
source and free and so what are these

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,650
tiles and in the earlier days like 2005

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,990
when you browse a web page with a map

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,490
you just got one large image and each

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,100
time you scroll together not a large

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,530
image then Google came up with the idea

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,299
let's slice that large image into many

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,920
small square images tiles and so this

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,200
gives you better performance because it

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,490
loads many of these small tiles and you

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,189
see here you have an index so one tile

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,990
always covers exactly the same area why

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,540
does that matter we had a lot of good

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,579
properties from this you can now pre

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,280
compute it and you can cache it and you

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,740
can render a map once for there and it

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,409
will always you can always request it

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,600
and don't have to rerender it so tiles

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,640
and a few years later we have vector

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,420
tiles so now clients are more powerful

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,329
and we can now have nets on our phones

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,000
in the browser and they actually render

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,039
the map on the client side and to do

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,720
that we now no longer sent the image but

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,730
vector data to the

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,370
and because we learned tarts are great

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,820
we apply the same principles you could

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,140
send gia chasin but in this Tocqueville

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,690
focus on matte box vector tell

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,460
specification and so now we cut vector

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,740
data into these squares and now we have

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,080
even more advantages have much better

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,600
user experience because for example we

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,360
can show you the language in other

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,050
labels in your language we could adapt

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,930
it to a day-night mode and you can style

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,670
on the client so you could even use of

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,860
defined styles if you like a color more

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,170
and there are even smaller and tiles so

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,840
you need less data but the biggest thing

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,020
that is often overlooked is I can create

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,080
vector tiles just once I can create one

00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,200
set like for creating nice base maps or

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,830
I know from open sea map they create a

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,630
vector tile layer just for these

00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,310
specific things or perhaps for hot you

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,110
can create a vector tile layer and

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,750
someone renders that once and then

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,000
everyone can use and style it and that

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,250
would be really nice if we go more in

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,650
this direction and we make use of this

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,420
fact so you want to create your own map

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,450
now so you need these vector tiles and

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,700
you need a style and this style is a

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,100
JSON document and I will be talking

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,650
about the Mac box GL style specification

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,020
so if these two things and then you need

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,989
a client to render them into an image

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,840
and one good example here that works

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:42,150
very now on all platforms is my box GL

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,550
but open layers 3 has support for it as

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,410
well so you really have the vector data

00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,660
and the style description that looks

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,660
like this for example here buildings

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,190
gifting this color gray color and then

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,670
the renderer turns them into a nice

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,500
image on your device

00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:02,100
ok need vector tools where can I get

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,220
them so there are vector tile services

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,739
map box is one of the biggest ones but

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,350
so you need two paper map view later on

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,930
and actually while the processes are

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,930
open the data is not the vector tiles

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,760
and I think from OpenStreetMap vector

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,410
tiles should be OD BL as well you should

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,840
be able to download and have them

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,160
yourself and your vendor locked in if a

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,910
company goes out of business

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,010
what do you do if your lock

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,350
their ecosystem you need an access key

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,240
and if you want to have offline use

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,060
cases or use it in your company in

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,180
firewall in a plane which reviews cases

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,040
you can't do that so that's why

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,410
recommend so the hard part about

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,180
creating your map is the vector tiles so

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,900
we do that for you we took the time and

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,790
we created a nice base layer for

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,100
creating maps and we pre-rendered the

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:55,430
entire planet for you so we calculated

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,430
360 million tiles did them once and now

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,490
you can have a USB stick with 55

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,650
gigabytes and you have the entire vector

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,720
date of the planet you can plug that in

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,940
and you have the entire planet and go

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,360
zoom in everywhere and you have the data

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,040
there and the vector tiles are open

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,550
source you can download them there on

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,050
their OD BL the workflow is open source

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,940
so do what you want and you have no

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,430
vendor lock-in if we go out of business

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,870
or we no longer want to do something

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,090
with this project you have the tiles you

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,820
have everything you can host as yourself

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,380
build up your own business and you can

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,370
do it offline you could make offline

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,570
desktop applications mobile applications

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,710
so let me show you how that actually

00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:42,980
looks like so we have our website here

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,990
there are some two vector tiles and we

00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,780
try to have great content with

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,550
documentation with videos but the

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,980
simplest way to get started is if you go

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,800
on maps there we have a collection of

00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,840
some free map styles and you could

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,180
choose one and then you have the HTML

00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:07,990
here just copy that yeah that works and

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:10,630
now I will create an HTML file some

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,760
simple HTML file and here we reference

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:16,640
this style and it is using a CDN so

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,419
using our servers good that's all we

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,700
need we open the map and here we have it

00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:25,100
our own map you can now use it in your

00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,100
website with a different style and you

00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,570
have your own map ok but now I want the

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,000
tiles back to Charles we want to host

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:36,940
them ourselves and we perhaps want to

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,940
adapt the style a bit so next step

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,820
we need to download the vector tiles and

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,360
like maps on you can download entire

00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,920
planet

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:53,130
54 geeks you can download 22 200

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,490
countries and 600 cities and of course

00:06:53,130 --> 00:07:00,720
we're going to do it with Brussels and

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:05,790
already downloaded it but you can see

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,710
how fast that goes and so we have this

00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,790
vector tiles now we need to surf them

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:13,710
let me delete that and there is a small

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,920
tile server we can install with note

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:20,010
that should work on all platforms of the

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,510
virtual light so I'm not going to do the

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:25,260
installation but it should work as well

00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:27,150
and I can run that now and just pass in

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,460
this a Beatles file and it's just in a

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:32,880
sequel Lite database with all the tiles

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,310
in it so process Belgium it's running

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:41,220
and port 8080

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:46,680
let me find the mouse cursor so so port

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:49,080
8080 so and we can go on the extra view

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,840
and we see this is the actual vector

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,750
data of bristles so we can hover over it

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,140
and we see the attributes and yeah we

00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:01,770
have the polygons the lines and now we

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,440
can style that and even if you don't

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,729
want to go the vector tile route there's

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,700
more advanced version called tiles our

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:12,210
GL which can even serve roster tiles

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,430
from the same server and there's this

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,640
tile choice in URL which contains all

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,830
the information we so going back to that

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,919
later now I have two vector tiles want

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:25,530
to create our custom style and usually

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,970
you would use map box 2d for this but

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,580
I've been working on our own style

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:33,000
editor so we don't have to use cloud

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:38,539
based software and I'm going to reset

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,539
the style here okay

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:50,589
so let's do live debugging okay

00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:57,160
self-healing and let's zoom into

00:08:50,589 --> 00:09:00,040
Brussels and that's the same style and

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:04,649
now we want to switch from our CDN in

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:08,259
sources to our self-hosted vector charts

00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:10,540
so copy design point we paste it that's

00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:13,720
it we switched we're now in our own

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:17,649
vector tools and let's change a bit the

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,509
styles here so I'm not quite done yet

00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:22,649
with the editor but I can show you how

00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:26,379
to style a bit around on the buildings

00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:33,819
let's make them different gray give them

00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:36,399
a black outline color yeah we can toggle

00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:38,100
the visibility we can remove something

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:45,579
if we don't want it

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:47,829
let's style the parks as well yeah so so

00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:49,870
if you know hex code colors by heart but

00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:56,709
I want to build this color picker here

00:09:49,870 --> 00:10:00,129
as well and okay let's style yeah that's

00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:01,839
enough as people and I can save it and

00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:04,389
you see that's actually running locally

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,759
my style editor so I don't want you to

00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:10,209
have to use a source provider you can

00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:14,529
run that yourself and now we are going

00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:17,019
to download the style this JSON file so

00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:23,079
and I'm going to copy it over to the

00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:28,990
directory here so just copy the file

00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:33,730
over and give it a nice name southern

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:36,369
style so we can take a look at it and

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,379
you see actually it looks like that and

00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:40,990
you could edit that by hand but why

00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:42,699
would you if you have an editor and for

00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,559
I want to enable people who don't want

00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:49,600
to do this just create their own Maps as

00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:52,060
well and here in sources you see we

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,660
reference our local server

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:59,290
so we're completely independent now and

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,480
now on our HTML page previously we are

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:07,420
going to replace the style here from the

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:10,540
CDN with our own JSON file so switch to

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:16,170
our own style with our own server and

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:18,780
let me set up a small HTTP server port

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:22,630
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:24,520
so everything can fail now good we're

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,410
zoomed in too much now because we only

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:30,250
have turned all the data for Brussels

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:32,260
and I have some data the opportun levels

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:44,440
to make it look good so we can zoom into

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:46,690
Brussels so and here we have our style

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,890
from that we created previously running

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,900
our own style I wanna make the tell

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:53,100
server completely independent and that's

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:56,020
what I want to do with this project

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,020
so again if you just need a map you can

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,690
probably use the CDN copied HTML code of

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,220
a map someone designed and use that but

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,410
you can also serve your own vector tiles

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,530
you download them from the page for your

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:11,680
country or entire planet you run a tile

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:15,340
server and surf the tiles until you use

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,260
those tiles in your style and then you

00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,300
want to create a custom map style and

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:24,160
for that I created this new tool I put

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:25,600
Nick and you download a style and if you

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,250
don't want to start from scratch and

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,320
then you point point that style to

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,200
yourself as vector tiles and you can

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,020
tweak around in the future one to do for

00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,720
more complex base maps and so we can

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,220
create beautiful so if someone has a

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,280
talent for attic and create beautiful

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:46,810
Maps now without much technical

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:49,150
knowledge so and I don't want you to use

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,430
map books with your in the cloud if we

00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:55,150
are in our some universe so I'm building

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:58,990
a free alternative that you can run

00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:02,230
locally and so if you're a company that

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,970
is using map books GL you should really

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,279
think about doing a small pledge to my

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,050
Kickstarter campaign

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,269
to found that because that's a really

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,790
small investment for the price of a

00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:13,680
monthly subscription to matte box we can

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,230
create an open-source tool and I just

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,790
want to get started here and later give

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,129
this hour to the community completely

00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:24,899
open source we decide the features

00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:27,899
together that's the plan so come talk to

00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:31,170
with me afterwards if you have input or

00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,480
want to use something like this so and

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,420
not only can we do web maps we can also

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,759
do mobile apps using map map box native

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,949
SDK which are open source and these are

00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,980
just great you can use create iOS apps

00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:46,079
and rate or even desktop apps with QT

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,029
and the cool thing is because we they

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,860
can download the vector tools we could

00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:52,350
create an app that has the entire planet

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,749
offline if you have that much storage or

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:57,329
let's imagine you go to a city and then

00:13:54,749 --> 00:14:00,259
you downloads the city you are do you

00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:03,180
have it offline and we have a prototype

00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:04,589
app called us into vector Charles if you

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,990
search it in app and Play Store you can

00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:10,860
already feel a bit what you could build

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:12,889
as developer and we hope some great apps

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,689
will come up with this and use that and

00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:18,269
in the same spirit there is a similar

00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,649
project from the same University also

00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:23,339
built together with clock on tech where

00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:25,620
you can download queue name data so to

00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,389
cast your data so you can just search

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,040
for Brussels and you immediately get the

00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:30,959
bounding box where that is and you can

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,089
build your own offline nominal team so

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,290
that's another key part for creating an

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:40,649
offline app offline search so to sum it

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:42,149
up we have the process and the web

00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:46,290
details on the website you can download

00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:49,470
the entire planet 54 gigs or 700 cities

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,509
220 countries the workflow to create

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,730
them is open and scalable so if you are

00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:57,540
creating workflow take a look there or

00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:00,000
talk with me and also the vector tiles

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:03,660
are under the same license as OSM ODB l

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,399
so you can use them and vector tiles we

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,350
try to keep them up to date with Wilson

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,790
currently we're lagging behind but it's

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,730
just because we don't have the servers

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,009
but we we could actually be like one day

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:18,029
up-to-date with OS M and have it always

00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:19,000
downloadable so thanks there's more

00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,470
information on the web

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,420
site and looking for questions and

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,450
please just ask there's no stupid

00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,030
question go to the github ask anything

00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,380
or hit me on Twitter or per email so I'm

00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,800
with the forward to talk with you

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,800
afterwards

00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:43,070
Trillian Thank You Lucas I see some

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,649
hands up already and remember it's Lucas

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,720
said if these speakers around go find

00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:51,980
them chat to them and they're asked

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:55,040
questions that we didn't let you ask the

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,839
great work um I noticed that the code

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,260
using still has a dependency on the map

00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:02,180
box gr library and is there any I mean

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,180
last time I looked there's no good

00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,940
plugin at all for the leaflet there's no

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,300
plugin for an Apple map kit that kind of

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,120
thing

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,279
is there any is anyone or are you

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,690
planning to work on a leaflet plugin so

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,940
that we don't have to scrapped lots and

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,839
lots of existing code you know simple

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,850
drawing and all kinds of other things

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,120
that based on the leaflet and have to

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:26,180
move our entire library over to jail or

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,520
something else so and I think you can

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,649
use netbooks chill as a layer under

00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,649
leaflet you can combine it that way or

00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:35,630
for example with a vector with tiles

00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:38,660
overkill you can serve roster tiles so

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,070
you can combine it that way or perhaps

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,800
not you perhaps you also talked about

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,630
styling leaflet maps in an editor like

00:16:42,800 --> 00:17:05,120
this I've also interests there perhaps

00:16:44,630 --> 00:17:07,939
we can talk about this later thanks

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,660
great work really great two questions a

00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:16,130
legal one and technical one technical do

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:19,429
you render stuff on the backend like can

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:22,579
you can you do roster with layers with

00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:26,089
like GL layers on the backend or do you

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:28,790
use native GL for that or you mean when

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:30,380
we don't answer ratio if you serve Rosso

00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:34,370
tile so talk we've paid the praetor

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:36,830
afterwards about this alright and the

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,840
legal question um when you create the

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,059
vector tiles what data structure do you

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,770
use because we heard from a box that

00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:47,210
they actually don't want community to

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:50,030
use their data structure ok the

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,330
licensing issue so we have an issue that

00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,169
is linked here

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:57,210
you can make up your own mind about

00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:59,220
licensing problems with netbooks I'm

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,750
obviously biased so if I say anything

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,659
that's my opinion I think you should

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:06,000
make your own but still I'm looking for

00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:07,980
compromise and we hope one to reach this

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,299
conference so sorry for this information

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:18,360
but I can't we can talk afterwards for

00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:22,220
your personal opinion that might be

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,220
something we need to ask Matt box later

00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:30,990
okay yeah there's some really good stuff

00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:35,639
what see is still the style an open

00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:38,730
standard oh is that the multiple styles

00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:40,740
specification but I can imagine that

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,960
this can be common standard so with an

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,370
open layers plug-in for example someone

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,120
is working on that to display that in

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,590
open layers and so I talked to several

00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,070
people and that's probably the best

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:55,799
thing we got to start standard that

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,630
doesn't suck okay

00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:59,279
just to let you know I am checking the

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,820
website if there's any questions from

00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:06,710
the live feed on the on the program page

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,600
for this talk and I look if you're quick

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:13,350
let me add I also think this is really

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,860
impressive as you move to the higher

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:20,039
zoom levels you are inevitably having to

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:26,669
lose some detail it's not your decision

00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:33,090
which features and so where we lose

00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:34,919
detail yeah so for example yeah we we

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,830
make our decisions where to lose what

00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,380
only here we display forests but you can

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,240
assume that at the most detailed level

00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,029
we still don't have everything in OSN

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,230
because not everything is relevant

00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:49,169
this style doesn't display it but

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,480
actually there's every boy every even

00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:55,559
house numbers we are pretty detailed

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:58,320
here and you can get quite forestalling

00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:00,360
and if you are missing a set like open

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,250
sea map has a lot of very special sea

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,590
specific things I don't understand if

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,950
you're a sailor and these things we

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,900
don't

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,720
in a Bayes Network search I'll set but

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:12,390
then you can create your own and

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,280
actually it's very easy to combine two

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,470
of these layers together and it's still

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,970
fast I hope that answers the question

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:24,960
but it's your decision what what is

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:27,720
being lost that's that's a decision

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,120
based on what's important to create a

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,870
base map in this case but I know there

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:36,270
are you can also display everything at

00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,330
zoom level eight like here if you're

00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,560
building population maps for example

00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,360
that yeah but it's a decision you have

00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,120
to make in order that is still smooth

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,990
because it's drawn on the client so if

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,850
you if it's of me or this chap set this

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,810
up ourselves on our own servers we

00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:59,790
configure that so the certain things in

00:20:54,810 --> 00:21:01,530
the data so we create the director tells

00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,140
for you because it's quite expensive to

00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:23,010
do that all right but do you render your

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:25,770
own you could do that yeah this is

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:29,340
technically really impressive one of the

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:32,070
things that I was so in my day job I do

00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:37,890
cartography from time to tell you so I'm

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:39,450
wondering where I guess what types of

00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,400
decisions if you had to had to make

00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,980
during the project and what if the hard

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,280
ones been and what if the easy ones been

00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,810
and what's your thought process been

00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:53,400
kind of coming at it from a cartographic

00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:55,020
perspective so labeling is the hard

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,670
problem because in Aversa you don't have

00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,490
all the information you sometimes have

00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,890
population data but population is for

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,950
example difficult to derive nice labels

00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:07,470
and so actually on this soon I was here

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,840
osm is no longer the perfect data source

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:12,150
you need to merge in natural earth data

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,070
sources to get a bit more channels

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,830
version that's for example interesting

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,410
you know Assam or an open street map you

00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,210
also don't have

00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:22,740
labels of the sea that this is the

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,410
Mediterranean you just have the point

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,930
which is nice for data purposes but for

00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:31,920
character graphic aspect you want a cool

00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:35,100
Lake line or and yeah also what is

00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:38,970
important if you have poised so kind of

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:45,200
interests here so you also need to do

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:45,200
some some ranking at what point sorry

00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:50,940
at what point I'm going to show which

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:54,780
shops and usually use the size of the

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:58,320
area of a shop and like police we say

00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:00,840
it's a bit more important yeah this but

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,320
I love chitchat we can go into detail or

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,820
I can take this all day yeah I think

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,500
we've got lots of times I think I might

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,710
just allow one more question and then

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:18,690
give you more lunch time after Maya do

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:21,450
we have one more question yeah I have

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:24,600
the impression that vector tiles you

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:28,830
could also do some routing offline is

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,970
that the case did you think about it I'm

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,390
not sure where the map box has a

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:35,220
prototype for routing but I think for

00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,730
that it's really not the most suitable

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:42,030
you want your own node data there there

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,980
is a interesting thing QA tiles they're

00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:46,170
called which are also used by their own

00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,090
analytics to do some kind of analytics

00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:55,490
but they're not perfect for routing I

00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:55,490
