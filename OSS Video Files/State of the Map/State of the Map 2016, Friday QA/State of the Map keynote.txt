Hey, Good morning everybody.

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,140
Erm, I have the pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker Ambassador Alan Mustard.

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,990
Erm, I wanted to share how I was introduced to the ambassador, last year I was serving

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,019
in the State Department as a fellow in the Humanitarian Information Unit on a project

00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,789
called Map Give and we have an e-mail address, which is on

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,519
the web and recieve all sorts of random enquiries about our project and about what we do,

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,840
and one week we received an e-mail from Ambassador Alan Mustard.

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,609
And, I was only at the state department for 1 year

00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:47,539
but even in that one year I realised how unusual and extraordinary, erm that in a place

00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,589
which is very concerned with protocol and process, to directly

00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:59,359
hear from an ambassador about our little project and our little office - which of course is

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,449
very important to all of us but within a big organisation like the State Department and

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:10,480
all the embassies around the world, we were very much hoping to spread the word on OpenStreetMap

00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,560
to those venues - it was very exciting to hear from the ambassador

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,750
asking about imagery for Ashgabat, for the capital, which was very out of date.

00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:28,600
This was just wonderful to have that kind of informal connection which I think so exemplifies

00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,600
what OpenStreetMap is about - we just get directly to it and do it.

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,430
So the ambassador is currently serving as ambassador to Turkmenistan for the United

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,500
States.

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,640
His previously served as distinction as the senior most foreign service officer for the

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,580
US department of Agriculture and New Delia, Mexico City, and Moscow, and also serves as

00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,760
an ambassador for OpenStreetMap in his current role so

00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:06,160
my pleasure, please welcome Ambassador Mustard.

00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,720
(applause)

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,270
I'm not known as a juggler, but I'm going to be juggling a couple of things here.

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,920
I have the microphone to juggle, I have my speaker's notes here, and I have this clicker.

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:29,520
So if I drop anything, please forgive me.

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
It's on, yeah.

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,720
Okay, Erm, that's a little blurry.

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,910
Can we get that a little bit sharper?

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,850
No way?

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,850
Okay.

00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,760
Thanks Erm,

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,390
Normally when ambassadors are introduced, you get this lengthy introduction into all

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,630
the awards they've gotten and the magnificent work they've done in various places.

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,990
And I knew this was going to be a tough audience, so I'm not going to give you any of that kind

00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,990
of nonsense.

00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:59,020
Erm, I'll tell you this I first started using OpenStreetMap in 2011

00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:05,210
as a passive user because I moved to New Delhi, and New Delhi is a city that is very difficult

00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,610
to get around and I found that OpenStreetMap was a big help.

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,240
Er, 2014 came and rolled around, and Iactually began contributing to OpenStreetMap because

00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Iwas learning enough about New Delhi I felt confident that I could add information to

00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,010
OpenStreetMap without embarrassing myself.

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,450
Well then I got this job moving to Ashkabat

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:31,330
and erm, I took a very deep interest in OpenStreetMap for one major reason, and that is

00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,860
that I am directionally challenged.

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:39,660
I'm one of those guys who gets lost, literally in his own house.

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,200
Sometimes, when I've moved to a new place and it's a house.

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,480
And as I ran around Bosnia, about 20 years ago

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,010
I didn't have GPS in those days, we had these maps.

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,410
Made out of parachute silk.

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,040
And this is, this was, the state of the map years ago in

00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,069
Europe.

00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,880
Parachute silk maps provided by the US military.

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,870
Er, we're a little bit better now.

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,380
But I got to Ashgabat, and I'd been there about two weeks

00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,740
my secretary came to me in frustration she said I got a phone call last night from

00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,220
my daughter.

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,719
She wanted me to come pick her up.

00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:23,150
I said, where are you. and my daughter said, I'm in a white building,

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,870
three blocks down from a street corner with a fountain on it.

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,960
That describes approximately 50% of the housing in Ashgabat city.

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,770
Er, and she spent two hours looking for her daughter, talking to her on the cell phone

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,409
until she finally, the daughter said "I see you, I see you, stop.

00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,729
I'll come to you."

00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:46,259
So, I began mapping.

00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,789
And enlisted my wife to go with me.

00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,719
We began, and we ran into some challenges.

00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:54,650
One of them was that there are very few street signs in Ashgabat.

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,650
No telephone book.

00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,490
The last telephone book was published in 1993.

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,749
And we started saying, where do you find the grocery stores, where do you find pharmacies,

00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:07,159
hotels, markets, hospitals, the other embassies, government offices.

00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:12,490
But the big impetus was where are the gas stations.

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,090
There are only about a dozen and a half gas stations in a city of a million.

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,339
I was down to fumes before I found one, and at that point I said

00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:27,770
"we have got to do something" and the something of course was OpenStreetMap.

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:35,059
Now, this was the state of the map when I arrived in January 2015.

00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:40,309
er, there were two maps available on the economy if you could find them

00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:46,499
This one was the Sofitel Map done by Sofitel when it was running one of the hotels in Ashgabat.

00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:49,479
You notice the streets are labelled with 4 digit numbers.

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:54,270
This is because when President Niyazov was president he heard from somebody that in the

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,139
United States streets are numbered.

00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,639
And he said, that's a great idea we're going to do the same thing.

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,009
(audience laughter) So here you have street 2019, up here you

00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:13,460
have street 2033, down here you have street 2056/3.

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,039
This was not terribly helpful.

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,490
Then in 2014, the Ministry of Defence published a tourist map.

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,039
Don't ask me why.

00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:26,999
Erm, and this had a couple of problems.

00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,190
This is the same section of town.

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,430
You can see they have put on the street names, but they have written them in English.

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:42,529
So you have Magtymguly Avenue, you have basically pigeon-ised versions of the names, of the

00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:43,529
streets.

00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,699
So you can take this map, and you really have difficulty navigating.

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,849
plus with there are no street signs how do you find your way around?

00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:58,169
the other problem with this map is that it was printed in a total of 300 copies

00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:02,529
in a city of 1 million erm, so

00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:08,289
I started work on OpenStreetMap in Ashgabat and after I'd been working on it for about

00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:13,279
a month, month and a half I had a revelation

00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,669
I'm the ambassador! these people work for me

00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:21,190
(audience laughter) I can tell them to do things

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,569
and they have to it because I'm the ambassador and I had a motor pool with drivers

00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:31,309
who had been driving in Ashgabat for over 20 years

00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:33,210
so I went to them and I said

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,139
could you please help contribute to this effort

00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:38,300
and they said sure, we'll be happy to do that but on one condition

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,520
I said, what's that? you have to buy us GPSes so we can navigate

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,509
too so I did

00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,419
erm, now they went to work helping me with mapping

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,590
and we discovered that we had some challenges

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,939
and I want to walk you through the 5 major challenges

00:07:54,939 --> 00:08:00,179
that we faced in Ashgabat First is, that Ashgabat is changing

00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:06,009
very dramatically, and very rapidly er, they're putting $5 billion into

00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:11,589
an olympic village that will be used a year from now for the 5th Asian Indoor Martial

00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:15,210
Arts Games They're putting a billion dollars into renovating

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,800
existing streets This is a huge clover-leaf that went into

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,599
operation about 6 months ago enormous amount of concrete being poured for

00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:31,300
overpasses, clover-leaves, traffic circles 60km of new streets, expansion of existing

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,060
streets plus, er, over here I've got this

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,950
this is a model of the new expanded airport that was just commissioned on the 17th of

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,400
this month 20.3 billion dollars to expand the airport

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,920
Erm, and I actually used this photograph by the way

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,600
I did a perspective correction on this and used this to draw the new OpenStreetMap version

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,220
of the airport go take a look at it

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,480
one of the interesting things about this airport is that this is the new passenger terminal

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,130
and this is the president's VIP terminal that he uses

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:09,000
they're both done in the shape of falcons so if you look at OpenStreetMap and you look

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,970
down and say Mustard's crazy, he drew birds on the airport

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,019
No, I'm not crazy, that's what's actually there

00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:18,050
(audience laughter) Erm,

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,899
5 billion dollars on new housing many of the old streets are simply disappearing

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,430
because they have been bulldozed to a single family dwelling, lots have been demolished

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,060
and replaced with high-rise buildings like this

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,770
these are all white-marble faced high-rise buildings

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:39,899
er, brand new paved streets total cost of all what you see going on in

00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,300
Ashgabat today is a minimum of 14.3 billion dollars being spent over approximately 3 years

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,529
er, now the real bad news is they've got all these

00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:52,300
new streets and most of them don't have signs

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,329
because having a street sign on the street-side of a building is considered unsightly, so

00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:03,610
if there is a street sign on a major thoroughfare, it's on the back side of the building

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,690
maybe there is a number on the street-side but even that's not guaranteed

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:14,360
and this makes GPSes very very useful Now here's some examples if you do see street

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,670
signs this is challenge number 2

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:23,900
signage erm, up here you have a sign that has a 4

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:31,560
digit number on it that's almost legible, 2015 street, over here 2054 street

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,610
here's a street that's completely obliterated, they recycled an old street sign, turned it

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:41,250
upside down, painted a new name on it, and then you can see the paint kind of came off

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,779
We can see the house number over here 6/2 but you can't see what street it's on

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:50,870
er, down here the home owner painted over the street sign

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,959
erm, and I took the photograph anyway just out of curiosity

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,870
these 4 here with the red line around them these are street signs on the street I live

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,790
on so up here we have Russian-written Cyrillic

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,589
here we have (name), also in Russian with Cyrillic

00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:20,980
here we have Turkmen Andizan kocesi, in Cyrillic, here we have (name) written with Latin letters,

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,839
and here we have the 4 digit number 2054 Okay

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,420
There's just one problem that's not the name of the street anymore

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,629
(audience laughter) this street is no longer 2054, it's no longer

00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:41,329
(name), it's now (name), which I found out from the

00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:43,430
major's office when they informed me the name of your street

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:51,740
has changed, but they haven't bothered to put any signs up yet

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,350
some people in Ashgabat take matters into their own hands put up their own street signs

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:02,660
so up here we have another example, this is nice

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:11,110
Kazandzikskly Pr, this is written in Russian but in Latin letters, so you now have all

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,040
4 variants er, this guy just painted it on his garage

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,730
door this guy painted it on the side of his house

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:23,629
in letters about 2 feet high this guy, put it on the roof line of his house

00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:26,081
and I missed it driving by, my wife pointed it

00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:28,040
out so we had to stop, so I could photograph it

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:35,320
cause it's sitting up on the roof it says: this house was built in 1955, er,

00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,350
(name), this is soviet falcon street, and by the way, that's no longer the name

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,620
of the street either, er, it's been changed it's now (name)

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,500
but you have to be alert for you can miss the street signs

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,060
now the other thing of course, is, I mentioned there's a de-Russian-ification underway, er

00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,839
the government is removing Russian names and putting in new names

00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:07,310
(name) For The City of Moscow, is now (name) which means 10 years of prosperity

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:19,230
(name) is now Independence Avenue but there's one problem with this

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,930
nobody has told the taxi drivers so if you get, you stop a taxi

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,160
and tell the driver, I need to go to (name) number 25

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,400
he'll look you and say: there's no such street, what are you talking about?

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,500
and you say: no, no, no, I need to go to (name), and you show him on the map and he can't read

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,800
the map and he just stares at it

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,200
so you have to know both streets and this is where OSM

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,749
comes in handy because we can database all these names

00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:49,870
they're all in there you can pull it up you can tell him: okay, don't take me to (name),

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:56,180
I've changed my mind, take me to (name) he says: okay, fine

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,550
(audience laughter) now another problem we have here with street

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:08,200
names is if you look here This is Axady kocsi which used to be (name),

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:14,060
that's a hard enough problem to know because everybody calls it (name) but it's now (name)

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:21,050
Azadee was a poet, and he had a first name first name was Devlet Mehmed, some of the

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:26,269
street names say Devlet Mehmed Azadee others say Azadee

00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:34,660
the entry in OSM is Devlet Mehmed Azadee when that is transferred to your garmin GPS

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,839
in your car you have to know what Azadee's first name

00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,759
was because Garmin GPSes will not search on strings

00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,519
on street names, they will search on the first entry

00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,519
and this is a problem because if we then go to some of the other

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,620
streets up here like Aba Annayew

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,730
you have to know that Annayew's first name was Aba

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:07,540
or if you go to Abasancylyk, nobody calls it 10yyl Abasancylyk, 10 years of prosperity,

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,959
we would probably call it Prosperity Avenue in the United States

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,899
you go here and you say okay, Abasancylyk if you search on Abasancylyk you find it in

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:21,800
your Garmin GPS, you have to know it starts with the number 10

00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,990
now there is some progress when my wife and I started mapping Ashgabat

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,959
in about March of 2015

00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:36,420
there were a total of about a dozen streets in OSM Ashgabat that had names

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,559
we're now up to about 80% at least, maybe close to 90% of the streets have been named

00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:50,300
so there is hope now another challenge

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:56,420
you all know the song "A Horse With No Name" well Ashgabat we have the street with no name

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:07,240
most of the city is divided into districts and each building is numbered uniquely

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:16,329
according to what district it's in, but the streets do not have names

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:19,970
so if I wanted to find this building, I have to know

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:27,360
what district it is in that's a problem again with the Garmin GPS

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,069
because if you punch in, try to punch in this address

00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:35,499
you can't find it and if anybody out there, if any of you programmers

00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:38,730
out there have a solution to this problem, I am all ears

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,699
erm, because needing to navigate with a GPS in a city where the streets don't have names

00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:48,670
is a real headache so, again maybe in one of the Birds of a Feather

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,279
sessions we can talk about this or you can come up to me afterwards and say how we do

00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,380
this Challenge number 4

00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,339
imagery just can't keep up, as I said they're spending 14.3 billion dollars over 3 years

00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,360
to change the city and the imagery can't keep up

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,580
the Bing imagery is about 3, 3 and half years out of date

00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:15,490
you can see here, that this street used to be curved, it is now straight

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:22,030
these buildings are completely gone erm, you've got new streets that have been

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,620
punched in and you say, okay, well that's fine, we've

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,170
got some new imagery, er Mapbox has provided some new imagery

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:35,960
which was a big help and then the Humanitarian Information Unit

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,920
of the Department of State from the Office of Geography has provided some even more recent

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,640
imagery that's been an enormous help it's US government license and therefore it's

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:53,000
freely used by anybody and I have put up the URL for that so people can find it easily

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,760
and that comes, by the way, through the Map Give initiative that was mentioned before

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,550
that's been a huge help but it hasn't solved everything

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:07,400
because we have a bunch of newbies in Ashgabat who have discovered OpenStreetMap

00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,500
they come in, they use the Bing imagery and they say

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,360
oh my goodness, look at this, this guy drew the street straight and it's supposed to be

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,580
curved (audience laughter)

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,670
so they, correct my errors, except they're not errors

00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,640
and sometimes I had a little war going on with a young lady who was working for the

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,250
major's office who kept drawing back buildings that had been demolished as part of the city

00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:38,830
renovation and this building in particular if you look at this one here

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,560
this does not appear in the Bing image, you can see

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,690
over here, I kept having to redraw this, cause she kept tearing it down, and rebuilding this

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,040
building, and I finally got through to her and said

00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:57,670
you have to stop doing this, that building exists this one exists no longer does, and

00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,250
erm, here I want to thank the OSM Working Group

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,720
by the way and two people in particular, Serge Wroclawski and Frederick Ramm who were very

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,110
helpful to me in corralling some of the people who were, not engaged in vandalism as much,

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:20,690
they just really didn't know what they were doing and they helped me to educate them

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,890
Challenge number 5, this is the big one the cultural clash, these are all things that

00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,140
people have communicated to me when I have tried to communicate with them about what

00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:38,660
they're doing to the map "Why are you putting house numbers in the

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:45,700
name field of a building which is specifically discouraged by the OSM guidelines" and the

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:53,840
answer I got back was "We need it for ourselves" okay, erm, another guy was changing all of

00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:02,030
the streets from kocesi which is the Turkmen word for street to kreet and I went back said

00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:08,530
you can't do this, and he said but my GPS pronounces kocesi wrong,

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:13,590
I want it to say stree-t. and okay, well you can't do that

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,820
it's, it's, you're not supposed to do that and "Why am I being blocked?" this was the

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:24,030
one after Frederick Ramm blocked one person who was really screwing some things up pretty

00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,210
badly and she came back to me and said "Why am I being blocked?"

00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,710
and I had to explain her why she was being blocked

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,060
and the bottom line here, is that this is really a result of two factors

00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:42,190
first, the Turkmen were nomads until about 100 years ago

00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:49,390
and they, they had sheep flocks that were out on open pasture, they were common pastures,

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:54,330
nobody owned the pastures, it was just the open land in the oasis areas

00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:02,860
so, the idea of private property is something that is relatively new to the Turkmen mentality

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,310
the second thing is that the Turkmen were under Soviet rule for 70 years and I know

00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:12,300
there are some folks here who come from the Eastern side of Europe and you understand

00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,180
very well what that did to people's attitudes towards public property.

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:23,150
erm, so under communism, the national government owned and controlled pretty much everything

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:30,900
but your personal possessions and that meant it was possible to appropriate or misappropriate

00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,720
anything that was considered to be more or less a public good

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:42,430
so the idea a public good comes with rules, that comes with guidelines, that comes with

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,120
some sort of restrictions on how it can be used, is a foreign concept

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,800
and this has been a problem trying to get this point across

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,140
to some of the mappers in Turkmenistan so again, I thank the OSM Working Group for

00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,260
it's patience and for it's enormous amount of help in trying

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:06,780
to keep this project alive in Turkmenistan so all of these headaches, you put them together

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:13,040
and it's caused me occasionally go pour a glass of wine and ask myself one question

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,820
why am I doing this? why am I beating my head against the wall,

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,790
is it worth the effort?

00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:24,380
why do I take my wife out on evenings and weekends to collect GPS traces and to collect

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,400
house numbers and things like that for gosh sake, I'm an American ambassador,

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:35,790
don't I have better things to do with my time than going out collecting house numbers?

00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:45,370
so anyway, I decide to sit down and make a list of the reasons that it's worthwhile

00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:50,170
Payoff number 1 it's the best map of Ashgabat available anywhere

00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:58,580
erm, and Igor Brejc has his Maperitive program which I use absolutely shamelessly and very

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:07,630
heavily to produce a street map of - and this is just, you can see here, this is what the

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:13,590
full size one looks like, this is an except, the full size one is about a metre and a half

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,660
tall by about a metre and half to two metres wide depending on how much of the suburbs

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,570
I include in it and believe it or not, the motor pool chauffeurs

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,900
now want a copy in their driver's shack for them to refer to, they have realised the value

00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,510
of having a map of this city that they can use to teach themselves to navigate places

00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:37,780
they don't know, it includes all the gas stations, hotels, embassies, hospitals, and lots and

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:43,130
lots of building numbers now, in addition to the general day-to-day

00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:50,410
usefulness of this map, Ashgabat is located in a category 4 systemic zone

00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:56,260
the last earthquake that they had was in 1948, the entire city was levelled, and 3 buildings

00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,860
survived, and approximately half the population was killed

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:06,230
last year, there were mms 7.5 earthquakes in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan, just

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,100
a couple of hundred miles away from Ashgabat, so we're in a systemic zone, the big one could

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:17,600
hit at any time, it could devastate the city in the event of a disaster having a map like

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:30,320
this is going to be absolutely invaluable the second big payoff, it's the only offline

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:38,260
GPS map that's available for Turkmenistan nobody else has one, Apple by the way, the

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:45,150
Apple map of Turkmenistan is the OSM map they're using our data,

00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:52,160
Maps With Me on iPhone and Android, lambert's GPS map downloadable to the Garmin, and of

00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,950
course Poket Earth on the iPhone, I use them all

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:03,000
and a big thank you Lambertus and the other developers, you have a real fan club in Ashgabat,

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,510
I have to thank you for that I think when Apple maps started using our

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,810
data that was big stuff Payoff 3, the only street atlases available,

00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:21,350
you can use Field Papers, or you can use one of Igor's Mapertive scripts - the Walking

00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:27,880
Papers script to generate multi-page street atlases that you can carry with you in your

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,240
car and we print these, we have them in our cars,

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:40,760
in case of emergency Payoff number 4, community outreach

00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,920
I've done 2 events at our Information Resource Centre

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,560
with local residents, asking them to start contributing street names, building numbers,

00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,590
identifying businesses, and other points of interest

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:59,960
the Ashgabat map in the last year has become extremely rich compared to what it was before,

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,040
basically because we have done this community outreach and have

00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:09,990
gotten people involved my 2 master classes each drew about 40 people

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:16,490
we sat them down, some of them on the spot at internet clients and put them to work and

00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:22,890
this has been great, we've also presented 2 Garmin GPSes to the Red Crescent Society

00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,600
for use in their ambulances and they're testing them, we also gave them a copy of the wall

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,400
map, so we're also contributing to the general

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:38,710
population of Ashgabat the Asian Games will be held a year from now,

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:45,410
and are expected to bring in 8,000 athletes, 1,500 coaches and trainers, and 1,000 journalists

00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,870
and there's a developer putting together a smart phone app for it, he decided to use

00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:55,370
the OSM data after comparing the OSM data to Google Maps and realising that the OSM

00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,840
database is richer than the Google Maps database and I thought that was a real coo

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:06,130
but the next payoff payoff number 6 is the most important one

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,090
of all I can find gas stations now

00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:14,320
(audience laughter) er, I can find gas stations and not just in

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,020
Ashgabat, because I have a motor pool and they drive out into the countryside, go to

00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,970
other cities, they map the gas stations because they've discovered that it's really valuable

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,330
to know where the gas stations are, especially in a city where you don't live and you don't

00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:33,880
know as well so now if I run out of gas, it's my own fault

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,580
so in short, yes it's worth the effort, and that's why I encourage all of you to keep

00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,760
on mapping and to volunteer for Map Give, pitch in with the humanitarian assistance

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,670
when disasters strikes and your skills can help those in need

00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:53,880
I hope you will engage Map Give's efforts, through the public affairs section of whatever

00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,000
US embassy is closest to you, and to teach open mapping so that more people can, can

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,350
er, can contribute and, I'll close with this image

00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:12,920
of a clover-leaf intersection that was commissioned about 6 months ago, and tell you all thank

00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,090
you very much for everything that you do for the mapping community and for the world at

00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:18,860
