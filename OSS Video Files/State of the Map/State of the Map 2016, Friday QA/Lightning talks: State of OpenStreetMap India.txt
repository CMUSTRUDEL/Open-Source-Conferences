hello my name is predict namaste as we

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,780
say in India and this is my first SOT am

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,170
very pumped up to be here I'm going to

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,700
just share what is happening in India we

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,750
are country of like more than a billion

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,810
people but that is not well reflected in

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,619
the terms of the community that we have

00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,660
but there is a lot of thing that's

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,189
happening there bit of the hood and I'm

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,179
just going to emphasize on what's

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:32,099
happening right now so yeah we are

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,829
growing as

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,390
osm community as you can see like

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,120
there's a lot of things happening right

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,879
now big cities obviously the target

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,149
where most of the mappings is happening

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,010
plus there are few users and and there

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,079
are more users coming that are

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,910
interested in wisdom that gives them the

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,219
ability to map

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,890
define places which currently like right

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,829
now most of the user base and the map

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,320
data is totally like dependent on Google

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,989
but with the help of like osm a lot of

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,640
people are now doing amazing work

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,960
showing what what's happening around

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,420
their cities what is happening around

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,659
their their regions how stuff are

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,119
growing how the cities are growing how

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,180
the development is causing the

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:22,200
plantation the tree covers the adverse

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:26,130
effect of like on things like leaks all

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,600
of these so there's a lot of users the

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,220
main driving factor is language because

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,900
English is not our first language as

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,640
well as Hindi is not spoken throughout

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,100
the country so there's a lot of emphasis

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,710
on the regional languages and that that

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,020
that gets reflected in a lot of like in

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,780
a lot of areas where you see regional

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,270
languages people predominantly are like

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,700
important and when you want to create

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,170
maps that is used by a specific city

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,360
that is you that can be used by a

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,210
specific region you want them to be in

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,490
the language that people Candide this is

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,560
Chennai and the language that you can

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,619
see in Tamil because that the most

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,869
common spoken language there and this is

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,360
important for the people who live in the

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,750
city and they don't know about English

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,880
or they don't know about

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,250
so this this these kind of maps are like

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,190
become important for them so there's a

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,750
lot of like mapping going on which is

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,940
which is people adding the names in

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,650
their local language you can see Canada

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,050
is one of the one of the most prominent

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,030
language in Indian subcontinent anywhere

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,490
in the world like you always find these

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:35,470
people adding tags and making a bigger

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:38,050
map of Canada throughout the world this

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,640
is my hometown I've been the only map

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,470
around there I've tried to contact it a

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,650
few people who were hit-and-run mappers

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,900
they they never contact it back I just I

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,850
did two things and decayed back but

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,710
something strange happened in the middle

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,020
of 2016

00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:56,320
I found out and II found out actually as

00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,590
as some community and and the data team

00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,560
at my box that there's a lot of building

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,170
in building a mapping happening around

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,730
the whole country and this is one of the

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,960
this is one of the user of OSM they are

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,800
thinking and right now building the

00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:19,870
capacity to use osm as part of as part

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,980
of the address infrastructure so they

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,810
have been adding buildings throughout

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,470
the country that can help them identify

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,910
these places so you can see like they

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,120
have added a lot of buildings and as

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:34,330
with every new team there's a lot of

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,540
there's a lot of like there's a lot of

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,010
like common mistakes like overlapping of

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,400
things overlapping of their own edge

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,050
it's sometimes like oh well that like

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,060
sometimes they're just common errors

00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,120
that you can see things not aligning

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,209
with the MiG we try to help them we made

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,300
sure that they know how SM works

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,770
they know how the community works they

00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,010
know what are the tools available right

00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,730
now

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:04,060
like tasking manager like the basics of

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,340
chocen how can you how you can reduce

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,100
these numbers of Gong gadgets how you

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:13,030
can improve the map quickly how you can

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,790
edit fast all of these things there's a

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,410
lot of events happening also in India

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,660
the most focus is towards the youth

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,760
since these are the people who are more

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,520
interested in maps creating them using

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,280
them there was a um

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,039
a few months ago where people were

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,340
invited to use osm and like play with

00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:35,740
what is that label create something just

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,599
a lot of like random ideas and how they

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,550
can work together with different teams

00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:42,490
and just to build the community that's

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,919
one of the bigger part as one of the

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,400
part of out reaching to people we have

00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,319
always like tried to focus on

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,750
identifying universities and colleges

00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,240
where we can contact with the students

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,699
we can show them what is osm how they

00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,800
can contribute how they can use it and

00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,539
just like the basics of how how they can

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,139
be part of this OS and this going

00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:07,900
community this is a university in

00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:12,580
Karnataka and these are the students of

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:15,009
third year so we just like get get them

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,349
to like understand how ID works and like

00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:19,449
how easily they can add their their own

00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:21,400
address and later on like how they can

00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:26,770
use overpass to just find like whatever

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:29,289
they need government is important part

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:32,469
of osm when you want to outreach and

00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:34,270
there is still a large part of

00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:36,520
government that is not well connected to

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:40,509
the OSM community this is a good example

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,199
where the local administrator was was

00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:47,110
trying to help initiative where the

00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,810
ability the whether the people were

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,270
teaching local people how they can add

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,419
this stuff how can they they can use osm

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:58,690
maps so this was a this was kind of like

00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:02,560
a good point where we we had interaction

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:05,310
with the with the government that's it

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,310
any questions

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,710
thank you um understand there's some

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,960
legal prohibitions to Matt making in

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,460
India could you alright then if that's

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,230
true if you could expand on how that

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:41,670
affects there are some community in

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:44,700
India that is more law for draft that is

00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,340
not a do lighter it's more of in a phase

00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,890
where people are discussing about it

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,960
since like when it first came at his

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:54,420
came as something which was which was a

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,730
new most of the laws in India are like

00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,530
very old so they don't cover what

00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,050
exactly the technology is doing right

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,580
now and it's still the good thing is

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,960
like still right now it's in the phase

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,780
where people are discussing the

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,840
government also like is inviting people

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,720
for their for their voices on that so

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,520
right now we are in a good phase where

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,260
the good thing is like it's in the part

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,450
of like discussion like the government

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,730
is ready to her about people says what

00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:24,540
the concerning parties have to say about

00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,790
it so I'm not I'm not able to comment on

00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,040
it because it's not a law right now it's

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:32,070
still in a draft mode and like we do

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:37,850
need to discuss a lot around it to make

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,850
