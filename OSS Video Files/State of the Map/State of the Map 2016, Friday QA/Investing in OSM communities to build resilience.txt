The World Bank launched the Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) and has been engaging in community mapping projects since its inception in 2011. The aim is to bring stakeholders together to create data and tools to inform decision-making related to urban planning and disaster risk management. But itâ€™s equally important to develop a level of trust necessary for these efforts to become sustainable.

Illustrated with many examples, this talk will address the following questions by presenting core principles of engagement and best practices to design successful community mapping activities.

How can we use community mapping to increase resilience to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change?
What makes a community mapping project successful?
What are the strategies for engaging local stakeholders and creating cross-organization communities?
How can we measure sustainability of a local OpenStreetMap community?

hi everyone so on vvn the pile day I

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,929
come from the global facility for

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:14,070
disaster reduction in recovery from from

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:18,180
the World Bank in the called G FDR and

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:21,900
so there a GF dr like three kind of

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,500
activities one is g FDR is managing

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,830
funds for resilience and n for climate

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,349
adaptation another one is GF dr as a

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,020
world and globally does advocacy iran

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,690
committing approaches and best practices

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,559
around around around resilience and

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,910
disaster risk management and finally

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,950
there are teams technical teams are

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,700
provides technical assistance to other

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,930
or bank teams around various issue like

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,210
policies asters a methodology better use

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,710
of data innovation and so i'm part of

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,460
one of this team called innovation lab

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:04,110
where we use innovation to an open data

00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,110
22 in apply to the challenge of

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,610
resilience so basically we do that

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,220
through project called open data for

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,490
resonance initiative and this project

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,450
started in 2011 because we realized

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,700
there was a lot of wasted opportunities

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:24,150
there were data as our butt and were

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,280
lost somehow and sometime expensive data

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,740
there were also some time when you want

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,450
to assess risk in a country like look at

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,640
assets and where the other one area you

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,729
may realize that I doesn't exist so so

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,100
how do we kind of do better in all of

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,110
this data management in innovations

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,600
already open that up for resonance tries

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,530
to apply open data open source open

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,590
standard and open communities to really

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,649
empower local local government and

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,299
people locally to really be able to to

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,980
take these tools and data and be able to

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:04,800
bounce off in

00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:06,660
and be more resilient so here today I

00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,940
will talk a little bit how we use

00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,300
openstreetmap in in those project and

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,010
kind of how we try to to make

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:17,120
sustainable so I don't know if I think a

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:20,420
lot of you may have seen this before but

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,800
you might guess where it is this is a

00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:28,350
kathmandu Kathmandu Valley and here i

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,600
guess the gif doesn't work but that

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,540
still will make my point is that this is

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,730
before the earthquake in every 2015 and

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,590
you can see there's already a lot of

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,770
mappings that has been done you can see

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,290
big blob of light on the right which is

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,240
a kathmandu and then if the gift was

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,790
working you could see animated all the

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,610
roads coming in and covering larger area

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:54,480
so how did we get there to a kind of

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,250
this good local contribution and remote

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,360
contribution before the disaster and

00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,360
during the disaster

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:14,159
I think you really didn't like the gift

00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,240
well

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:44,470
and it's in Duchess's you could do it if

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:48,120
you were in French but ok I'll just

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,120
restart the presentation I think

00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:11,180
it's done I will wrong button so how did

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,730
we met how where the local and global

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,950
community able to do that during the

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,840
response because it was a local

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,660
organization called cosmin who lived

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,640
exact there was able to provide kind of

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,030
a area of interest that needed to me

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,610
matt was able to provide training to

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,710
locally around Oh to print maps or to

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,830
use data offline doing validation and

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:39,310
doing coordination and this thing

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:41,480
started because in 2012 it's known that

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,170
kathmandu in the Kathmandu Valley is a

00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,850
very seismically risky zone and so

00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,650
wanting to look at schools and

00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,020
resilience of school so needed a

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,660
database of school with all the

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,350
characteristic around the material roof

00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:00,350
type profile of the building and so we

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:04,220
needed the data to do that and so on a

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:07,580
normal project you really you my higher

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,320
consultant or a firm to go out and get

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,870
the data it's kind of a one-off

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,720
collection then the data comes back on

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,820
harddrive maybe another consulting

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,870
company will using to do the other Ling

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:24,340
and then sometime it still like shared

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:27,800
in some way but often it's not sure and

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:30,650
so instead of doing that we went and try

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,250
to use openstreetmap based on experience

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:36,290
from a t-post disaster but also from

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,630
Indonesia where openstreetmap was

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:42,080
starting to be used as a 3ds asta too

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,700
and really here by using openstreetmap

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,610
we can have a collaborative approach

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,010
where we go beyond the end product of

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,650
the data we be able to build a local

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:54,830
community build capacity will trust in

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:57,230
the data and and really all these things

00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,330
leaves be on our project and then can be

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,850
picked up by other projector by local

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,980
organization or local businesses in an

00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,100
all this connection that we start to

00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:09,120
make can also live beyond

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:12,190
given project or individual organization

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,430
so over the years and four or five years

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,620
we've been working now in about 20 to 30

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,290
country if we can't a regional project

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:27,990
not all on openstreetmap also on open

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:27,990
data policies on using GI software and

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,430
so from the expunge that experience we

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,130
were and from the experience of the

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:39,490
partners we've been working a lot with a

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:42,790
lot of people here like hot has been one

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:45,610
of the main main partner State

00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:49,810
Department and I can Red Cross US aid

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:52,030
and others and so here we wanted to kind

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,550
of take this lesson learn experience how

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,710
can we can we be more efficient at a

00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:00,070
diving successful project and build

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:10,030
sustainable capacity and community in

00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:14,820
the process now another book well i

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,820
guess i will use the other computer

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:14,699
actually already doing this for them I

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:18,530
then got him and said hey this is what

00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,530
we can do get on the tasking manager

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:39,779
going back okay so first we cannot

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,580
devote recently actually based a lot of

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,560
the experience kind of basic principle

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,020
of engagement which are a bit more eye

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,940
level because we don't do only

00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,290
openstreetmap but some of them might be

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,140
familiar with you like open by default

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:54,660
and accessible licensing documented data

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,089
open by default is because he might have

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,850
had this experience it's on the data is

00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:01,589
there if it was no agreement beforehand

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,650
it would be a lot harder to get it off

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:07,170
someone hard drive or some institutions

00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,450
if you didn't agree beforehand so it's

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,610
important to think about those at the

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,570
design of the project and another one is

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:18,000
also accessible it's when an example of

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,610
a PDF where you may have a multi-million

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,670
dollar data just as a PDF format which

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:27,150
is a bit frustrating and then we're open

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,490
stream app really really is shine is the

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,760
co-creation and local ownership of the

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,680
data so being able to build local

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,390
capacity will trust in the data and

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,640
really be local ownership of the data

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,380
over time and finally we interact with

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,900
many different type of users from the

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,940
scientist to to the local community so

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,889
we need to to package this information

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,629
in enthusing in different way

00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:53,160
and second this process we so that was

00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:55,379
about the data I now kind of about the

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,989
process which always try to engage the

00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,059
user communities to define the needs but

00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:03,089
also to engage them in developing the

00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:05,669
tools customizing the tools developing a

00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,350
partnership not necessary traditional

00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:09,509
partnership but between local osm

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,220
community with with a government

00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:13,529
institution with the University and so

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,749
on prioritizing I open source software

00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,179
like the OpenStreetMap community because

00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:19,739
it really empowers the community to with

00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:22,679
a low barrier of entry to use the data

00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:24,629
and then this is not kind of a quick fix

00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,639
it really change requires a change of

00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:29,999
mindset in a long-term engagement I

00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:32,999
think most of the places we've got six

00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:36,720
like good success after two or three

00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:39,779
years of working in a place and and so I

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,660
was kind of eye level principal and then

00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:44,339
we also developed a guide to kind of

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,980
consolidate more of a step-by-step

00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:50,699
approach or how we we design project and

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,799
this is really because we're just I'm

00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:55,529
full of people coming to the conference

00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,660
and meeting up in various places but

00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,970
really just at the walbank there is

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,739
10,000 people so we need to kind of get

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,689
the word out there and get the message

00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:06,480
out there you know the institution and

00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:08,730
other places and so is hot and other

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,029
partners that I mentioned before we try

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,410
to develop a guide on how we do that and

00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:15,989
now we actually put the guide also

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,790
recently on github so it's open to

00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:20,189
contribution and so Bernie licensed in

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:24,299
sacks we just called planning a mapping

00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:26,519
project with openstreetmap and so in

00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:28,709
this guide we this different part today

00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,110
I won't really go around the technical

00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:33,119
part of how you do the mapping I think a

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,519
lot of you know how to do the mapping or

00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:37,679
was it the most fun part I think but

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,149
we'll go a bit around the sustainability

00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:45,660
aspect in and in the project design so

00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:48,089
here is kind of how we broke it out kind

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,779
of a planning phase a preparation and

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:53,609
mapping and then in using it and so

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,379
first in the planning phase you really

00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:59,020
want to make sure you do something

00:11:55,379 --> 00:12:01,000
realistic assess your local partners you

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,060
size of the project and also we always

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,030
try to anchor it in in a in a larger

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,190
project we at the World Bank we working

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,650
with a workman project but really to

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,950
have a girl that's just not mapping for

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,270
the for the sake of of mapping and in

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,650
this process that partnerships are

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,230
really key and because as I mentioned

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,850
these are things that are kind of

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,710
staying longer than the project and also

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,990
at each stage of a project you might

00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:29,470
work with different people some people

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:31,630
might help you provide like staff or

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,690
workspace some people might provide like

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,760
scientific kind of experts and so this

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,340
different type of partners you can you

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,230
can look at so we work with

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:45,250
openstreetmap communities government

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:47,290
local universities and local osm

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,080
communities and scientific communities

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,940
so I go bit faster because with all

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,470
these incident i'm already at five

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:59,110
minutes so i just use a 2 example one so

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:02,050
the kathmandu example the idea was to to

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:04,240
have plans retrofit buildings and so get

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,340
data around those buildings and in sri

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,320
lanka where we worked in two river basin

00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,000
the idea was also to support risk

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,280
assessment and identification of

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,140
investment for climate resilience as

00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,630
well as supporting local disaster

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,280
management centers so in these two

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,890
countries with partners with a

00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,480
government agency many in sri lanka and

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,920
in kathmandu it's interesting too

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,140
because n set which is a really expert

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,510
organization in seismic risk was

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:36,730
involved in designing the data model in

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:39,130
the in the project and so in each of

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,930
those we had precise objective what kind

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,800
of attribute wanting to collect what

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:48,270
type of area and in and to really have a

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,010
goal set goal at the beginning and so

00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:54,040
here i will go not go over the execution

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:57,670
but it involved a lot of field papers

00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:00,910
that you can see stacks of them and now

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,170
it involves drones mobile app gps and a

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,900
lot of people from around the world

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:09,760
formal training and i think you you know

00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:11,680
that part so here to execute this we had

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,870
slightly different model actually

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,880
we worked with a local company and Robin

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,399
consultant and with the local government

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,500
local government made available one

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,240
staffer I mean area to work on the

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,520
project and so they were doing the data

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,190
collection and collaboration with the

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,220
team and in a catenary was not driven by

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:34,990
universities and volunteers supervised

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:38,170
by by the local team an N set and so we

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,670
had great success in Kathmandu we were

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:44,170
able to collect all the schools and

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:46,959
hospital the are on the map here in Sri

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,029
Lanka we did two-phase project and first

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,490
time we collected about 30,000 building

00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:53,740
all of them with characteristic so you

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,050
can start looking as a different kind of

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,850
a venir abilities of the building in the

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:00,550
structure and the second time we

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,529
collected about 100,000 building also

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,680
just working with local government in a

00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:08,110
local team and so this is just two

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,050
examples is many easier example farmers

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,950
and for motor organization with the like

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:18,130
MSF and American Red Cross and others

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:22,480
were also kind of following this

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:25,029
metallurgy okay and so then we're ready

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,420
trying to feed that in streamlines that

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:31,029
into into the processes of the design

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,360
project to really use the data to inform

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:37,300
this season and as I mentioned earlier

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,709
this is not the data project is one part

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,480
of it but I think the most important

00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:42,190
part of it is all these local

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,130
communities and local capacity that is

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:49,330
built during the process in all the

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:51,880
various countries and so I guess one of

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:54,700
the things the summary of the talk was

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,279
around sustainability of this community

00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,380
so when we do this kind of project they

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,290
might be attention between getting a

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,630
product and deliverable for project but

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,240
also the need to build a community in a

00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,490
sustainable f4 and so how do we do that

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,649
how do we take this opportunity of this

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,660
one project to build something that

00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:16,420
lasts longer and what kind of are the

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,060
best practices so these are kind of just

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,610
ideas

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:24,090
some to be further developed some that

00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:26,730
we through sorcery experience so first

00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,770
on an individual level I think a lot of

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:32,250
it a lot of the motivation comes around

00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:34,560
getting skills and learning and then we

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,140
have a lot of examples messing around

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,540
people getting then hired by either the

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,100
government agency private sector or

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,780
starting the on business through the

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,730
skills they learn in the project which

00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:50,330
is always a very nice outcome in

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,950
potentially life-changing experience and

00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,600
also some time it's simpler in Sri Lanka

00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,400
for instance we managed to work with the

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,110
local community because they were really

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,180
interesting in routings they really

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,950
wanted to use the apps to be able to

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,800
navigate around Sri Lanka because the

00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,690
google map is not good there so they

00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,830
were coming to mapping parties to teach

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:12,810
others to autumn app and finally I think

00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,940
something that might be neglecting a

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,950
little bit is that we often trained on

00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,320
nothing but then to make it sustainable

00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,090
you need other skills and mapping you

00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,760
might need to write grant application

00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,860
you might need to to to have this

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,520
personal development aspect so I think

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:31,890
it's something that as as we as I said

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,810
maybe tension between getting a map done

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,240
but I think we should think about

00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:39,630
integrating more of those into into

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,300
project design too and so and and also I

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,250
think one key of the successes that we

00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,930
have numerous example work than this

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,790
local community where we started to work

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:51,840
in Bangladesh we found two or three

00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:54,360
people same thing in Nepal and so on and

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,790
then was organization like Red Cross Oh

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,280
MSF came and were able to hire the same

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,780
people and and create this link over

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,570
time between different organization

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,730
worse before each organization would

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,290
have gone after the other likely map two

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,280
or three times the same place and no one

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:13,380
would have even known about it so so at

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,180
the organizational level how do we

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,180
support this kind of Logar organization

00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:21,900
to to kind of thrive and continue I

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:24,540
think one part is really the kind of

00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,190
classic local chapter approach creating

00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,900
community connection in the country but

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,100
also mainly nice and making sure this

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,530
local communities are

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,450
to the international community's then

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,960
something we talked about we haven't

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:39,120
tried but I know a couple people mention

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,919
it to me recently several towns like

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,630
kind of a small grant system because a

00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,600
lot of the local organization don't need

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:48,419
much to actually do a lot of work so

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,610
having an easy way to kind of give a

00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,590
small small amount of money to keep the

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,630
organization going then there is I think

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,669
also something we haven't done very well

00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,400
and be interesting to yourself which is

00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:01,409
more on business development and need

00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,210
for economic models because at the end

00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:05,010
of the day everyone has to leave and if

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,159
openstreetmap isn't a good opportunity

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,409
to do that how can we help create like

00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,750
better like economic model around the

00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:15,720
use of sm and help write grants help

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:19,200
work with even create private companies

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,000
and and so and finally I think the

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,130
diversity of this community is also very

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,770
important I think in a lot of countries

00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:28,200
actually absence Madagascar are

00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,299
already organization with like women and

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,730
in technology is that are really

00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,380
interesting openstreetmap and i think

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:36,330
important to support to support those

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,340
two more specifically to to create a

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,919
more diverse community so that's a

00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,650
couple example i guess not all from

00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,110
different people he run here is the

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,700
kathmandu leaving my mansion in 80 like

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,770
threaten one I was talking with him

00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,720
yesterday and after like I guess five

00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,419
years now is like a local organization

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,580
that offers clear services around

00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:58,340
remapping openstreetmap and so on and

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:02,250
now they are getting hired whereas

00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,620
coming from very tough areas of 80 so

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,659
they really define a clear offer price

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,760
and then they're able now to go and talk

00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:12,720
to Hutchinson institution to sell them

00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:15,000
self and send their services and muskura

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,610
is another example that was done by

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,530
ground truth initiative finally at the

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:23,250
institutional level where we work the

00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:25,230
most so how oh I think some important

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,600
part here is really building trust in

00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,370
the data so we often do independent

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,309
quality assessment where we in all the

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,990
technical partners in scientific

00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:35,610
partners and even for instance you

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,860
Lanka's the survey Department of Sri

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,830
Lanka itself did the sir is a quality

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,480
assessment of the data we collected

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,789
and then I think the role of

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,880
universities is a very key as soon as

00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:50,580
this teacher OSN use mappers and I think

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,679
using really creating reusable

00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,289
curriculum that we can end off to

00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,169
universities to be able to to create

00:20:55,289 --> 00:21:00,179
more to add more people train because

00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:03,390
often we my rely in two three four

00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:05,399
people but often they go do a PhD a

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,799
masters they get hired and then the

00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:11,370
still very fragile ecosystem so I think

00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:14,429
you training more student in the

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:17,190
university is really key so I think

00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:20,490
there is great example of that already

00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:23,039
with luck in the US I think they've been

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:25,380
good effort for instance at GW to

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,389
integrate osm in the curriculum and also

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,659
overseas in indonesia in kathmandu where

00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:33,389
in flank out to where universities are

00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:37,830
starting to teach us and and and finally

00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:39,510
i think the government aspect that takes

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,279
the most time I think but we've been

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,649
successful in now in quite a few places

00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:47,370
friends in Malawi nowadays purely

00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:49,019
government-led mapping initiative in the

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,360
Philippine the same thing so after a

00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:55,649
couple years you start getting traction

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,630
and I guess these are just reflecting

00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:59,100
those who can we measure the

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:01,529
sustainability I think these are just

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:05,730
ideas that reflex or we be that

00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:10,260
sustainability and so finally yeah I

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:12,510
guess that's that's it I love to we love

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,460
our team and partners to collaborate

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,919
more and how can we push further those

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,720
approaches and have a more mythology to

00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:23,419
make those project more successful and

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,419
build more local communities

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,680
Thank You Vivian there's a lot to it and

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,230
we just heard from two different

00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,390
communities kind of one REE energizing

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:42,290
and one way you gain people but both

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:44,450
it's important for the community to to

00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,520
