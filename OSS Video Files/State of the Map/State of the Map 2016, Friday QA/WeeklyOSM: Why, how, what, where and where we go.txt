Title: WeeklyOSM: Why, how, what, where and where we go
Publication date: 2016-10-13
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Friday QA
Description: 
	Manfred Reiter, Laura Barroso at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/weeklyosm-why-how-what-where-and-where-we-go/
With forums, blogs, social media and more than 150 international mailing lists (and 50 regional lists in Germany alone) it is not possible for an interested mapper to be informed on the ongoings of the global community. In order to fill this gap Wochennotiz/weeklyOSM was created. It attempts to offer a way for publish all the projects and application developed for people who are passionate about OSM.

In this talk weâ€™ll share our experiences in the process of making the weeklyOSM every week for multiple languages (German, Spanish, English, Japanese, Czech), how we do it, how we proceed to collect every news and how we choose which get published. We will also discuss the impact on the OSM global communities.

as a proof as a proofreader and to be

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:37,430
fair I learned a lot about openstreetmap

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:41,820
and we started in 2013 together with

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:44,189
Rafael Avila coya okay stop who is

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,880
present here we started a convenience

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,680
project I don't know these people who

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,659
are not from Europe they don't know what

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,570
chimeneas project our convenience

00:01:51,659 --> 00:02:00,659
projects are cool project and with

00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:03,890
several countries and we had in mind

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,890
doesn't work

00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:16,110
okay well we started this convenience

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:19,800
project and in 2014 Pascal nice said he

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:24,330
translated some pages from the German

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:28,910
wasn't note it's always too into English

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,910
and Satoshi either kissed

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,140
you

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:18,840
clean lists and only to know only in

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:22,830
Germany who have more than 65 mailing

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:26,910
lists and what's happening in this

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:29,070
mailing list we have to extract what is

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,030
interesting or not for the whole

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:37,650
community and very often things are

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:40,170
happening in Latin America which which

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:45,090
can be a good example for the rest of

00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:48,260
the community as well so that is how it

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,260
looks like it looks good

00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:13,219
and as we started this project with

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,239
several schools we had a starting point

00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:20,239
and the idea from the beginning was that

00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:23,299
we overhand the project after after the

00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:26,679
chimeneas project that we over hand this

00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:30,679
to the community and it worked very well

00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:35,079
because the community accepted what we

00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:38,389
did the first one who joined this

00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:42,129
originally European project was Satoshi

00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:58,929
either from Japan and then other

00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:58,929
languages came up ten minutes over

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,750
ok

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:57,210
i will show you some statistics what we

00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:02,190
found out then i show you very quickly

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:05,630
how to some theoretical things and i

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:12,440
would like to show you as well Oh SMBC

00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:12,440

but you will get the slides so don't

00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:58,009
worry about it and and but really is a

00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:59,629
pity that I can not show you this block

00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,580
collector this plot collector is

00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:06,159
absolutely fantastic it was built

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:09,349
especially for our needs needs means

00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:12,770
somebody from the 25 people who are

00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:19,569
working and scanning the mailing lists

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:22,490
and the forums and so on they find any

00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:26,379
interesting issue they put it into the

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:30,680
into our block collector and after that

00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:34,699
anybody is able to write what do to

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:39,469
write the article about it at the

00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:43,610
beginning we had a sequence work first

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:47,089
was produced the German the german von

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:50,240
dort eats afterwards it was translated

00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:53,480
to English then to Spanish at all the

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,630
other languages and that was at that was

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,089
absolutely nonsense today it is possible

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:02,720
that the Spanish version appears before

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:06,500
the German versions is out even if the

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:14,680
evenness the Spanish group works quicker

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:19,510
than the others only to know we don't

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:23,389
about these we are scanning every week

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:27,350
more than 30 mailing lists seven forums

00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:30,459
wiki Twitter blocks telegram groups and

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,459
so on

00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:49,280
now the I it's really a pity but I

00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:51,470
invite you to come on Sunday to the to

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:59,410

you the block collector on Sunday the

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:05,750
week the weekly is produced for example

00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,380
the Spanish version today is produced in

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:15,710
Cuba laura is guiding the group we have

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:23,720
people from netbox in ni ni akuto so

00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:25,580
undress 33 people who are reviewing the

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,150
spanish version if it is translated and

00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:33,670
so on the English group we have here our

00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:38,000
leader from this from the English group

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:48,190
it is Jean alpha Leah from India from

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,190
Bangalore and well what more

00:10:49,570 --> 00:11:03,410
what we have in mind is to integrate in

00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:07,520
the future the time is up okay what we

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:10,670
have in mind is to integrate more

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,210
languages I have here a slide where you

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:19,130
can see where the groups are and there

00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:22,570
is no one from Africa there is no French

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:26,200
version we have we produce at the moment

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:32,930
versions in German English Spanish

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:37,160
Russian Czech and in Japanese so what is

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:39,070
missing we are missing I think we are

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,240
missing French I think we are missing

00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:47,930
probably Portuguese we had for some time

00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:51,890
indonesian in our project as it is so

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:55,880
much work every week I can understand if

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:59,900
people say okay it's too much and we can

00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:05,570
do it and the question was where we go

00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:08,300
and another pity is I would like to show

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:11,420
you where we go and we have a result we

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:18,350
have a surprise for you maybe you can

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:22,880
look at tinyurl.com / weekly osm there

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:28,460
is an app Laura produce and this app you

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:31,670
can see all all the blocks in all

00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:41,030
languages and even more Laura integrate

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:44,270
it first why we did this this with this

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:48,290
app we we didn't find any application

00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:51,890
that summarize all the news from urban

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:55,430
asset map and so we saw we think that

00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:59,680
will be really nice to have not only the

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:03,550
content of weekly osm in every

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,660
in every language but and the the more

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:10,210
famous blocks in our community we are

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,820
talking about the osm block we are

00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:15,550
talking about a southern cinemas and

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:18,220
we're talking about the open case data

00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:22,120
and if you want when you download the

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:25,450
application you can sell us a suggestion

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:28,690
about it and the block that you want to

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:32,020
put on our application so the

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:36,910
application is is really good it has a

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:41,980
few futures like it displays all the ADI

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:46,209
the diversions the available versions of

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:49,630

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:52,750
allows the users like for example the

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:56,160
cuban user who have internet problems

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:58,600
they can see the news once they get

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,300
offline because the application I

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,760
storage the news so you don't have to

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:07,959
