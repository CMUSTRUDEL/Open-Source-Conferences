In September 2016 it will 4 years will have passed since OpenStreetMap changed its licence from CC by-SA 2.0 to the ODbL 1.0. Time to make a tally of the aftermath.

The session will cover * a final damage estimate * the guideline process, guidelines in force and what is in the works * the day-to-day work of the Licence Working Group * a look at the future

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,310
okay then we'll move on to the last

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,310
speaker of the day Simon

00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,660
okay okay floor is yours good good

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,700
evening I'm going to try and keep you

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,530
all awake and start off with a small

00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,180
quiz it's july two thousand and seven

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,970
how many contributors to the

00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,830
OpenStreetMap data were they at this

00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,600
point in time I should point out I see a

00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:04,920
couple of people that are excluded from

00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:13,119
answering this question nobody knows or

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:16,680
you're awfully off Dermot okay you're

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:20,410
going in the wrong direction there were

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,119
1125 contributors to the osm data it's a

00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,640
bit of a fuzzy number because at that

00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:29,320
time there were still anomalous

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:39,899
contributions what happened then july

00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:39,899
two thousand seven nobody knows hmmm no

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:48,820
Sultan Manchester and what happened

00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:51,549
there there was a panel now a panel

00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:57,430
people decided that the current license

00:01:51,549 --> 00:02:00,580
sucked and that we should change at the

00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:04,900
time though is M data was licensed CC

00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:08,890
by-sa 2.0 a share alike license Creative

00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,140
Commons designed for creative works

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:16,120
which are normally the subject of

00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:21,160
copyright and it just didn't really work

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:24,400
for data and even Creative Commons were

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,760
saying that at that point in time so it

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:33,060
was decided to undertake an effort to

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,060
change the license which brings us to

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:41,140
December 2009 how many contributors to

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:50,489
the OS and data set did we have at that

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:50,489
point in time anybody know look

00:02:52,340 --> 00:03:08,670
no no okay there were 90 3403 and why

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,000
did he take two years well yeah two

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:17,760
years massive growth essentially

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:23,340
ninety-nine percent and what happened

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:26,550
then this is probably too difficult but

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:31,140
there was a vote to change the OTB l by

00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:36,030
the osm eff members I think 400 or so to

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:40,620
300 voted now you're probably going to

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:43,830
ask why did this take so long was very

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:48,300
easy in july two thousand seven there

00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:52,620
was no license to change too so these

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:58,710
two years were used up developing the

00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:03,510
ODB l now to illustrate some of the

00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:08,240
sentiments at the time an excerpt from

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,240
the email on the legal talk list

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:24,130
certain interpretation of being rushed i

00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:29,980
have to say okay again a year later we

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:31,840
have 118,000 or sm contributors and this

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:37,660
is an important number for the rest of

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:39,940
the talk what happened then we actually

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,880
introduced the new contributor terms for

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:46,660
the sign up where they already agreed

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,720
that they would support the OD PL if we

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,310
switch to it this is more important than

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,400
most people think because this was

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,500
actually the point of no return because

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,500
from then on we had a contract with

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:03,790
every new sign up that was different

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:06,750
from what we had with the other 118,000

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,750
contributors

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:24,310
so it's jun 2011 and again something

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:27,010
happens we stop the decliners from

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,470
contributing they could still login and

00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,620
so on but they couldn't actually edit

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,150
the map I should point out that there

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,740
are many peoples in the audience here

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,020
which know a lot more about this than I

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:46,330
do because this is about roughly when I

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:50,110
became involved it's july two thousand

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:55,000
twelve everybody should remember that i

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:59,080
was around there what happened then we

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,960
started with acting the data and shortly

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:13,510
afterwards in tokyo we switch to the ODB

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:16,300
l and you can see it took a long time

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:21,060
five years and the question wasn't

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:23,820
actually during the whole period yeah

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,620
what how hard is that going to hurt us

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:29,050
if you remember the number back then

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,260
when we actually put the new contributor

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:37,650
terms into force were 118,000

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:40,360
contributors of those 118,000

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:43,120
interesting enough 20,000 didn't

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,000
actually have any not deleted data in

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,480
the database and all our counts that we

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,960
did never considered them so there are

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:56,200
about 27,000 people that had actually

00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,430
contributed to the data now if those

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:04,420
when we switch the licence 75,000 had

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:08,560
agreed the small number of 279 had

00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:13,210
disagreed and we had nearly 40,000 which

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,700
hadn't responded and we redacted data

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,669
from Iraq of redacted essentially

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:23,260
removed the data or removed the edits

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:25,690
from roughly 50,000 people 50,000 if

00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,060
to the the number say as being the

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:34,030
people that didn't actually have any

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:36,520
undeleted data now people can remember

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:40,150
that Iran scripts giving all these

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,420
numbers and I actually read random last

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:47,340
month or beginning of this month and

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:53,070
currently we have 60 2353 which agreed

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:59,140
so actually 5,000 people came back post

00:07:53,070 --> 00:08:00,940
license change and agreed to the

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,740
contributor terms that's quite a

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,290
significant number because we only had

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,560
90 thousand or so which had data so

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,930
which serve five percent effect and even

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,720
some of the people that disagreed

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:16,720
changed their mind unluckily that didn't

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:21,490
really help because we had already

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:26,500
deleted the data not just to give you an

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:29,070
idea what the effect roughly was when we

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,590
deleted the data so rough about 1%

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,940
plus/minus might away this is a bit

00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,310
pessimistic numbers because the

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,640
projected numbers and not what we

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:46,860
actually deleted but it was not more

00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:49,240
than this now one of the things that

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,740
people said you know yeah it's too early

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,500
in September in July 2012's it oh you're

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,930
rushing us you should wait and Chi and

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,400
you know spend another year tracking

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:07,120
down people well you know if you look at

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,940
these numbers and this is what if so

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,970
it's using the full history done from

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,270
July 2012 running the same scripts but

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:19,030
with the current number of people that

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:22,150
had agreed you will notice that the

00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:25,810
difference is very very small so in the

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:29,050
end I think we more or less hit the

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:32,530
optimum point in time to change the

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:35,050
license now the thing which I haven't

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,550
listened listed and which you can't

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,970
express

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:43,740
numbers is really the other part of the

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:48,440
story namely that between 2007 and 2000

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:51,870
2500 of the main topic in OpenStreetMap

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,779
was the license change and the

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:58,730
concentration was completely on that and

00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:01,829
lots of things didn't get done at a time

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:05,519
when the community went up from just

00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:08,279
over a thousand people up to 280

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:14,640
thousand and I think that was the

00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:18,060
largest part of the damage now naturally

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,149
since 2012 we've had constant moaning

00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,649
that we should change the license but

00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:24,029
everybody who was involved in the

00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,750
process would think well you know I'd

00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:31,399
rather cut off a piece of my body

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,399
instead of doing that at least right now

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:41,940
so that brings me to my talk as you

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:45,839
probably know I'm a long time being

00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:49,350
involved on the administrative side of

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,390
openstreetmap I've been on the board and

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,089
currently I'm the chair of the license

00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:57,329
working group and what flows is more or

00:10:54,089 --> 00:11:01,350
less my brain dump about you know what

00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:03,709
are the issues right now perhaps even

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:11,279
saying that the no issues right now and

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:13,170
what our daily business is one of the

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,870
questions in preparing this Nerdist

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:21,510
thought was well you know we always say

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:23,760
we need a licence and we don't really

00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,510
clearly say what we want from that

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,910
license well one thing is clear our

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,850
contributor terms that are essentially

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:37,620
immutable so the license has to be free

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:41,660
and open essentially means doesn't

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,660
discriminate against any kind of use

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:49,810
and hot topic at least for historical

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,300
reasons we started off with a share

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:56,440
alike license we've continued that on

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:59,650
and there's no indication right now that

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,110
a larger part of the community would

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:05,590
want to change not saying that change is

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:09,630
impossible also on but it's there's not

00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:17,320
been a groundswell of support for

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:21,670
changing to something else now what does

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,220
the the incorporation documents for the

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,930
OpenStreetMap foundation say well they

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,930
say we should be encouraging the growth

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:32,500
development and distribution of freak

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:36,850
geospatial data and providing geospatial

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:40,540
data for anybody to use and share now at

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:43,600
least for me and I have fully admit that

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:48,370
this is completely subjective that

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:53,260
implies a couple of things the license

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:57,250
should be simple to apply we have a

00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:59,350
unified data set one is the one of the

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,540
small number of things that I agree with

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,760
Mike mikorski is actually that the

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:08,410
unified data set is one of the biggest

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,500
assets of openstreetmap so we should

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:17,500
have unified terms of use for our data

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:22,530
to make it simple and the other thing

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:25,330
for making it easy to use our data for

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,700
any consumers is that there should be a

00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,130
single license also a single person who

00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,190
licenses the data and a single point of

00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,190
contact

00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:39,499
now the license working group and have

00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:43,759
to admit that most of this work was done

00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:46,379
with little involvement on my behalf has

00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,829
issued a number of guidelines which have

00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:53,069
gone through a community process of

00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:57,920
comments not necessarily community

00:13:53,069 --> 00:14:02,069
approval but which have in the end being

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,019
agreed to by the board of the OS MF

00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:05,550
there's a guideline on what substantial

00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,160
is there's a guideline on what a

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,519
produced work is there's a guideline on

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,490
trivial transformations and so on and

00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:18,259
all these are essentially there to

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:20,970
clarify gray areas in the license and

00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,829
don't believe that though davail is

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,360
particularly complicated because we need

00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:26,999
all these guidelines it's actually

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,550
relatively simple but the problem is

00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:32,850
naturally that we have geospatial data

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:36,389
and geospatial data is different than

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:40,879
say if we be replying it to the key

00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:42,929
pedia data so there are always

00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:47,360
clarifications needed when you are

00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:47,360
playing a license to a specific subject

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:56,730
now what we're working on right now is a

00:14:54,029 --> 00:15:00,179
review of the import licenses this is

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:02,970
mainly been triggered by questions with

00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:06,059
respect to the Creative Commons by 4.0

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:08,939
license which unluckily a lot of

00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:13,800
governments are switching to for their

00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:16,790
open data license but in general

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:21,509
naturally other import licenses belong

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:24,720
into this review as well that impacts

00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:26,879
the license or status of the OS MF are

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,490
we really the licensure of the data if

00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:33,269
we import something which is license CC

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:40,470
by 4.0 and it impacts the unified

00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:45,540
license terms you can think of osm a bit

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:47,100
like a meat mincer I mean the lot of

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,360
nasty sinker things people say about

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,839
sausages but

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,149
essentially the sausage that you get out

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,040
and you go and buy at the butcher you

00:15:54,149 --> 00:16:00,950
wouldn't want to have different terms of

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:03,510
use for small parts of the sausage and

00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,670
you didn't vote when you probably

00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:08,220
wouldn't want to have multiple points of

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:10,350
contact if the sausage wasn't good and

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,240
you would go back to your butcher and

00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,029
the butcher would say well you know but

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,290
that data is from somebody else and I'm

00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:22,230
not the licensor so that's actually an

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:28,800
important point for making things easy

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:31,890
to use what we're specifically not

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:37,380
working on right now is a geocoding

00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:42,000
guideline I'll come back to that ODB a

00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:43,740
1.1 not working on that either and with

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:51,000
definitely not working on a license

00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:54,180
change just to clarify if at one point

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,500
in time somebody we come to the

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,199
conclusion that we should change your

00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,360
license the omf board would actually

00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:02,760
have to give us a mandate to do so and

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,079
work on it and that hasn't happened so

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:09,750
we're not going to start working on that

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:11,549
offer on our own accord but when I had

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,400
wrote rid all this down I came to

00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:17,790
conclusion well you know that's our

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,709
shopping list where people which have

00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,919
been working with always him for a long

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:24,449
time some of us has legal or legal

00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,490
professionals and so on and they all

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:30,929
have different questions so what I did

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:37,010
was look at our legal questions mayor

00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:43,919
box which we've had active since January

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:47,120
2015 and I sifted through 321 males and

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,070
try to categorize them and

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,809
categorization is relatively rough and I

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:56,460
only took the main subject so in

00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,600
principle you could have counted double

00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:03,400
count and stuff but I didn't do that

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:05,530
and it's quite interesting we had a fair

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,020
large number and continued have a fairly

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:13,270
large number of requests for media

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:15,549
releases so this is like Fox Fox system

00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,410
Fox is one of those which have come in

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:19,690
as well where you know we're producing

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,929
this film and we need you to fill out

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:26,620
this five page media release so that we

00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:28,720
include your map in our production that

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:32,140
you read through that five page media

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,020
release and you say no way because

00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:37,929
there's lots of stuff which you can't do

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:44,830
like warrant that or the data is ours

00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:48,010
and so on the next one is commercial use

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,840
a lot of people seem to be of the

00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,820
opinion year what they need special

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,150
permission if they're using it in an app

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:58,530
or perhaps my app will have to be

00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:02,140
licensed on Oh dbl terms and so on

00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:06,220
that's fairly common question and the

00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:09,940
next one is the one you would expect i'm

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:13,929
using osm data together with third-party

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:18,370
data do I have is to share like apply or

00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:20,020
doesn't it and those are the most

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,870
difficult ones and the rest are

00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:26,500
essentially attribution questions where

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,970
do I and how do I attribute then we have

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,789
the couple of interesting ones like

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:35,200
where do i how much do services from the

00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:38,140
omf cost which I always answer with a

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,909
long list of stuff that says well it's

00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:43,390
actually free but you can go to a

00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:47,559
commercial service provider so running

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:52,330
out of time here or it has touched on

00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:55,720
that 321 total 207 license or terms of

00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:57,159
service related does not include two

00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,320
dozen or so that went to the legal

00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:04,929
working group directly and yes nobody

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,630
inquired about bulk geocoding some of

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:09,320
them might have should have done that

00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:14,360
but they didn't

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,919
and to finish off experience our current

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,340
material and guidelines actually cover

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,259
most of the use cases for a lots of

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,309
people the license terms seem to be more

00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:23,929
relaxed than they would actually

00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:27,679
experience though all these people that

00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:29,950
are asking about commercial use there's

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,830
currently no good way to deal with

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,720
releases for film TV and video and the

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,779
current tired license which most of

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,220
these media releases refer to actually

00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,350
doesn't work at all and it doesn't make

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,779
sense it's a historic letter over left

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,659
over and if we should change something

00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:50,059
then we should probably change that and

00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:53,659
only a very small number of the proposed

00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:59,629
data users wouldn't actually be possible

00:20:53,659 --> 00:21:01,899
under current license regime really on

00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:01,899
time

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:15,350
quit any questions for a speaker yep

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,030
thanks for the talk quick question you

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,950
mentioned that geocoding guideline is

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:50,910
not in work can you expand a little bit

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:54,090
on this and I just saying that it

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,920
currently isn't in work from a logical

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,380
point of view we wanted to get that

00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,050
collective database guideline out of the

00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,870
way because that is actually the

00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:07,560
foundation for any work that we do with

00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:10,200
which has to do with using third-party

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,760
data with openstreetmap date and from a

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,130
logical point of view that should come

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:20,910
first it is not particularly high or now

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:24,060
to do list simply because as I said it's

00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:27,060
not something that people outside of the

00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:30,450
service provider ecosystem around

00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:32,460
openstreetmap ask for so I'm not saying

00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,640
it's unimportant it just saying you know

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,370
there's other stuff which we might be

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,560
looking at and the licence working group

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,500
sometimes require selves the legal

00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,020
working group does do other stuff as

00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:50,090
well we have other documents in the work

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,090
which are currently a bit more important

00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:00,670
sorry can I question one of the

00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:03,490
assumptions I'm I'm fairly new to the

00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:07,060
community so when wicked ADA was first

00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:10,060
happening decision was made to go cc0

00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:12,550
for a very simple reason that about two

00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,440
reasons one it's very easy to consume

00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,120
it's hard to get the data in toluca

00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,000
later but it's very very easy to consume

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,790
for any kind of use cases and second

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,590
data is fairly hard to license by

00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,860
definition of the data because like the

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,900
height of Everest is not licensable you

00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,700
can try it collection licensure so has

00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,400
there been much talk in terms of like

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:41,440
switching away from the essay part to

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:44,350
c20 and historically you have to

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:49,030
understand this is before my time is

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:52,720
that CC by-sa was chosen essentially as

00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:54,760
an anti Google license and by the way we

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,890
know that the same sentiments in the

00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:03,450
wikimedia foundation in some places as

00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:07,210
well and it was discussed at the time

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:10,570
very intensively and that was the big

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:14,010
argument besides a couple of landsman of

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:16,690
mine which wanted to stick with CC by-sa

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:21,810
but everybody else essentially the

00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:25,180
discussion was OD PL or pd or CC 0 and

00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:28,930
right now there's as I said there's no

00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:32,760
real motivation to change if there was a

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:35,230
groundswell of support for moving away

00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,270
obviously we would discuss it and

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:40,690
naturally there's lots of problems and

00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:42,670
the OTB is a fairly complicated license

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:46,140
not an absolute scales but relative to

00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:51,550
some of the simpler things because of

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:53,230
data being complicated to license I'm on

00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:56,380
the data working group so i can speak

00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:59,070
specifically to the idea of going to CC

00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:03,640
0 and it would involve removing

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:04,720
basically all imported data outside the

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:10,049
US

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:12,549
probably hit around forty percent of the

00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:14,620
say twenty to forty percent of the data

00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:18,909
in OpenStreetMap depending on how you

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:23,190
measure it completely obliterate all

00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:27,520
addresses all buildings and some areas

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:29,590
basically switching to CC 0 will not

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,900
happen because it will exclude using

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:36,870
most government open data and it may

00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,640
aside from that it may conflict with the

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:43,000
contributor term after deep attribution

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,950
requirements I mean Paul just made it

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,919
clear nobody would actually consider

00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:50,710
going to CC 0 the effect of that would

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,880
be disastrous but you could discuss

00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:59,200
going to a a buell based license of some

00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,559
kind but there's a lot of difficult

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,559
details

00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:18,200
I'm just like curious like since osm is

00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:21,769
hosted in the UK if the brexit thing

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:25,370
ever like happens then like do we still

00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:27,649
have like database right sir I mean they

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:36,139
have you thought about like I don't know

00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:40,009
like what the impact is 40 so well the

00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:41,960
serious answer is nobody knows they're

00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:44,149
not so serious answer is that we keep on

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,929
making jokes about brexit and I just had

00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:51,919
beef with Louie former legal person with

00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:54,169
freaky media were joking about you know

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,919
who knows what's going to happen I mean

00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:59,659
we it's just we have one of the ongoing

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,549
documents that were working on and

00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:04,159
actually which has just been approved by

00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:08,409
the osm f board is a new version of the

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:12,049
privacy policy which again is

00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:15,860
potentially impacted by breaks it in one

00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:18,169
to two years so nobody knows but the

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,240
license itself is designed to work

00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:24,889
without actually database rights

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:27,649
existing in every country so in

00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:30,610
principle it should there should be no

00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:30,610
serious problem

00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,250
whether what are the means of the

00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,250
foundation to check whether people break

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:51,240
the license I mean if we suspect some

00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:55,260
company is using OpenStreetMap data they

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,300
don't share it alike with the hondata do

00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:00,720
you have a means to to go and

00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:10,380
investigate what's going on and to prove

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:12,720
it just want I actually always have

00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,910
extra slides and but unluckily my

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,350
computer is not responding so I can show

00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:23,580
you to them we got we get regularly we

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:26,340
get enforcement requests typically we

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,950
try to push them back down to the local

00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:32,280
communities because these are typically

00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:38,070
local operators and only if that doesn't

00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:41,460
work we will try and engage because

00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:44,160
anything else just wouldn't scale so

00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,900
it's really important that we only try

00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,640
and implement processes which actually

00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:52,350
scale a little bit and again and one of

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,450
the things is proving things I mean I've

00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,280
made a fool of myself often enough going

00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:59,550
to Google and saying well we've heard

00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:02,850
that somebody has copied OpenStreetMap

00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:05,850
data into Google and most of the time

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:08,730
you know it could be that the people are

00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:12,990
inspired or it could be real coping but

00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:17,280
it's extremely difficult to prove there

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:19,320
are other things non attribution using

00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,400
the whole data set in some way which is

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:25,470
naturally far easier to show and most of

00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,200
the time it's just you know not people

00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:31,670
being nasty does people think oh we

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,670
didn't realize that we had to do that

00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,990
one last question

00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:49,570
yeah so initially you shared some

00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:53,310
numbers on how the change in license

00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:56,260
increase the number of contributors Oh

00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:58,510
so what is the right way because my

00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:01,330
question was how did the change in

00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:07,330
license sort of have an impact on the

00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:11,110
increase the increase in users was

00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:15,130
completely independent of the change in

00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:17,950
license if a particular 2007-2009

00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:21,130
increase has mainly to do with Richard

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:24,490
fairhurst who wrote to the potlatch one

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:33,640
at a time and he's not here because the

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:36,250
meeting was too hot but what the impact

00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,750
is really was and that the big problem

00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,360
was really that we didn't actually take

00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,420
the community which grew so much in that

00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,160
time through the whole process why we

00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,180
were actually changing the license it

00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,890
was a very small group small panel in

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,320
2007 which essentially made the decision

00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:57,420
and when the things happened we had

00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:59,590
nearly 300,000 users and that's

00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:03,160
problematic and should be kept at the

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:05,320
back of our heads for any future change

00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:09,580
that we need to manage that a bit better

00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:13,540
and faster if possible so I think we're

00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:15,790
finished okay if you have any more

00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:18,900
questions feel free to ask silent later

00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,900
let's thank our speaker again

00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:25,700
for tackling this rather heavy subject

00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:28,059
so late on a Friday evening that

00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,059
