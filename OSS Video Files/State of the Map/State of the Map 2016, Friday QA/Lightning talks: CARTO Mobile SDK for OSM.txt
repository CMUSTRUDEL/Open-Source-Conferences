ask improvised lightning talk before we

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,740
move on to the concluding presentation

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,380
of today I give you the word thank you

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,610
and try to make very quick I have a huge

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,340
karma tipped I imported full country

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,310
corrine data dopants openstreetmap it

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,859
was ten years ago so last ten years I've

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,400
spent removing all the state but luckily

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,390
my account is not blocked so I'm dealing

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:36,000
also with the contribution to them

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:39,480
openstreetmap so what I've done since

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,280
about the same time is using

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,789
openstreetmap in mobile and trying to

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,129
make it available in mobile I started in

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,690
a new t-tech with Jay to meet some soon

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,530
be on blackberry all those different

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,620
tools things quite long ago starting

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,670
with Google Maps tiles until Google's

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,739
and legal letter to stop it because

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,979
openstreetmap was not good enough then

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:09,420
yet but then the software is available

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:15,570
available as a GPL option so it is open

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:17,880
source and passed forward to 2012 the

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,060
software was free for openstreetmap

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,930
users so to make kind of give back a

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,049
little bit to the community now fast

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,780
forward to this year nughty tech is part

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:34,400
of co 2 DB which is now just called

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,140
court on and we use vector types from

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,259
openstreetmap quite a lot as for base

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,659
maps something what you have seen by

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,869
some other tools also we're using

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,850
cortices is a styling language and you

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,850
can use even your own sources you don't

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,860
need to use up my street map if that's

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,250
not enough maybe your own private

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,880
openstreetmap server also we do offline

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,000
routing and we provide online and

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,820
offline openstreetmap planet so that's

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,690
all kind of bundled and it works into

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,640
and healthy in 3d in 2d and it supports

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,180
actually quite many languages we have

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,900
done special afford to support

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,030
asian languages Arabic specifically all

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,019
this tricky right to left carrying

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:26,739
issues yeah we have tried to solve all

00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:31,019
of those but one limitation was that it

00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:36,120
was these with commercial license and

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:38,889
now fast forward to the future 2016

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,340
October we will open sources Mobile SDK

00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:45,159
because there are never enough nice Matt

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:49,180
rendering tools for openstreetmap so let

00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:51,310
let have one one extra of course with

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,299
white also set the price services in top

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:58,569
of that and you will be able to find it

00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:01,989
from github from Carter DB github page

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:04,870
so take a look and see as one of the

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,849
alternatives to the different

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:16,419
openstreetmap there vector tile

00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:24,909
renderers okay we have time for one

00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:27,329
quick question if there is any no

00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:27,329
