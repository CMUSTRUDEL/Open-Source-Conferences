Title: Is she a part of your community?
Publication date: 2016-10-13

http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/is-she-a-part-of-your-community/

OSM is a global community and yet not diverse in the gender aspect. Though considerable effort has gone into introducing more women to the community, the transformation of newcomers into long standing contributors to the community doesnâ€™t happen automatically. There seems to be need for dedicated efforts to help novice women gain their foothold in the domain.

Based on her efforts and experiments to improve the diversity of the community, Srravya will propose three specific guidelines as a first step for communities to provide a congenial environment for women to be active participants. The talk will also touch upon the importance of participation from all genders and not just women. The aim is not just to promote and increase participation of women but to evolve as a truly open and diverse community with participants from all and any gender.

hello everybody my name is

00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:10,610
Shravya and this is what we're going to

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:14,190
be looking at is she about a few

00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:17,550
community.the she specifically is in

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,990
italics because when I say she I don't

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,029
only mean the female gender but broadly

00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:28,320
the genders that are underrepresented in

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,779
our community so zooming in on the

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,230
gender diversity in osm so I'm not sure

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,300
how many of you noticed but in the call

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,579
for applications for talks and

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,460
scholarships there was a particular

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,340
check box which said I am a woman so

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,850
that got me wondering about the gender

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,719
composition of our community and that

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,660
has resulted in this talk so my name is

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,809
Shravya quite a weird spelling I come

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,969
from India and where I Wallen clear with

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,660
our free software movement which was

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,780
also my introduction 200 SM I mostly

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,369
edit data in India and when it's global

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,189
it's mostly translations to Indian

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:15,869
languages and I'm also part of the

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:18,030
weekly osm English team so when I first

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,810
wanted to understand the gender

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,509
composition in osm I tried to find an

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,270
existing tool or a methodology to do

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,759
this but it's quite unfortunate that I

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,280
could actually not find anything which

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,829
could give me very statistical data on

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:42,060
how the gender composition stands in our

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:44,280
community so I have picked mailing list

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,130
as one of the as the means of

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,280
understanding the gender diversity in

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,610
our community and this is because it's

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,149
the space for both newcomers and

00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,310
experienced mappers

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,130
I mean experience mappers pretty much

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,189
live on our mailing lists and for

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,979
newcomers it's a very easy first step to

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,439
come and say hey hi I want to work in

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,129
OSM this is what I want to do how do I

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,800
get started

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,200
that sort of a thing and not just

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,930
discussions we've seen a lot of event

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,580
reminder

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,110
announcements doubts discussions

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,050
discussions that sometime turn into

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:24,710
debates all sorts of things and more

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:27,680
importantly with the mailing lists and

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:30,650
in the mailing list is unique because

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,010
all the other forums for instance forum

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,770
OpenStreetMap or help or the blog posts

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,410
we cannot really get a closer look at

00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,480
how specific communities work but in the

00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,630
case of mailing lists we can take a look

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,360
at how osm works at large how how the

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,850
gender composition is in osm at large

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,500
and also particularly in specific

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,810
communities if I wanted to understand

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,850
specifically for us I can go to the u.s.

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,420
mailing list similarly with Europe Asia

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:01,100
and things like that so I've picked

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,920
mailing list as a means to analyze

00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:07,100
gender diversity and this is what I've

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,320
done so i from the like Manfred

00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,040
mentioned the one for 160 odd mailing

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,800
lists I've picked up a few of them

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,710
mostly geographically diverse and for

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,370
the last one year from September 2016 to

00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:26,000
August 2000 no September 2015 to August

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,860
2016 I've gone through the archives and

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,040
studied the archives of all these lists

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:34,130
to understand the women participation in

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,470
our lists so what I've done is a binary

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,140
classification based on user name and

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,510
try to arrive at numbers to say that

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,730
this is the percentage of female

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,490
participation in our community on a

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:50,420
monthly basis and finally got an annual

00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:52,880
average for the last year so this is how

00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,160
the numbers look I'm pretty sure in some

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,950
cases you will have to squint your way

00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:01,130
to look at the numbers I've specifically

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,840
put it this way because just as faint as

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,240
the numbers are that's how the

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,310
communication and involvement is also

00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,300
this is only a representation of how

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:14,180
things are so if you look at it the US

00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:18,080
and some of the Europe lists Australia

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,940
it's all in single digits and it's

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,060
interesting to note that in the case of

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,010
Latin America nearly one-third of

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,350
the community involvement on the mailing

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:30,530
list comes from women which is quite

00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:33,350
interesting to observe and apart from

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,120
the communities themselves if you take a

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,620
look at the tagging mailing list so the

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,560
tagging mailing list is one of the most

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,240
high-volume lists where on a month on a

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,590
monthly basis we see close to four

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,340
hundred five hundred messages

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:49,700
but only 2% I think that's the least

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,419
visible number only 2% of them come from

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,520
women and so for those of you who were

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:58,310
not aware there was a there is a

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,310
diversity talk mailing list which was

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:05,620
quite active for a year or so but since

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:09,080
2015 does not bring any activity and

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:14,060
talk iron I am from India and in talk

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:16,910
iron we see of 14.7 and most of it the

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,530
credit goes to the credits for the

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,229
number which indicate female

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,720
participation go to gin goes to general

00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,310
who is sitting here so every month

00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:32,270
there's like yeah she deserves a huge

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:34,940
round of applause so it was quite it

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,760
felt good to finally see some consistent

00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,260
involvement from women so in the in the

00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,120
case of India if I probably remove

00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,690
general's messages it'll it'll drop to

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,760
like four or three percent again so some

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,530
of the observations from the from this

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,990
study is yeah

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,030
one was blatantly obvious there's barely

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,780
any women participating in our

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,789
discussions and the one more important

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,800
thing was in the case of latam in the

00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:02,539
case of India we saw that the numbers

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,630
somehow successfully touched a double

00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:07,880
double digit but what we need to

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,370
understand is that these are very low

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,590
volume lists so let's say there are on

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,919
an average only 50 messages sent on that

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,740
list per month so even five will account

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,720
for a significant proportion but in the

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,270
case of tagging mailing list were see we

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,340
see around like five hundred mils five

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,220
is a very small number so what I'm

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,620
trying to say is that the number of the

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,470
the actual involvement of women across

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,619
these lists is the same because the

00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,869
overall number like varies

00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:40,779
we saw like a bigger number case in

00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:43,869
point is actually latam so because I

00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:45,849
noticed a 30 percent participation I

00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:49,059
reached out to Laura I reached out to

00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:49,839
Celine Miriam to try and understand how

00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:52,059
they do this

00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,519
I told Miriam okay wow you guys are

00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:56,109
doing a great job so how do you do this

00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,419
like the significant female

00:06:56,109 --> 00:07:00,759
participation and the response I got was

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:02,679
what what's wrong with you we're trying

00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,789
to improve our numbers like it's so bad

00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:10,629
no girls ever turn up so and finally

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:13,719
this could also be a very interesting

00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:15,789
observation so most of the participation

00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:19,479
that we see or anything that comes from

00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:22,929
women for most part has been hey I want

00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:24,429
to get started how do I get started so

00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:26,289
in so event is happening at this point

00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:28,299
in time just show up if you're

00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:31,449
interested mostly announcements and

00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:36,309
introductions no serious involvement in

00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:40,179
discussions so the bias in methodology

00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:42,909
this this method i I've got to admit has

00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:45,549
it has its gaps and I've called out most

00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:49,209
of them here so because the study is

00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:51,629
based on user names in the case of

00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:54,279
pseudonyms and gender-neutral names I

00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:57,399
did a couple of things I ran a search

00:07:54,279 --> 00:08:01,209
across the various osm profiles on help

00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:04,839
on forum on osm itself to find out the

00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:07,959
gender identity and where and also up on

00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:13,689
the online broadly like on github and

00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:17,769
Twitter so and non-obvious gender

00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:19,989
identity is um so while our name can

00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:22,899
only indicate at this moment if if I

00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:24,909
took the name John I'd probably think

00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:27,039
that it's a male but it's quite likely

00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:29,859
that the name could also identify the

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,529
person could identify as by another

00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:35,469
gender identity but because the study is

00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:40,089
based on only user names it does a very

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:43,120
binary classification and this is a

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:45,389
future scope for the study and the last

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,670
bias that could possibly be there is

00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:50,950
women contributors who probably act

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,170
contributing but not talking on the

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:56,170
mailing list now this is interesting

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,940
because it makes an assumption an

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,390
assumption that women are contributing

00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,360
but just not talking so one we are

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:08,050
assuming the unknown and two even if

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,180
this is the truth we have no idea if

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,270
it's the truth and even if it's the

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,390
truth if they're not communicating we

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:18,970
still have a serious problem to fix

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:21,760
but why osm is at the end of the day

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,700
just the map a map which is about places

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,540
about roads traverse widest gender

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:32,350
diversity matter so I did a quick study

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:35,500
with numbers I looked at the tag the

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,170
amenity shop equals car and globally I

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,620
found that it's been mapped close to 70

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:43,540
thousand times and car is something

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,110
that's gender neutral like a girl could

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:49,510
ride it a guy could ride it and

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:52,030
something like cosmetics which is mostly

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,820
considered female is only mapped a few

00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,740
hundred few thousand times so while this

00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,010
might not seem like a serious problem

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:03,280
we've got more so this is the map of

00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:05,640
India and on overpass I tried to look

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,260
for the immunity equal to toilets and

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,510
coming from India I'd like to add that

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,990
this is a very important community

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:16,060
public toilets are an essential thing in

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,670
India because not every household has

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:22,360
one so this is how it looks when I

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:25,210
queried for toilets and when I added

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,790
female equal to yes this is how the the

00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,040
tags the numbers just drop drastically I

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:33,070
wanted to find out if this is the same

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,770
across countries so I quickly did it in

00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:38,740
the different part of the world and the

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:41,650
results were pretty much the same I did

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:46,930
it again for public showers and the

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:48,970
trend continues so it's not that the

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,400
gender gap in our community is so wide

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,930
that it has the potential to affect the

00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,960
kind of map that we're building and

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,730
beyond the map it also affects the

00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,800
community and I'd like to share an

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,870
example from my own place so do you

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,570
anything strange about this design so

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:11,779
this was a t-shirt that was designed for

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:15,120
a workshop back at home and the the sari

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:17,370
so this t-shirt was designed for

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,850
participants of a workshop it was

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,709
designed by a male and when we when it

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,510
was up for review most of the people

00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:26,910
commented on hey let's change the color

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,880
let's change the font of the freedom and

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:33,360
things like that but it took a girl a

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,430
person who identifies as female to come

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,350
and say you've got the sea and the

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,839
circles in all the wrong places like

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,700
just remove them or move it to the back

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,459
girls are not going to be comfortable

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:48,000
wearing those so this is to highlight

00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:50,730
that we need gender participation

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,130
participation from all gender not just

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,410
to fill in the date or the gaps we find

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,540
in our maps but also for us to be a

00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,370
better community I mean none of us won't

00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:04,890
chase girls away from our community

00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:07,190
meetings - II so I agreed that this is a

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:11,070
huge problem so what do we do about it

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:13,680
first step we go out we reach out to

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,200
women try to bring them in introduce

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,290
them to the community hold exclusive

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,720
thoughts workshops mapping parties do

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,880
whatever it takes and one thing that I'd

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,700
like to point out is get them started in

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,010
their area of interest and do not assume

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,740
that their area of interest is sharp

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:34,079
sequel to cosmetics or marking toilets

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,240
as female they could be interested in

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,399
pretty much anything so try to identify

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,520
their area of interest and help them get

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,010
started there and in some cases

00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,810
introduction is a great step but for

00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,480
some of them we might need more than

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:51,570
that so just kind of have a look on them

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,850
see if they need any help and try to get

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,040
them involved in the community while you

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,199
get them started them or you might be a

00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,060
great mentor to them but also make sure

00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:02,269
that it doesn't end there and they get

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,680
involved in the community as well and

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:06,930
definitely definitely involve them in

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,550
decision making we do not want weird

00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:13,410
t-shirts out at any of our events and

00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,819
finally of providing an inclusive

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,439
environment

00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:18,629
could be very little things that we do

00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:21,209
starting from what kind of when you when

00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:22,410
you we hold our event at at what time we

00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:25,259
hold them do we have options for

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,089
babysitting can they bring kids along we

00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:29,999
could just call all these out in our

00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:31,949
event announcements I understand that

00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:35,059
providing all these is not a real

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:37,259
possibility all the time but at least

00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:39,149
acknowledging that we are aware of these

00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:41,609
sends out a strong message of inclusion

00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:46,049
that that I think should be an integral

00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:47,669
part of all the communities so we do all

00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:49,949
this there are more women in the

00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:54,239
community does that make or some gender

00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:58,289
diverse not exactly it's a great first

00:13:54,239 --> 00:14:00,989
step but gender diversity means a lot

00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:06,059
more than just more women more female

00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:08,339
participation so right now the amenity

00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:10,079
called toilets has only a binary

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:13,199
classification where we can tag it as

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,679
either unisex or male or female and

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,229
there's no recognition for other gender

00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,909
in such an immune amenity but I think we

00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:23,549
have a thing or two to learn from this

00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:25,739
proposal where I notice that it it's got

00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:30,059
a trans man and trans woman in in

00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:32,699
addition to male and female so I think

00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:35,029
all of us coming from various parts of

00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:38,129
the world and being a part of a lot of

00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:40,439
community work need to understand that

00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:42,959
there is serious need for gender

00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:44,970
diversity in our communities and work

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:50,119
towards a rather map towards an

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:50,119
inclusive osm and thank you

00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,810
if anybody's got ideas suggestions I'd

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:07,170
love to chat I'll be here for the rest

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,170
for today and for the next two days yeah

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,810
this is great thank you I really like

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,480
your approach over all I want to geek

00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:28,030
out with you later to two things to pay

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,830
attention to if you would like out of

00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,270
the Center for civic media at the MIT

00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,550
Media Lab they've been doing a lot of

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,560
work around gender and data that might

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,440
help speed up your process so there's

00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:43,660
the open gender tracker which is a way

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:46,120
of running usually names like the proper

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,490
names as opposed to user names to

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,940
automatically classify and then tag for

00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,560
specific instances or exceptions and the

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,020
other is they do a lot of work around

00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,910
queer data like what is it to not have a

00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,500
gender binary but to have other options

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,820
as well and they would be great to talk

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,670
to and they would be enthusiastic about

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:09,100
that definitely thank you and you're

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:10,960
gonna introduce her um thank thanks so

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,970
much for your talking for your research

00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,680
and so you heard I think you wrapped my

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,690
session yesterday yeah I did some data

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,130
research too so what I'm really excited

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,420
about is that we're both thinking about

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,420
metrics and I think we're not alone

00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,720
of course in the past and will be in the

00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,660
future and it's important important

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:05,070
cause but I think it's also a course

00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:11,780
where you have to sort of it's easy to

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:16,500
kind of well be a bit a little bit too -

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:19,230
to do too much marketing and when used

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,150
when you showed your initial thing about

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,010
the toilets your map where you counted

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,900
the toilets in India I immediately

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,740
thought well something's wrong about

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:31,260
this and I went through osm and counted

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:37,380
the note and yes you're right there are

00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:40,110
about 800 toilets in India and only 35

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,200
of them are marked as female but only 38

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:46,110
of them are marked as male so there's

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,580
not really that your your picture if you

00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,590
see the picture it immediately looks

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,890
like oh my god

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:55,230
women are so this probe disproportionate

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:58,860
in our semen and data for women is

00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:01,560
lacking but it's it's really well there

00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:06,000
are the majority of toilets or have no

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:08,490
marker no male or female and just a tiny

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,920
fraction of them are marked as either

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,600
male toilets or female toilets so I

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,580
think you were kind of you were a little

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,250
bit misrepresenting things there because

00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,800
your map looks like oh my god OS M is

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,540
not catering to females at all when in

00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,240
fact the message should have been well

00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:27,090
OS m is not going into as much detail as

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,130
it should not marking toilets with the

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:32,820
gender properly but it's not like

00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:35,280
there's only a fraction of female

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,590
toilets and compared to male toilets so

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,620
that's just a minor thing and and it's

00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,870
easy to get to you and this is things

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,030
like that get retweeted and retold and

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,580
then we are we have press that says oh

00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,440
my god women are so underrepresented and

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,480
it's and it's important to get the facts

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,900
right and I don't want people to say

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,090
that only like female toilets are a

00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,680
factor 10 to one compared to male

00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,250
toilets in India because that wouldn't

00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,490
be correct

00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,520
very true I agree but I'd also like to

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,059
add that

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,300
at least in the case of India I think

00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:13,030
either women tile female toilets are not

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,420
paying mark or not enough care is being

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:18,100
taken to additionally tack them is

00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:21,630
usable for female and coming from India

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:25,809
I can vouch that any that every other

00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:28,510
toilet is probably for guys and unless a

00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:31,660
girl knows that she can actually use it

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:34,030
it is it's always never a given I

00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,160
understand that overall the data has to

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,230
be tagged well and better than what we

00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,350
have right now I was just calling out

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:44,080
specifically in this case to to sort of

00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:46,450
reiterate the need for what we have to

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:55,690
work towards anything you'd like to

00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:58,390
write thank you thank you so much for

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,780
doing that study and I really like your

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:04,960
examples very much I don't think I think

00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:08,500
that the lack of putting an explicit

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,950
name on it is a very important issue the

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:14,500
fact that you know we can't easily get

00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,179
the statistics I think we need to enlist

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,740
the support of some very brilliant

00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:19,630
people who are there are many of in this

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:23,740
room to make sure that we can improve

00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:27,309
the tracking and you know I think this

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,900
is true of many organizations I worked

00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:32,380
for a professional society where we

00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:36,370
didn't even track that ten years ago and

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:38,710
no ethnicity data no racial data no none

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,390
of that so it's something that I think

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,200
as an organization grows we definitely

00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,200
need to pay attention to

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,520
you

00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:51,650
Oh a lot my analysis looks at these tags

00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,960
and data from a gender perspective I

00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,790
have not looked at it from from a

00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,000
regional perspective to understand if

00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:01,910
it's to understand the Western influence

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,950
maybe if I look or if we do a study on

00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:13,540
it probably together we should be able

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:13,540
to find something any more questions

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,960
thanks very much for the presentation

00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,210
just a brief comment a lot of us in this

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,070
room worked for employers where we're

00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,500
either paid to work on OS m or it

00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,300
relates to our job so I think we all

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,880
have a role to play in terms of actual

00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,500
hiring practices in influencing the

00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,780
direction of hiring practices in our

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,700
workplaces and I think that through

00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,500
that's one of many methods through which

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:53,780
we can contribute to addressing this so

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:56,350
thank you okay okay if there are no more

00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,350
