OSM is a global community and yet not diverse in the gender aspect. Though considerable effort has gone into introducing more women to the community, the transformation of newcomers into long standing contributors to the community doesnâ€™t happen automatically. There seems to be need for dedicated efforts to help novice women gain their foothold in the domain.

Based on her efforts and experiments to improve the diversity of the community, Srravya will propose three specific guidelines as a first step for communities to provide a congenial environment for women to be active participants. The talk will also touch upon the importance of participation from all genders and not just women. The aim is not just to promote and increase participation of women but to evolve as a truly open and diverse community with participants from all and any gender.
