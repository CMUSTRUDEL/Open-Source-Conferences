The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an important data privacy law that comes into effect on May 25, 2018.

SotM will be two months after the beginning of GDPR implementation. The Legal/Licensing Working Group has been hard at work to prepare OSM for this new law and hopes to use the opportunity to explain GDPR and its impact on OSM, how OSMF has been responding, answer questions, and assist OSM projects maintainers.

This session will be targeted to helping OSM community projects that use personal data understand GDPR compliance, in particular the mechanisms that OSMF will be putting into place to facilitate compliance.

Anticipated structure:
GDPR basics
Why GDPR matters to OSM
How OSMF is implementing GDPR
GDPR's impact on community projects
OSMF's template agreement
Tips for your project complying with GDPR
Walkthrough of specific project example

also GDP itemization all right

00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:26,090
Foundation and so if you are not

00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:35,900
familiar with lwg we're working group

00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:39,400
that deals with four and also various

00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,350
legal issues that affect this community

00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,980
in particular what we're going to talk

00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,290
about today is piracy longer if you are

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,199
interested in learning more about the

00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:54,110
various working groups of OS FF there is

00:00:51,199 --> 00:01:01,939
a session at 5:40 today in the main room

00:00:54,110 --> 00:01:08,450
where you can learn about joining the

00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:11,360
lwg has been working on getting OS mm

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:16,280
ready or shooting PRF for almost a year

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:19,460
now and so I am NOT a privacy learner in

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,310
my day I'm actually I'm just aware and

00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,520
part of the process of helping oh I

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:28,159
found that Freddy I did quite a bit of

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,039
research talking to experts about what

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,920
we should do and so today I am going to

00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:41,109
walk all of you through what we learn

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,109
and what we what OSF has planned

00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:52,270
so this is sort of our agenda for today

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:56,600
first I'm gonna give you context about

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:58,700
about gdpr and its general impacts then

00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:05,020
I'm going to give you a crash course on

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:08,869
what the law says and then describe what

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:11,810
working on all the side what's next on

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:15,680
the horizon for our plans and then go

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:19,480
over some questions both the term party

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:24,560
fanaticism also from the audience

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:30,260
okay so what did you hear is during camp

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:32,959
privacy law I it affects so it is a very

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:38,269
complicated why it went you into effect

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,400
on May 25th of this year and it has a

00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:44,140
lot of parts that's what makes it

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,380
complicated what makes it difficult to

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:51,549
follow all the parts of the regulation

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:54,590
and the penalties are can be very stiff

00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:58,160
needless to say OS mm does not have very

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,959
much light so we would be nowhere close

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:09,560
to being able to afford the penalties

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:11,030
should the regulator's so this I told

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,510
these quotes from a couple of news

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:18,230
articles that surveyed what companies

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,920
were doing about GDP are shortly before

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:25,160
May 25th so the one that I found most

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,600
striking was that in January so five

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,090
months before

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,850
our day a quarter of London businesses

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:36,500
didn't know what it was

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:43,780
so maybe they just they had no idea that

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:48,350
this there was seen a lot coming and

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:53,150
also again looking at some articles

00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:56,870
before companies were really struggling

00:03:53,150 --> 00:04:02,150
with implementing procedures that

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:04,430
conform to GDP are a Microsoft

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,510
apparently supposedly got 300 engineers

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,070
working on it

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,930
I encourage some let's say that they

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:14,210
have a hundred lawyers also working on

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:17,210
it for OS MF we are all volunteers we

00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:20,440
don't have these kind of resources but

00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,440
we are trying our best

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,700
the the other thing that was really

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,490
striking was that the data protection

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,550
authorities which in the EU are supposed

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,970
to be enforcing jus GPR they were not

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:39,170
ready either so this article was from

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,970
three days before May 25th and so it's

00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:45,080
referencing a survey from one month

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:48,200
before GDP are going to effect and the

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,390
17 of the 20 for my years of data

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,200
protection authorities were not ready

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,200
for GPR

00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:07,709
so it hasn't so this is uh this is

00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:16,860
basically a summary of what things were

00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:19,649
like for gage money then and after you

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,909
know it's been about two months but

00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:26,159
things are not a lot better because we

00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:31,050
saw a rash of complaints that were filed

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:33,059
on May 25th month may 26 but the dead

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,050
protection authorities have not really

00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:41,069
acted on that yet it historically it has

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:44,219
taken you know sir he used enforcement

00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:47,129
agencies you know up to a year at least

00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:50,309
you know something like six implants to

00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:53,039
really you know put out any decisions so

00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:55,139
right now at the two month mark we

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,459
haven't gotten those decisions and those

00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,089
decisions are really sort of the

00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:02,909
guidance us that everybody who's a

00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:06,089
factor if I do you care we need so right

00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:10,319
now we don't really know very much okay

00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:16,619
so now we go to what the law actually

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:19,969
says so first what is this gdpr sampler

00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:24,479
I general data protection regulation

00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:27,629
this down so simple I it consists of 11

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:31,019
chapters there are 99 articles and total

00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:34,169
it's 88 pages that's not kind of the

00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:36,659
recitals which are sort of the little

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,020
descriptions they gave of some things if

00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:40,530
you would like to read it

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,720
please go ahead this is the leak

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:46,410
everywhere if you just want to assembly

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,410
you could just keep listening

00:06:49,860 --> 00:07:03,849
so GDP art was really a way to try to

00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:07,780
codify these basic principle and you

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:12,070
know I think we can all agree that these

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,810
are things that make sense that I you

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,080
know if you want to have privacy

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:22,000
protection these are important things to

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:25,000
consider when when using that but as

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,870
we'll see when we kind of get to the

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,210
details these are the guiding principles

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,210
that the details can be very complicated

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:41,139
okay so first off one common

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,940
misconception is I'm not European I'm

00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:46,800
not interviewed this doesn't affect me

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:49,990
now we are Italy so we're in the EU but

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:55,150
she did PR affects everyone who gets

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:58,150
personal data from a new resident so

00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,219
even if you are a company that is

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,849
outside the EU if you have any in

00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:11,020
customers if you are OSM and you have a

00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:12,849
team effort GDP are affects you and the

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:17,680
definition of personal data is very very

00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:19,750
broad so it's any data of that even if

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,389
the individual piece of data does not

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,449
identify a person if it the pieces

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:27,150
collectively identify a person then

00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:30,060
that's considered personal down

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:33,779
we know from sort of the guidance that

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,690
was given before May 25th that the

00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:39,169
things like your name your email your IP

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,810
address are definitely personal down

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:45,690
there hasn't really been as much

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:49,140
guidance given to sort of at what level

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:52,140
you know beyond you know less precise

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:57,870
level I it stops being considered

00:08:52,140 --> 00:09:04,339
personal data and this is looking for

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:06,510
people like real people not your

00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:10,740
companies that it is not considered

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:12,779
persona okay the other thing about you

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,529
keep your that's a pretty broad is what

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:19,670
it covers

00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:22,470
so processing is pretty much anything

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,630
any sort of Internet activity is going

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:28,650
to involve processing storage or

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:34,520
transfer it's pretty much using the data

00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:37,800
at all so there are a couple of

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,260
exemptions from the law so a big one is

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,110
personal household activities that's

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,540
basically your personal address book the

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,480
recycle said that your personal social

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:51,490
media is

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:57,910
quitter but that the platform is not

00:09:51,490 --> 00:10:01,029
exempt and then there are what are

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:05,199
considered acceptable reasons for

00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:07,329
processing data so legitimate interests

00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:08,800
is one that we will be talking about in

00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:13,269
a lot more detail because it's very

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:17,199
important to OSM another one is consent

00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:20,470
but it has to be very clear consent that

00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:25,630
is expressly given I you can't sort of

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:27,639
hide it on the back page you know people

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:32,110
have to really sort check the box to

00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:34,899
give it it can't be assumed performance

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,639
of a contract is for example if you buy

00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:39,339
something from a company and they have

00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,570
to ship it to you well you have to you

00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:44,639
have to give up your address in order

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,639
for that transaction to be completed

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:56,339
there are extra restrictions on certain

00:10:50,769 --> 00:11:00,579
categories of data one is for minors and

00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:02,529
another is for sensitive categories of

00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:06,190
data for example what your religion is

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:08,860
your medical information fortunately we

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:11,550
don't wait to have that as a normal data

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,550
type in

00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:21,610
another part of the regulation that's a

00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:24,420
transparency is a big partner right so

00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:28,060
for an experience II this means tell me

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:31,149
people that are you are getting data

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,250
from what you are collecting why you are

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,440
collecting it and what you are doing

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:39,399
with it

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,709
so the disclosure requirements typically

00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:48,450
show up as people including those active

00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:51,630
information on a privacy policy another

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:55,029
important part of the regulation that

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,800
affects OSF is something that is

00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:01,060
colloquially called the right to be

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:06,779
forgotten it's really about a right to

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:10,480
have data deleted but this part is key I

00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:14,110
this right is only absolute when the

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,709
basis of processing is on consent so you

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:19,870
can withdraw your consent at any time

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:22,870
but if you have a there is another

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:26,470
lawful basis for example the generate

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:30,520
interest then whether the needs data

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:32,170
needs to be deleted I depends on sort of

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,500
this you go back to the regular

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:38,260
evaluation of legitimate interest versus

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,180
the person's interest in having the dive

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,180
deleted and there is a balancing

00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:54,810
for transfers any transfers to another

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:58,720
country must follow certain regulations

00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:03,160
and there is a list of approved

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,639
jurisdictions where the transfer has

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,920
been deemed acceptable because the

00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:11,949
country that the data was going to is

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:21,089
considered to have sufficient privacy

00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:23,319
protection and then there are also some

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:25,360
contractual documents that you've

00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:28,480
assigned to promised that you would

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:35,170
adhere to sort of a heightened standard

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:38,620
of privacy all right so now I'm gonna

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:43,389
talk about what LSMs has been doing in

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:49,420
life of that long list of things that

00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:51,639
have to be considered so these are sort

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,050
of the things that we were thinking

00:13:51,639 --> 00:14:00,009
about as we went into this process

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:04,569
obviously a data and open data is very

00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:07,809
important to osm we want to keep data

00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:11,040
open as possible within the bounds of

00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:15,420
the law another consideration

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,570
where does osm or oh it's MF have

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:22,649
personal data people are not supposed to

00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:28,019
save on the map this is my house but

00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:30,930
yeah you know that is a possibility and

00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:35,190
then of course there is information like

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:38,459
our usernames that you know if anybody

00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:41,940
could go and go and see that on the

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:46,500
website there is some personal data that

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:49,889
louis emma has memberships or when you

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,690
sign up for an account with OS m because

00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:55,050
we don't they're not allow an online

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:57,569
editing and then there's were the social

00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:01,440
aspects of Louis F which you know like

00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:05,009
state of the map but also mapping

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,199
parties and local meetups where you know

00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:10,649
backwards want to get come together and

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:15,110
get to know each other and how does all

00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:19,579
of that fit in with this very protective

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,579
about your personal data

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,560
so just so you can see I'm not going to

00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:29,899
read they're all of those things quite a

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:36,410
bit but this is sort of how this has

00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:40,339
come together over time the working

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:47,089
groups and the board have been thinking

00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:52,160
about this and explore a lot asked

00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:53,930
experts and done research and then you

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,720
know went back to the community several

00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:02,360
points to get box and we are we're still

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,079
still going through some of this process

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,079
which I'll talk about

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:21,740
so we'll be concluded so the first part

00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:27,970
is really important this is how we fit

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:34,010
with GDP our legitimate interest is

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:39,500
appropriate for an organization that

00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:45,020
goal is to have a widely available yet

00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:48,830
accurate map osm that's purposes are

00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:52,010
different than a lot of sort of the

00:16:48,830 --> 00:17:00,520
companies that were the target of GDP

00:16:52,010 --> 00:17:03,350
are and because of that we have we have

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:09,020
justifications that don't necessarily

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:14,690
apply to everyone the legitimate basis

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:21,020
allows us to not have to change so much

00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:24,260
and not have to lock up so much that is

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,990
so important to the community we did

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:31,510
find that there were some things that we

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:35,840
felt like we needed to tweak in order to

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:38,860
do more there is the white paper that is

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,480
available it's been available for

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,700
several months now but if you haven't

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,190
seen the message go out to the service

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,280
and such and you want to read about all

00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,130
of the research that was done it's sort

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,760
of the summary of the conclusions

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:57,980
there's a link here I and these I will

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,120
put these slides out so you don't try to

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,120
capture all of this right now

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:12,779
so this is sort of the things that we in

00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:19,899
looking at the law we determine effect

00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:25,539
OS I'm probably so the first of the

00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:29,110
privacy policy which may or may not have

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:34,389
seen when we did an updated privacy

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:37,440
policy to account for the parts of GDP

00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:43,360
are that required certain disclosures

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:51,490
about the data the OSF has and what it's

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:56,679
used for previously some of this data

00:18:51,490 --> 00:19:04,539
was in sort of documentation for the API

00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:07,000
is or for or Theo's awarded in a very

00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:10,620
technical manner and not all subsidized

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,620
so now

00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:23,960
so the these are still in draft form the

00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:29,090
new terms of use the main purpose of the

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:33,650
new terms of use is to expressly limit

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:36,710
use of personal data that is in map data

00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:42,559
that is in the data that

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:49,490
osm has to the uses that would fit the

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:52,880
legitimate interest of Awesome the other

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:56,539
pieces we so basically you know you are

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,789
not supposed to use osm data to go stalk

00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:02,270
someone and i think that the community a

00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:06,350
large party understands that but it was

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:08,659
not expressly written out that you

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:12,169
cannot do this and if you do this you

00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:15,770
will get damn right we will we will we

00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:19,610
will block you from access you know same

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:22,100
thing where we have policies about you

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:26,600
know don't use sources that are not

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:30,559
appropriate don't spam the email

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:34,580
listserv and things like that but they

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:38,120
weren't you know all in a document where

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:41,940
everyone who is editing the mouth and

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:54,570
getting this data you know agrees yes

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:56,910
I'm going to live by so the this is I

00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:02,760
think like the really important part

00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:08,990
which is that in order to support osm

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:11,550
and support a world wide open map the

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,560
mappers in general the community of

00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:17,430
large not just were like a very limited

00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:21,020
set people have to be able to have to

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:24,690
know that you know someone is mapping

00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:29,400
somewhere that they mapped other things

00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:32,190
and to be able to communicate so you

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,230
know for example say you see and ended

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,590
someone in in has inserted some curse

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:42,050
words into a scripting well in order to

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:44,520
you know for us to have efficiency in

00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:47,010
having an accurate map you're gonna want

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,850
to know okay wait did this was this an

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:54,900
accident or is this somebody who is full

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:57,210
who is you know throwing things out

00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,580
there what else does this person edited

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:02,220
right you needed to know you need to go

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,070
to see sort of all of the edits of this

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:09,240
person is this person you has has been

00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:12,060
person been at this for a while right if

00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,100
somebody has edited something and

00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:18,090
there's a question as to whether they

00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:20,820
used an authorised source you want to be

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,640
able to message that person say where

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:28,110
did you get this you know did you did

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:30,120
you copy this from somewhere and here

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,090
if they don't respond you may have to

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,730
look okay where else has this person

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:40,019
edited you know are these other edits

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:41,909
also from suspects and sources or maybe

00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:43,890
a but there's a respondent says oh this

00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:46,500
was from here that this other something

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:51,140
is not right that is all very important

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,140
to having a map

00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,830
and of course we have a lot of what

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:04,320
personal data in OSF is used for is to

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:07,350
sort of support the overall community

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:15,540
and able to do being able to do these

00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:19,580
things efficiently so as I said we want

00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:23,490
to make sure that personal data is

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:27,300
protected and not abused so the main

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:30,720
ways that we're looking at that is to

00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,550
make sure everybody agrees that they're

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,420
not going to abuse this that up before

00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:39,720
they access to it now the easy way to do

00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,940
that is already there are a lot of

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,470
things where you have to be logged in to

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:50,490
do including edit and so the idea is

00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:53,880
that in order to have access to the

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,710
metadata fields that contain personal

00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,990
data especially things like user name

00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:03,090
user ID you're gonna have to be logged

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:08,010
in and have agreed to the new terms you

00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:10,080
that OS mmmph it's also story I see

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,480
addresses for a long short amount of

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,910
time and doing masking so we don't have

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:20,100
nearly as much of that as we did before

00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:23,300
and a lot of this is sort of formalizing

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,300
with the custom

00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:35,799
so things that are not changing so the

00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:39,220
your email has always been in generally

00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:40,960
private though admins of course have

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,360
asked us because we need to be able to

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:50,409
contact anyone who edits about their

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:55,860
edits but but that's not out there for

00:24:50,409 --> 00:25:02,159
everyone to have IP addresses are also

00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:07,320
limited to their operations reasons and

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,320
then you can of course choose to share

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:26,810
so if you know we hope to not have to

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:35,030
change too much for the community at

00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:37,040
large if you use OSF data in a map if

00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,260
you are sort of using into it not to

00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:42,410
dude

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:45,290
you probably won't see any changes the

00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:53,090
there shouldn't be personal data in the

00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:57,590
geographic data itself if you are sort

00:25:53,090 --> 00:26:02,570
of it an editor you you know you already

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:06,260
need to be logged in to edit so we are

00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:09,310
hoping to be able to work with the

00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:13,460
maintainer of the various editing tools

00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:18,260
so that it's stainless between now and

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:20,930
when this is all fully implemented that

00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,000
you sort of agree once to the Terms of

00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:28,190
Use introduction with like the OSF

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:32,120
website and the login notes that you

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:34,750
have agreed and you never have to worry

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,750
about it again

00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:48,149
so just as sort of an example here big

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:52,889
we OS OS I'm cha is a data validation

00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:55,500
point where you can sort of do filters

00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:59,120
to see I you know

00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:03,299
let's see everything edited in this area

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:06,440
by one mapper or let's look at change

00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:10,350
sent by changed a and it's in an area

00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,659
and it can be very helpful there's

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,190
another talked about all the details

00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:19,230
about some time we can be very

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:21,210
comfortable and catching problems but

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:34,529
the hope is to sort of integrate the

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:38,129
login into OSF top so another example

00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:43,220
you know to see how fellows efforts have

00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:51,779
mapped and to see who is nearby it

00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:54,509
really helpful to the community members

00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:58,139
and to work together yeah that's sort of

00:27:54,509 --> 00:28:00,500
what we're all here for and tools like

00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:05,309
this they all help us find each other

00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:09,269
but again we have to be careful not that

00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:11,419
these tools are not used the stalks of

00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,419
it

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:23,590
another legitimate interest according to

00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:27,310
the art is research and which was

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:34,750
certainly an important how the community

00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:39,370
uses OSM and it's a generally fairly

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:42,390
straightforward to not use the data for

00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:47,620
any purpose that would be contrary to

00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:49,360
the dance video to the new terms the the

00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,340
only thing researchers I think there we

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,010
have to be careful about it should not

00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:58,840
further share that data without a

00:28:54,010 --> 00:29:01,270
promise from the recipient that they are

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,250
going to follow the same rules or they

00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:08,850
can sort of use summaries and share the

00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:08,850
summaries that don't have any personal

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:20,840
so thinking keep in mind for community

00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:25,730
projects is that if you processed or

00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:27,710
store personal data the you know even if

00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:32,630
you when you have this sort of just a

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:36,380
copy of the personal data that osm that

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:39,860
makes you a controller under the law and

00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:45,110
that means that you have to follow these

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:51,230
rules as well so you know if you if you

00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:55,850
are running a project then you know what

00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:58,940
we you know hoping to be able to help

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:01,210
you which is the operative words and

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,210
such

00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:17,890
so as I said the terms that you have

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:20,960
been drafted but they have not yet been

00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:25,400
implemented so there's no discussion

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:28,700
about exactly what they say community

00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:32,810
discussion board discussion before there

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:39,170
will be a vote and then of course the

00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:40,160
technical implementation the the I don't

00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,590
know if you've heard about the server

00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:46,220
room but the operations working group

00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:49,760
has been very busy lately so this is

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:52,220
probably the next big project from a

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,910
technical standpoint so we're probably

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,500
looking at a couple of months out and

00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:02,030
there will be communication that's going

00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:11,720
out on the server and as well as some

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:14,350
diagnosis and then you know there's some

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,770
other things that we hope that we will

00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:23,780
be able to do down the road as well good

00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:28,150
in terms of helping the community with

00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,150
GPR and its requirements

00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:45,210
okay so we have I'm going to try to

00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:48,990
address a few questions that people

00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:56,909
usually have and then after I do that

00:31:48,990 --> 00:32:03,120
I'll open it up to the floor okay so if

00:31:56,909 --> 00:32:08,760
you are just using a map that is based

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:11,970
on osm this GDP our changes will

00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:17,210
probably not affect you the license is

00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:22,039
still owed EBL and there shouldn't be

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,039
personal data and and what you have

00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:33,510
if you are an editor if you are a mapper

00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:37,560
this should not affect your

00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:40,800
contributions to the map as I said some

00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:47,640
of the metadata that is not me is likely

00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:50,760
to be personal data well the subject to

00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:55,010
the new Terms of Use but hopefully none

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,010
of us dominates anyway so

00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:07,900
so this is sort of the list of what we

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:12,460
think the metadata that is likely to

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:15,660
contain personal data is so basically

00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:19,240
this is uh we're looking at information

00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:23,200
that when you when you look at that set

00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:28,630
of information is likely to identify a

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:30,640
person so information about so you know

00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:33,580
user names obviously a lot completely

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,940
lose their name every user names or they

00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:39,340
might use the same user name as they do

00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:43,470
in social media on like another account

00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:45,760
for example pretty easy to find somebody

00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:48,030
information about a common person edits

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,160
can also be very very revealing

00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:54,730
especially if you have a person's

00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:59,260
history of edits a lot of times people

00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:01,090
start editing near home so if you you

00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,550
know look at a mappers and it's and you

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,040
sort of back to the beginning you might

00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:08,889
be able to see oh you know this this is

00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:12,190
probably their house or obviously they

00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:17,710
live before it when they started dating

00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:19,120
also if you you know often you can see

00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,290
you know this person probably who lives

00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,869
in this neighborhood because there

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:25,999
anything around this area and

00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:31,759
and comments can be things like oh you

00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:36,919
know I visited here on this day I saw

00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:43,730
this on the map so we are trying to

00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:46,429
ensure that that guy by making sure that

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:49,639
people have access to that have agreed

00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:52,369
to the new terms

00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:55,579
the one question their big question mark

00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:56,329
is tighten it because it can't be very

00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:59,480
revealing

00:34:56,329 --> 00:35:02,960
so I especially you have it down to a

00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:08,089
very high level of detail because you

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,289
can see if of all these guys and it's of

00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:11,809
all these changes were made at the same

00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:13,579
time that you can sort of correlate them

00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:17,240
together and say oh this was probably

00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:20,210
all one person especially as you are

00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:23,960
looking at an area that is not updated

00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:27,740
very frequently I can kind of say oh

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,799
this is kind of get a sense somebody was

00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:33,589
like walking around for example but at

00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:35,690
the same time timestamp is also very

00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:38,390
helpful if you just are trying to update

00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:40,249
them out and try to ingest the updates

00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:42,529
right do you have an application you're

00:35:40,249 --> 00:35:47,420
like okay I need today's I need today's

00:35:42,529 --> 00:35:50,900
edits and well you know you don't want

00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:53,960
to not know which ones are for today so

00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,180
which we're still figuring out how

00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,410
exactly

00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,410
it's going to be presented

00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:14,420
okay so if you have a project that is

00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:22,390
you that is likely to contain or slow

00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:27,439
data probably the easiest thing to do is

00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:30,259
to have you belong in it to have access

00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:31,880
to those fields it doesn't necessarily

00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:35,749
mean that people have to be launched in

00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:38,660
to have access to all fields if you want

00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:41,660
to sort of like you know have a tiered

00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:47,049
access so for example against the map

00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:49,099
itself in public the information about

00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:52,279
about the other groups of the mouth

00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:55,130
might be behind the login but that is

00:36:52,279 --> 00:37:01,249
probably going to be the easiest way of

00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:05,209
dealing with GPR the other view we are

00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:08,719
trying to provide some templates and

00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:10,640
some information so that you just fill

00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,929
in kind of fill it make it easier for

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,929
community projects

00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:25,200
okay so I hope we have some questions

00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:27,270
from the audience I will tell you that I

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,300
it says in the program that the session

00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:33,210
is not recorded but Brian over here is

00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,060
helpfully recording and hopefully we'll

00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:44,610
be able to get that video up sometime

00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:46,500
later just a clarification about the WG

00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,080
in the server room which is now done by

00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,250
the way there's probably almost no

00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,080
there's probably nothing though the

00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,780
leading genes to do all that is

00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,490
conceivable is allocate or storage space

00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,880
for what we've got two sets of planets

00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:00,720
but that's nothing that would be needed

00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,390
immediately

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,730
this on future so there's nothing

00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,730
waiting on the WGT for work

00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:22,850
while that's out the crew still has to

00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:25,730
be done yeah I was saying that the

00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:29,030
technical side that everyone's been very

00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:52,310
busy and so but not too much pressure on

00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:55,040
the I told us a lot about the data meter

00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:57,830
net have but what about the courage of

00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:04,420
GDP of all the data like contacts I

00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:10,610
receive a email address and compact so

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:14,150
osm up so we have emails for everyone

00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:16,820
who is a mapper those emails are not

00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,950
publicly available they never have been

00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:26,570
that's not changing

00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:31,700
I don't believe that people shop the

00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:38,860
contact address it sometimes mr. John

00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:43,100
Smith up the treatment plan yeah so

00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:47,750
stores are not considered persons yes

00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:52,100
it's possible for an individual phone

00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:57,140
number to be the same as the stores but

00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:59,030
but generally speaking a company so

00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:02,420
that's you know if it's a retail shop

00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:06,440
for example a company is not considered

00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:08,910
a natural person so even if lists of use

00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:13,500
is private military as a contact

00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:18,270
new members so the my view of it is is

00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:21,630
that the address is the address for the

00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:23,430
store because if for example the storm

00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:29,700
moved but the person still live there

00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:32,910
then the the address for the story moves

00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,890
with the new the you email address of

00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:38,660
the physical address the email address

00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:41,370
the email address should also be the

00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:44,010
even if the person likes Dunn's personal

00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:47,040
email from it but if you facility of a

00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:53,220
complex to email a process transmission

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:56,010
its private address I so I think that

00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:58,410
this is an area where the data

00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:03,630
authorities just simply have not given

00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:05,370
sufficient guidance and I think that you

00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:11,820
know maybe we'll see you more guidance

00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:14,150
on that down the road but for now it's a

00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,150
little bit

00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:29,270
hi so and you spoke about a potentially

00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:32,060
having different possible community

00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:35,390
projects are there any rules that you

00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:37,940
know about sort of humanitarian efforts

00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,650
you know in areas whether my example

00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:45,770
last year had the hurricanes and the

00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:47,690
Caribbean for example or so when I miss

00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:51,350
that I speaking about the meaning of

00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:56,180
products it was about people were using

00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:58,180
that not so humanitarian uses and I

00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,010
think would be another type of

00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,790
legitimate interest the other thing is

00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,790
that I

00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:16,130
gdpr it it is the law that protects the

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:18,890
privacy of eat you residence so if it is

00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:23,920
mapping in the Caribbean

00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:27,020
then gdpr may affect sort of like in the

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,270
metadata we have about the mappers so

00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,420
you know user your but that's not the

00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:36,200
same as having an effect on what is

00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:39,110
matte so I would expect it to not

00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:42,410
actually have very much effect or see a

00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:44,540
mapping in the Caribbean so I work very

00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,500
closely at that happen for a second

00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,510
there's something called a data

00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,680
protection impact assessment so anybody

00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:51,079
was doing that data

00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,400
my translation to that there's also

00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:53,900
something called the handbook for data

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,819
protection which goes through the

00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,290
guidelines of its own ensure our allies

00:43:55,819 --> 00:44:00,609
in the different planetary groups

00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:03,170
whether it's COF for hot or whatever

00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:08,210
I'm just going to say my understanding

00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:11,599
of genius on experimentation is if an

00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:14,300
email address is John Smith that

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,780
Microsoft comm that's still classed as a

00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,880
personal email address because an

00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,450
individual can be identified by that

00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,119
even though it's at their business

00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:28,099
address and that the only things that

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,710
don't classify are things like in their

00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:34,400
actual sales actual somehow that which

00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:36,890
is not personal specific right so I'm so

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,800
I have the same understanding but the

00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:42,410
kind of email address that in my mind is

00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,480
likely to be back sort of like you know

00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:45,950
this is the store right here's the name

00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,980
of the store the address of the store

00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:51,800
the website of the store and an email

00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:54,650
that email address is I think much more

00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,760
unlikely to be the more like info or

00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:00,710
sale type of email address that of

00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,559
course you know there are circumstances

00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:07,760
where if it is an individual's like

00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:11,349
little little retail shop where you you

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:15,349
know it is a little more gray I think

00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:18,500
but again you know we we we tell people

00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:20,869
you know don't put personal data into

00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:23,210
into the bath itself and then the other

00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:25,520
thing that we come across is trying to

00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:28,040
work out how to validate a genuine

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,599
request to remove data which is very

00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,299
tricky because then you have to be able

00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,270
to categorically identify the correct

00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:36,320
person has sent a request through me the

00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:39,550
information

00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:42,560
it's this altering of identity theft I

00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:45,530
don't know I still don't know about it

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:49,460
you know it is complicated I think your

00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:52,430
part of it is that it it's not very

00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:55,040
useful to the map to have something

00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:57,640
labeled so it's those house you know

00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:02,510
that's that's not that's not the purpose

00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:05,570
and I data working group has got

00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:09,380
historically gotten robust about please

00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:14,180
remove my house or you know remove my

00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:16,460
name and you know we'll we'll see if

00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:21,470
there's a rise and those kinds of

00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:23,330
requests with GDP are or not I say I

00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:26,840
said in the slide abouts really the

00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:31,100
right to be forgotten that right is

00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:35,690
really tied to consent so if we are

00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:38,600
looking at so for for osm we're looking

00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:40,610
at legitimate basis and so whether or

00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,890
not there's a legitimate basis for

00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:48,380
certain information to be on the map

00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:51,500
that review I think will continue the

00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:54,710
way it has because privacy of

00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:58,640
individuals has been something that DW

00:46:54,710 --> 00:47:00,410
does has looked at before and it sort of

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,830
remains to be seen whether there's going

00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,830
to be used

00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:12,030
but it just two things one personal

00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,700
remark about this email addressing this

00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:17,060
clause in GDP asset if you make an

00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:20,280
information manifestly public yourself

00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:22,320
then you lose any protection rights in

00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,330
this information so it's very much in

00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,980
line with our on-the-ground reading or

00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:27,930
if someone's putting out a sign as a

00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:31,050
mother conveys a measurement and that's

00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:33,180
a wide public then we can pick it up if

00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:35,580
it's not happy visible it shouldn't get

00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:38,130
in the database anyway so it's very much

00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:40,350
still in arms or practice and my

00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:43,230
question is more about doesn't make

00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:44,130
sense to have an Amish and DT mediating

00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,890
terms of yours

00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:48,810
through anybody or should we just still

00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:51,180
split it up into the terms of use

00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:55,350
appropriate for somebody just adding a

00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:57,660
boy and a bus to take about terms of use

00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:58,560
if people start want to start to use the

00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,900
make it a ten

00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,700
why not just split it up so that we have

00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,850
two levels and have a more probability

00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:11,670
ensure that people actually really read

00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:15,000
the Terms of Use it's just an agreement

00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:15,359
I mean it's it's a change in the user

00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,750
interface

00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,359
after a metaphor and you have to convert

00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:24,750
information through the logic system

00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:26,490
it's technically possible so and once I

00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:28,500
would put here every arts and in six

00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,990
months but the threes never sent on

00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,950
schedule

00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,540
if it's only is a question about

00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,310
technical implementation I think it's

00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,380
more a question of if you want it

00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:52,980
I would prefer personally but sure I'm

00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:54,869
not sure I'm not sure if I read the

00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:57,350
latest version of the draft it's a month

00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:57,350
ago or so

00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:03,090
that the things so there's sort of two

00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:04,680
sections to the draft Terms of Use

00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:07,800
there's one section that's really

00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:10,770
focused on GPR and sort of wooded or

00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:14,130
appropriate uses and then there's

00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:16,170
another section that is described you

00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:17,730
sort of other things that we per missed

00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:20,220
or actually prohibited like spam and

00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:24,720
things like that so the thing with

00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:28,170
having a Terms of Use is you do want it

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,930
to get clued all the things that are

00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:32,280
prohibited because if you don't know

00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,330
someone's going to come back later and

00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,010
say wait a minute you didn't say

00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:39,630
anything about this and then an argue

00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:42,150
about that the only thing is that even

00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:46,550
if somebody doesn't have a community

00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:48,960
project of any kind terms of the

00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:51,450
restrictions that are instead are going

00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,600
to be in the news residues is that you

00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:56,100
can't give this data to somebody else

00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:59,220
who's going to go use it in an

00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:01,110
inappropriate way so any individual

00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:03,660
could theoretically do that once they

00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:06,270
have access so part of the reason of

00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:09,930
including all of that is to sort of

00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:12,930
include this you don't try to get around

00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:16,920
the terms of use is also a violation of

00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:19,590
the okay just from West Quebec so if you

00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:22,080
don't exhibit the data to those we

00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:31,740
haven't kicked the extra box so we are

00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:33,630
fine aren't we okay there was to spirit

00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,520
about and to have an extra force to take

00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:37,350
to see the data so even if you're not

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,840
count an account but hasn't kicked the

00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:43,580
boss then you can each project cannot

00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,580
see another person's person at a time

00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,100
[Music]

00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:49,710
I'm just talking about the not a small

00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:52,530
number of users who have just one just a

00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:53,910
toy or something really simple that

00:51:52,530 --> 00:52:04,109
don't need interaction with other

00:51:53,910 --> 00:52:06,440
mappers different difficulties something

00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:09,330
that we might touch on

00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,310
I have some more questions but before I

00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:13,890
ask the question I want to say on behalf

00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:15,120
of the u.s. network you wish thank you

00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:17,430
through the licensed working before

00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,110
getting them all this because it would

00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:21,440
have fallen on our shoulders otherwise

00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,440
and

00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,520
the huge amount of drug and I really

00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:44,900
appreciate what you've done then and

00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:47,210
complete for making the presentation the

00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,160
small question that I have is now we're

00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:51,079
putting out the planet file all the time

00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,390
and we say this is under the old EDM

00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:56,630
license and the only piano license has a

00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:58,400
clear wording about you cannot add extra

00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,650
conditions to something that is not the

00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,510
OTP else you cannot say this isn't

00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:04,609
already bill but you must look to who

00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:08,630
you must not stop people with this data

00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:11,299
it's not allowed in the only way also so

00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:14,210
this will probably mean that we'll have

00:53:11,299 --> 00:53:17,569
to somehow find a way to say okay here's

00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:19,849
this file but only half of it is under

00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:23,029
ldbl and the other half the like user

00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:25,970
names and maybe timestamps are not under

00:53:23,029 --> 00:53:29,329
the ldbl but have these extra conditions

00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:31,309
is that happy yourself if they're legal

00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:36,980
they know that we can use to accomplish

00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:39,410
that so it's not quite that so what

00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:43,609
we're doing what we will be doing is

00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:45,890
that title is still under a bill but in

00:53:43,609 --> 00:53:48,770
order to have access to the file you

00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:50,750
have to agree to the terms so you sort

00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:55,510
of make this contractual agreement with

00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:58,460
terms in order to get access to the file

00:53:55,510 --> 00:54:00,950
does that make sense so there's two

00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:02,570
different files what about the metadata

00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:05,120
right and then

00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:07,670
with the medevac and origin yet the

00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:10,990
metadata or to let physically have

00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:15,080
access you need to agree to the terms so

00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:19,190
so you do that and then you get the file

00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:21,890
so the limitations are not in the file

00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:25,240
itself there's something that you agree

00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:25,240
to before you can have access

00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:32,980
I'm gonna I'm just thinking and without

00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:34,750
my community if I get the part to do

00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:37,539
some F and I say yes I want you to stalk

00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:39,549
someone now I have an O ppl file and put

00:54:37,539 --> 00:54:43,089
that on my website say someone else

00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:44,440
comes along and grabs it doesn't say you

00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:46,690
don't have a checkbox and then they

00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,380
stalk someone well you can't put it on

00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,640
your website

00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,680
yeah but you can't collect the stuff

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,230
that's kind of I'm saying he's have a go

00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:56,410
me and then developers that come to me

00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:58,029
is that well it's so so first right

00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:59,859
would be a violation of the terms for

00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:03,039
you to put it on the website without any

00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:07,529
profession of course and then if you're

00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:11,740
if somebody you know uses this you know

00:55:07,529 --> 00:55:14,200
it is not easy to catch every single

00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:16,930
violation under Terms of Use right of

00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,319
course it is certainly possible that

00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:22,779
somebody could violate the Terms of Use

00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:29,769
and then provide the data to somebody

00:55:22,779 --> 00:55:33,430
who then uses it inappropriately the OSM

00:55:29,769 --> 00:55:34,119
F does not have the capability to stop a

00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:38,289
stalker

00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:41,500
that's what the police are for really we

00:55:38,289 --> 00:55:45,009
what we want to do is cut off access so

00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:48,819
if you give the information to somebody

00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:52,420
all we can do and only have ever been

00:55:48,819 --> 00:55:55,720
able to do is to cut off future access

00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:57,609
and so we would cut off that's bad bad

00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,059
bad actors future actions by cutting off

00:55:57,609 --> 00:56:00,059
direct

00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:26,809
where it says which

00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:40,539
explicitly so and so these are the

00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:58,450
[Music]

00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:58,450
so I think these are probably yes

00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:35,240
[Music]

00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:35,240
I don't see enough discuss this

00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:38,970
that was it

00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,950
right

00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:55,960
so yeah if you want more information

00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:59,830
some links about the information that

00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:06,490
those enough has already put out and you

00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:10,200
can also email the LOV G though of

00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:10,200
