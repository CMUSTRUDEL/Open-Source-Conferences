maps maps maps it might be the last time

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,929
you hear me say that for a while because

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,150
sadly our conference is coming to an end

00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:14,940
but I've got love announcements to make

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,000
and we've got a lot of people to thank

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,470
and also through the awards that's one

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,050
way we thank our community so I hope

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,689
you've enjoyed the conference it's been

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,199
very packed we've heard lots of things

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,630
about data validation data kind of types

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,700
and how we might change it or if we're

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,680
going to turn off the map and we've

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,170
heard lots about the community and

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,829
different countries and I'm trying to

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,600
sum up all the talks the workshops the

00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:47,430
discussion groups but really I'm not

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,129
going to be able to summarize all the

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:55,440
topics of that but we've seen some great

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:58,109
maps as well so I haven't in there's an

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,180
announcement for weekly OpenStreetMap

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,969
and I believe I have someone to come up

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:13,619
and tell us a new language that they are

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:16,740
launching now thank you thank you yes so

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:20,080
we won't be launching a new language and

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,540
with larium and that is Swahili

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,540
[Applause]

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,120
so this is the language that is spoken

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:34,650
by over 80 million people in Tanzania

00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,630
Kenya Uganda DRC Rhondda Burundi so I'm

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,270

going to bail to understand and read

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,580

financing enough money first scholars to

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,239
come people who wouldn't be able to make

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,910
it without the financial support and

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,920
they they you know the conference takes

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,170
a lot of voluntary time but also cost

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,910
with venue and catering so can we have a

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,610

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:42,870
in part by the OpenStreetMap foundation

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,080
and the local chapter which is part of

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,390
wikimedia italia local chapters are

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,959
great for the foundation for running

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,810
stuff locally an organization we have a

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,810
welcome to a new local chapter which i

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,269
think they're going to come up and some

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,060
of the directors of the foundation board

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,030

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:16,930
belgium chapter

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:19,040
[Applause]

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:23,660
would you do you want to do it in front

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,870
of a banner they don't have me cuz I'm

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:30,170
only involved in the conference but my

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,650
time is part of the foundation and are

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:42,950
we going to let them be a local chapter

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:46,220
yes it's well that's good so so we do

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:51,290
Eaton I think striking hands is the it's

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:54,560
good I think I think you shake hands or

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:57,640
shake hands and and I think Michaels

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,640
taking of her first

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:14,349
then there's the formalities so we're

00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,889
we're welcoming OpenStreetMap Belgium

00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:19,919
and being a local chapter is really

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:23,860
important to the foundation and also to

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,900
local groups themselves for for boring

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,550
reasons and interesting reasons I think

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,280
one of the most interesting reasons is

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,110
to really kind of assert your your

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,370
alliance with OpenStreetMap foundation

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:38,560
and also yeah to kind of be part of that

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,860
be part of the growing kind of network

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,350
of local groups that that that that form

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,850
form OpenStreetMap worldwide so I'm

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,800
really excited to welcome yet another

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,470
local chapter and I'm hoping to welcome

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,360

00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:11,590

00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:15,789
later before he he flies back home but

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,830
also that the foundation and web has a

00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:19,590
lot of information on local chapters and

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,870
how you can become one doesn't it

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:27,340

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,290

make sure if you see them as you're

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,620
leaving say thank you to them

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,530
individually because they pull off

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,660
effort in for several months now and it

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,180
builds up as it gets closer it's more

00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,010
and more work and also you know there's

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,370
been running around there's been lots of

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:44,050
messages so you know what's happening

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,670
sometimes we got it wrong and we had to

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,850
correct you and make sure you have the

00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:51,730
correct information and they've yeah

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,980
it's great I mean we really worry when

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,900
we run a conference I know how much the

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,560
volunteers are important to help you out

00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,330
I turned up on Friday morning to see the

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,990
venue for the first time they hit

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:07,570
assured me it was a good venue and I

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,430
came here I moved a table about two

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,520
meters and then they said no no someone

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,160
else will do this you go and see see

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,350
Millar and see some of Milan so I helped

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,640
them a bit longer but then I I could see

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,220
they're a great team and they've been

00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,710
wonderful and it's not just the

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,830
volunteers we've had here if you turn to

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,530
your booklet if you've still got it on

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:34,330
page 21 and then we ran out of space

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:36,070
some page 22 there's so a lot of people

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,820
a lot names that helped make this happen

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:42,160
and some of those people can't even make

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,960
it to the conference either even they

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,340
can at the beginning but still wanted to

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,740
help or or they would really like to be

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:54,040
here but things happened and they

00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:56,170
couldn't make it and I can't possibly

00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,640
mention them all because because it'll

00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,590
take a lot of time and I'll forget

00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,440
someone but but read through that and

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,000
you get an idea of the the work it takes

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,270
so we're very grateful to all those

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,270
people

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:18,330
[Applause]

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,820
so there's been a place to competition

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,820
this year and and that was one way that

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,770
some people could participate whether

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,800
they were here or not by submitting a

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:30,479
poster by showing us some nice maps I

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,300
hope you will went and saw them and I

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,229
thought hey used your blue dots too to

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,390
do the voting there I was amazed such

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,459
variants in what they were talking about

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:46,260
what they were showing and how they did

00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:48,779
that so we did this just for fun if you

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,470
had one of those posters afterwards you

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:56,010
can go and collect it and take it home

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:59,430
but I'm sure we did the the voting for a

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:03,620
big fun to see which one we liked in

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,930
third place with 88 votes how to map

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:11,600
[Music]

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:11,600
[Applause]

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:20,520
and just a bit just a few more fades

00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:26,350
that was very close um the wave 90 votes

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:31,700
was hiking trails map of Monty Pazhani

00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:36,480
[Applause]

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,220
and and that means that the winner got

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,110
even more stickers was even more

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,500
appreciated I really liked the colors

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:47,070
there and trying to work out which of

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:50,180
the maps I I recognized and that was a

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:59,810
hundred votes interchange choreography

00:09:50,180 --> 00:10:03,540
[Applause]

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:05,460
so um yes so they're exciting places if

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,860
you didn't get a chance to see them go

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,870
go down the corridor in a and take a

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,500
look before those people take their

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,660
posters home so there's a question how

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,080
did we get here after all how did we end

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,020

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,820
of the organization here of how many

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:15,570
volunteers it takes it's also really

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:20,760
good if you if you you know don't don't

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:22,470
wait for the process you don't wait to

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,460
be the International State of the map

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,590
you can also run

00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:30,460
of your regional conference or your

00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:34,180
national one even just making sure you

00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:36,370
you run some an event for your city can

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,070
really help you get the experience and

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,080
build up to that we're privileged that

00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,050
lots of state of the maps happen around

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:48,730
the world four continents four regions

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:54,040
or four countries and and we'd love to

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:55,870
hear about that so but but there was a a

00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,000
big process for next year I'm sure

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,850
you've all many of you have asked where

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,110
we're going so that's kind of the way

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:10,390
next from March we had a we had five

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:14,890
bids so we had Geneva Heidelberg

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:18,220
Cameroon Nigeria the Gambia all bid this

00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,770
meant that we had lots of discussion our

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,960
small kind of committee had to keep

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,120
discussing and well this is a good point

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,890
this is a good point that team maybe

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,050
need to be a bit stronger in this area

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:33,160
we went back and forth with a few

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,310
questions and and it we were we were

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,570
really privileged to have these vids

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,820
there's some phases they're just saying

00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:43,150
Greg get on with it

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:46,350
and they and say I mean that slide

00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:51,130
doesn't help what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:53,170
I'm I'm gonna play a video and as soon

00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,750
as the video plays I've asked some

00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,990
people to come up and announce it for me

00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,820
but as soon as you figure out where the

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,620
conference is gonna be next year why

00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,150
don't you clap along so when I play the

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,310
video if those people could come up

00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:14,880
please there's no sound but hopefully

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,880
those people that I said tied away

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,659
[Applause]

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:33,580
[Applause]

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:37,780
so this is this is the team from

00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:40,510
Heidelberg or and/or some of the team

00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,740
and I'm going to keep up playing and I

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,270
don't know if we'll be in that hotel

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,780
maybe you will I

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,880
I don't we go well and but I'm so it's

00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,960
going to be the Heidelberg in Germany is

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,360
that correct that's right and and it's

00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,710
as as Germany ever hosted the

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,410
international state of the map

00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,810
conference it has not it has not so it's

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,980
gonna be the first time there and

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:07,060
there's been one question I think

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:09,250
related to um to this year and I think

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,860
Melanie might answer this one cuz you

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:14,170
made some promises and are they gonna be

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:28,450
some more are there gonna be more or

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:33,270
less mosquitoes in hi and she even

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,270
promised me cold weather but maybe you

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:41,050
and I I don't know if we've composite in

00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,750
video but at one point in this video it

00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,360
talks about Heidelberg known for its

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:49,260
academic excellence and in OpenStreetMap

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:53,470
it's also known for its academic

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:55,120
convective 'ti and excellent so on so is

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,840
there any of you involved in the

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,570
university there all of you are

00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,520
brilliant so so we had for the first

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,860
time this year we had an academic track

00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,780
I think could that be something we might

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:11,830
see again definitely definitely

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:14,500
brilliant and so this is organized as

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:19,000
well there's a local chapter of opens

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,920
street map Germany they've I think

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,930
posted some national kind of

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,690
OpenStreetMap conferences along with

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:27,910
foss4g so it's you know they've better

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,080
make sense there there's it's not just

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:33,040
you guys have you've got some other

00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,530
people as well yeah that's basically

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,090
part of our local organizing team but I

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:40,060
think we have more in Heidelberg at the

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:42,800
moment sitting in our meeting room and

00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,170
we look forward to meeting them and it

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,480
was also you actually bid to be this

00:15:45,170 --> 00:16:14,120
year and it was really tough whether we

00:15:47,480 --> 00:16:16,250
went to Heidelberg or Milan and it's a

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,839
beautiful town so make sure to spend

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,510
some time there also to meet the team

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,160
because I think yeah okay all of them

00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,779
wanted to be here so we have more

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,310
colleagues in Heidelberg that wanted to

00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:27,050
get involved as well on that they're

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,060
looking forward to meeting you as well

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,920
Trillian thank you and we look forward

00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,510

September you don't want to miss it of

00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,480
course you know that if you're watching

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:54,380
on YouTube you've got chance to make the

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,170
effort to come there and the organizing

00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,750
team for state of the map are a bit

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,610
tired I know I am so we've got big work

00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,130
to do clean the videos online and the

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,110
slides and then we'll have a rest and

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,170
sleep more details will come

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:11,480
probably early I put the wrong year

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:15,439
there we're already in 2018 they'll come

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,390
in early 2019 but if you go to the state

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,670
of the map website you can subscribe to

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,280
the newsletter if you're not already you

00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:24,170
can get the updates as soon as tickets

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,750
are available and things like that so

00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:30,309
thank you to our goats from Heidelberg

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,309
thank you see you next year

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:45,440
William say hopefully everyone's written

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:48,110
that date in the diary and now we're

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,909
going to give a slight change because we

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,760
want to thank more people from the

00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:59,510
OpenStreetMap community and how we do

00:17:52,760 --> 00:18:01,809
that is is by trying of by running some

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:04,850
awards that thankfully Ilya helps with

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:08,149
and some people have been voting online

00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:19,309
on those so we'll change over the slides

00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:22,909
in a minute and are welcome Ilya slice I

00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:25,519
just want to say a couple words in the

00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:29,899
past four days I talked with awful lot

00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:35,000
of people and I learned and knew a lot

00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:37,070
on multiple various topics like vector

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,700
tiles machine learning diversity you

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:42,919
know a same public transport whatever

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:47,720
but the big picture I got out of it was

00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:51,620
not about topics but about opposition

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,380
map in general like imagine not right

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:57,980
now but in a week there are people in

00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:02,210
South America planning to go into slums

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:05,179
to map dangerous regions of City then

00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:08,809
people in Mexico calling the government

00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:11,570
to use opposite way more people in the

00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:14,200
United States looking at their child

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:18,769
into improv is disappointments and

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,880
people in United Kingdom our admins who

00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:24,080
look at your service

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:27,200
servers fight somewhere and other issue

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,269
and people in Germany preparing for

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,679
state of the map and inventing some

00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:38,360
we're taking schema and people in

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,700
Russian Siberia sailing on the cold

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,480
rivers and improving the map alongside

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:47,450
and people and

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,270
people in Nepal going to other city to

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:54,400
map it so it's rotating protected from

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:56,720
disaster and in Africa they gather

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,210
learning groups to know about more about

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,330
opposite map to teach and to prepare the

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,990
cities for anything that may come and in

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,260
Japan

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:10,180
how they try to apply European Center

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:13,190
taking schemas to their real cities and

00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,500
Microsoft Maps team calling their

00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,320
employees in Australia asking them to

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,450
validate something they imported so this

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:26,090
is opposite map is not just a project

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:28,970
it's like the space station so and I

00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:34,100
want to thank you not only for coming

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:38,000
here from a great number of different

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:40,250
countries but for devoting a substantial

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,450
part of your lives to improving the map

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:47,480
this is very valuable and it's rather

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:49,850
unusual that it still happens that the

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,220
project is still alive and that so many

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,780
people are willing to improve the open

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,290
map

00:20:53,780 --> 00:21:00,849
[Applause]

00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,849
[Music]

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:09,440
right and bindings of thinking we have

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:16,040
some kind of a tradition I may say so

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:17,990
obviously my rewards we well you the

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,860
community have submitted a lot of

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:26,000
nominees who you want to thank thankful

00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:29,210
their work and then the team of

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,540
volunteers selectors or at least and for

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:42,080
the past month a lot of people have been

00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:45,770
voting who who was who brought her a lot

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,880
to the project so almost half a thousand

00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:55,340
people have voted and they have chosen

00:21:48,880 --> 00:22:01,180
nine people or project projects among 33

00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:04,880
I think so let's see who was chosen

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:08,560
maybe somebody else wants to announce

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,560
nominees Marco

I think Richards gone already but I

00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,500
think but you know he's run way before

00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,840
will mock him because we have a good

00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:17,420
laugh with Richard but he does put in

00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:19,460
and he has put in a lot of work someone

00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,050
probably has Richards badge because

00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,560
there's a joke that it always gets

00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:29,020
passed around so nobody quite knows oh I

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,020
