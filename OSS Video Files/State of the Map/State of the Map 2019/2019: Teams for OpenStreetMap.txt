Title: 2019: Teams for OpenStreetMap
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2019
Description: 
	OSM Teams is a software framework for building team-based applications on top of OpenStreetMap. We will present how the software is built, why we think it's a good tool for communities, and how you can integrate your application with the framework.

OpenStreetMap is first and foremost a community platform. A lot of OSM mapping emerges from grassroots collaborations, from local neighborhood communities to large-scale mapping initiatives. These collectives need tools to communicate, collaborate and sustain their combined motivation around mapping, and to that end we present OSM Teams.

OSM Teams is a software framework for building team-based applications on top of OpenStreetMap. Development Seed built Teams internally to coordinate mapping projects, and to share tasks and statistics across mapping applications built on top of OSM. By building an authentication and authorization framework on top of the OSM login, we enable a second identity layer for teams that can be shared throughout apps. If adopted by the wider community, OSM Teams would bring structure to organizational editing. Teams would also support individual mappers by empowering them to discover new communities and causes, and to better understand who else is editing the map.

With this presentation, I would like to start a technical and community focused conversation about running organizations, teams, and communities using this framework. Specifically the questions I would like to bring to the community are: how does this fit with existing community patterns? How do we reduce complexity for new mappers? What new application possibilities does this open up?

a little bit about me

00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,780
few years ago I used to run a

00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,869
hackerspace in Beirut I got into mapping

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,000
I work now for it bellman seed you can

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:25,890
see it on my t-shirt we build a lot of

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,529
cool tools for OpenStreetMap now I built

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,119
this over the past few months I wanted

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,020
to share with the community started this

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:38,100
question so here's what we're gonna talk

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,769
about basically why we need a 18

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,690
software this is just one solution but

00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:45,899
why we need a team software what we've

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,640
built some technical notes so who here

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,320
is a developer or considers themself a

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,719
developer okay two-thirds but for the

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,079
other one-third if I'm talking too fast

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,440
you can just stop me or like shout at me

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,120
like no it doesn't make sense and then

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,930
we're gonna talk about roadmap and ideas

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,070
and then open it up for a discussion so

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,070
boom statement or some is the

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,920
decentralized social network everyone

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,150
here is part of the small community or a

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,580
large community everyone kind of you

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,390
know no one Maps alone or if you do

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,659
maybe find a friend but if you are

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,070
mapping you are part of this part of

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,540
this great social network and you know

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,640
here we're in this conference we're all

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,090
talking to each other chair sharing

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,900
ideas and another thing that's in these

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,490
conferences is you see a lot of apps and

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,340
osm is not just this community of

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,909
mappers it's a bunch of disconnected

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,939
apps you've got apps like and great apps

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,759
they power you up give you these

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,399
capabilities they you know supercharge

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,780
your mapping right tasking manager or

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,229
some sha

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,619
all the great editors but they don't

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:10,290
talk to each other and so the OSM user

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:12,810
experience going into one app editing or

00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:17,230
getting tasks or whatever and then going

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:21,770
to another app that is

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:25,490
that feels disconnected and we know that

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:30,860
apps are building tools for coordinated

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:32,540
mapping so we've got some chart here you

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:37,550
know they have a concept of teams they

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:40,700
have a concept of lists and then in the

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:44,690
tasking manager there's you know this

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:49,310
pull request and issue that says hey we

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:53,090
also need teams but osm Chow and task

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:55,040
manager sure they meet up here and they

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,200
can do that and the developers in the

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,660
community and they say maybe we can talk

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,239
to each other but what about other

00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:06,770
developers that want to build teams or

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:10,360
want to build this feature at least so

00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:14,959
we were thinking okay we need an API and

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:19,280
this API needs to allow all the apps to

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,530
talk to each other and it allows you to

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,250
have a team that is for example in the

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:27,380
tasking manager and then be portable to

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,090
awesome job and then this API has to be

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,190
flexible as well you know the schema

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,760
doesn't have to be really hard and then

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:37,010
it's very important that it uses osm IDs

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,130
osm ideas give us the security that you

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,540
are who you say you are and that you're

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:46,250
part of the community and Rowland was

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:48,830
talking about this right that it ties

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,190
you to a known quantity in the

00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:55,040
OpenStreetMap ecosystem and also what

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,870
you don't want to anger anyone so it

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,470
should be part of you know this

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:06,230
community discussion here so that's

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:09,049
teams teams is an app platform and it's

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:13,400
an API and you say app platform maybe

00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:16,200
that's really like large and you know it

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,740
could mean whole

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,620
Oh of things right but basically it's

00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:26,220
we're allowing developers to build an

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:30,920
app on top of teams so we're allowing

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:33,510
developers to integrate with our API

00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:38,070
does anyone everyone here knows what an

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:42,030
API is or doesn't know okay so basically

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:46,440
an interface so that if I have an

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:48,870
application I want a common interface to

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,790
communicate with another app and that's

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,200
what we're trying to create because in

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,790
the end of the day we want to create a

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,340
unified user experience we want to be

00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,960
able to go on the tasking manager create

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,120
a team and then find that team somewhere

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,500
else where someone goes and builds a

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,600
chat app they should have teams as well

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,860
so this is how it looks like it's very

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:15,840
retro I love it so that's the front page

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:17,670
it's at mapping dot team if you click on

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,220
explore teams you can see a list of

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,980
teams you can see a map some teams have

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,580
put a location so that you can filter

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:31,020
teams using map you know the mapa bounds

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:33,090
and B boxes because sure it's called

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,190
teams and you might think that it's for

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:40,860
large mapping teams but we also want to

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:43,440
cater to local communities this is what

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,880
a team looks like a team profile page

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,070
and has a bio a hashtag but you know

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,820
this is more free text to kind of find

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,860
your team's data somewhere else and the

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:59,700
location like I was saying and then

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:02,850
members of that team if you're a

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,850
moderator of the team you can sign in

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:11,310
and edit this information add and remove

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:15,830
numbers so here's a scary part technical

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:19,250
notes and again if I'm talking too fast

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,250
please let me know

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:29,270
so this is kind of what we want teams to

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:33,540
be right so the circle thingy is a

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:37,070
database and then the square next to it

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:41,760
oh SMT can everyone see the graph yeah

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:44,040
that thing is the API right this is

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,880
where it stores all the team's data and

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:51,060
then gives it to people and then we have

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,880
a something in the middle called an

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:58,290
OAuth server who here knows what a auth

00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:02,490
means at least yeah you've seen it

00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:05,370
before if you are let's say on Instagram

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,590
and then you want to import your

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,560
Facebook contacts you have to click

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:14,010
connect my Facebook account or something

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,150
and then it would go to Facebook and

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:21,780
says do you want to allow Instagram

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:24,060
access to your Facebook account and it

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,900
does this for every user why does it do

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,580
it because we want because Instagram and

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,340
Facebook want to create a secure

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:36,030
connection you have private contacts and

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,440
so maybe you have private teams and you

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,790
don't want to reveal who those team

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:47,730
people team members are maybe you're a

00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:50,760
secret railway mapper team and you don't

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:54,330
want to say who the elite crew is so

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:57,930
this is this allows us to create private

00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:00,150
team this consent mechanism and so other

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:04,440
apps can connect through this consent

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:10,440
mechanism and say it takes you to SM

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:14,160
teams and it says do you want to allow X

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:17,070
app access to your teams and then it

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,400
brings you back and then there you have

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:22,350
your private teams or public teams or

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,020
whatever the API provides you but you

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:27,889
have a secret key

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,710
to allow access to your user account

00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:34,740
does that make sense for everyone

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,680
Thanks now everything I said is written

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:46,430
by a bunch of nerds and these I contract

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:50,160
these texts call or RF RFC's right and

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:52,680
they're they're really really hard to

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,600
parse or you have to take a long time to

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,930
parse them I know because it took me two

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,940
months to write read all of them but I

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:03,149
didn't want to implement all of this

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,310
because it's error-prone and it's a lot

00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:08,880
of security stuff and we shouldn't be

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:11,550
responsible for the security stuff so we

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,290
use another library that can abstract

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,560
this and they have their own security

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:22,770
audits sort of a library called Hydra

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,600
and it just you see it places itself in

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,660
the middle and it says if you're a user

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,000
you talk to Hydra and then it talks to

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,550
our server and then the login provider

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,220
that's awesome because you log into osm

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:38,550
and you log into our send teams using

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,040
osm so it knows that you're you and then

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,550
Hydra can give you these secret keys and

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,070
I don't have to implement all that

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,450
really complicated stuff and then this

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,630
is how it looks like this is the app

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:54,510
structure you have your osm ID and

00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:59,910
that's coming from OSM then you have the

00:09:54,510 --> 00:10:04,370
API and that ID that is secure and then

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:08,550
you can build your apps on top of teams

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:12,180
now I did this I made this diagram

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:14,760
because I wanted to say that here we

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,560
built another login on top of the OS MIT

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,620
we built another authentication layer

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:24,959
and what that allows us to do is add

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:28,709
more metadata to this new login so it

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,230
can be really anything you want like we

00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:33,930
built osm teams because we wanted to

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,880
make sure that it's osm IDs and those

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,760
were some IDs are tied to your user data

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:46,210
then that login can have your team's

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:49,240
data and so the flow of oh sorry before

00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,980
I talk about the flow if you're a

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,780
developer if you want to integrate with

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:58,630
our platform we have an API guide we

00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:01,120
have API Doc's we have example

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:06,880
applications of how to you know

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:09,640
integrate with teams and you can always

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,740
of course ask me like oh I don't know

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:17,650
how this works and then I'll help you

00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:22,270
out of course but once you integrate you

00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:25,570
would want to create a client first so

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:27,790
for example a SATA map it looks very

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,800
similar to a SMF if you've already

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,650
implemented osm authority over the

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,440
application and then Hydra gives you

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:38,620
these client IDs and these client

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,510
secrets and then you use that so you can

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,660
go to us and teams you sign in you get a

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:49,240
client ID client secret and then my cool

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:53,440
app or my secret railway chat app can

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:56,140
then talk to teams you get this client

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,210
secret and then you build your app you

00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,370
implement the OAuth 2 protocol on your

00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,050
client side and then you can integrate

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,450
with you and I know that's boring I'll

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:08,800
skip over to the cool part but this is

00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:11,230
how it looks so if this is a small

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,210
example app I built on glitch which is

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:17,470
if you go to glitch comm you can build

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:20,770
really cool apps really fast and I

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:25,840
created a connect mapping team button so

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:27,760
if you click on this it works ok it

00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,120
takes you to SM teens it tells you login

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:37,630
with osm you login with OSM it asks for

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:40,060
my fingerprints login and then once you

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,770
grant access from the first so SM ID it

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,830
tells you glitch app wants access to

00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,800
your team's you allow access and there I

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,079
have my private team map key bear

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:55,739
which is not my team it's the one McHale

00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:57,959
made but you can see that that flow was

00:12:55,739 --> 00:13:00,059
pretty simple that is the flow that you

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:03,689
would want to use to integrate in your

00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:06,149
app you press connect team takes you to

00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:14,069
us and teams grants access takes you

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:19,709
back with your private teams no okay

00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:24,350
and then this is the API so you can get

00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:27,749
teams you can add people to your team

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,160
you can do a search by location and

00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:31,949
that's what we've implemented right now

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:37,259
but we want to of course expand this API

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:39,269
with community input so roadmap the

00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:42,389
first thing we want to make sure works

00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:46,970
is private and public team because I

00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:52,379
know that there are that is our most

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:56,720
requested feature private teams we want

00:13:52,379 --> 00:14:00,360
to make sure there's a privacy policy

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,269
because that was actually the first

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,149
issue that someone opened was like

00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:09,209
where's the privacy policy so we have to

00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:11,189
address address that and we want to

00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:13,980
figure out a way to work with the

00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:16,259
community you know this is on a

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:20,279
development seed server we would really

00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:24,029
rather be at a neutral party on an osm

00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:28,129
server or some us or some neutral engine

00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:30,360
- you will have to figure that out and

00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:33,569
some ideas I've been talking to people

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,549
around in the conference and there was

00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:38,519
some pushback but some people want to

00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:41,220
build on top of this already so someone

00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,799
wants to build a chat app and someone

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,999
wants to build event planning and I'm

00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,999
sure that there are people here that

00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:51,660
have uses for teens right they want to

00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:55,319
integrate with this and get their team

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,839
and we are not here to give you all the

00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:59,150
ideas we're creating the platform so

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,130
that people can

00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,810
you know think about all the their use

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,380
cases for teams and then integrate with

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,910
so if you had a way to use this I want

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,900
to hear about it or maybe if you're a

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:13,760
developer build something some good

00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:18,140
points some bad points I touched really

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:21,380
quickly on this so some will ask why is

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:25,880
this not in the core API I think it

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:27,830
should be in the core API but it's tough

00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,220
to get something into the core API

00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,980
without people testing it out first and

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:37,460
so we're opening it up for public better

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:40,820
everyone here can use it at mapping the

00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,010
dart team that's the URL show us your

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,630
use cases show us that this is something

00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:48,110
that you want to integrate with and then

00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,480
we can standardize the API and we want

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,970
to do this now because we've seen apps

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,089
like tasking manager and osm char

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:59,630
already building teams and we want we

00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:02,150
don't want to be stuck in a developer

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,910
battle you know two years down the line

00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:09,140
everyone's siloed back again into this

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:12,050
disconnected ecosystem so we're trying

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,209
to force a conversation here and we're

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,730
here to talk about it

00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:19,760
and I hope that developers come up to me

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,830
and say or open a pull request or open

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,870
an issue and say hey let's integrate

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:27,709
let's figure out how to standardize the

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:32,660
API so that's teams basically it's a

00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:33,950
social glue for the OSM apps it's you

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:39,470
know we talked about how it was built

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:42,640
and what we want to do with it and I'm

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:45,640
gonna open the floor for discussion now

00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,640
so

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,960
hello hey so if you ever please raise

00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,910
your hand

00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,650
and if on you on this side of the room I

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,310
will want to make to you on this side of

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:05,579
the room who shall we run a mic to you

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:11,339
and you want to go first we have about

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:14,220
ten minutes yes one basic questions you

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:17,160
didn't make clear what is an app is an

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:20,339
app only as there are people who think

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:24,750
app is exclusively for an Android

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:26,880
smartphone or for smartphones or will it

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:32,370
be for Linux and Windows as well

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:34,710
yeah so when I meant I meant any piece

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:38,040
of code that wants to interact with

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,690
jeans be you know of course any

00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,670
operating system app it could be any

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,430
smartphone app it could be web

00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:47,840
applications which are just websites

00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:56,100
that have a bit more code to do this

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:58,290
this type of interaction so you built

00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,280
some infrastructure and you showed us in

00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,860
the picture how it looks with the

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,860
database where does this database sit

00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,810
and what's like what's the Asscher

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,250
instead you're not gonna switch off the

00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,930
database in three months time and say

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,090
other experiment didn't work and then

00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,940
all the teams are gone yeah very good

00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,640
question right now

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:21,060
teams and sidon better I wouldn't build

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:26,910
anything with production data on it

00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:27,510
and we are trying to say this is how it

00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,100
works

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,230
this is how you would potentially

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,290
integrate I do want to get it to

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,000
production and I want to be able to have

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,280
a conversation of where should this

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,050
production database be and hopefully

00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,410
with the community we can come to an

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,410
answer

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:55,860
could you could you say in which case do

00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,920
the user need to authenticate wise or

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:04,380
mapping teams and in which case it's

00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:08,309
just the same login like way I built an

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:10,380
app in which case the user would need to

00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:16,620
authenticate also in the mapping team's

00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:20,220
API in which case would the users would

00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:28,020
need to to make note education to

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:32,760
connect okay so the API if you want to

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:36,830
have any sort of permissions like create

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,720
an updated team or delete a team yeah

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:42,900
you would need to authenticate with the

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,740
API if you are implementing private

00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:49,799
teams and you want to have your private

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:54,540
team synced with the API you also need

00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:56,100
to request with a key so if you are just

00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,100
working with public teams and you're

00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:02,000
just showing them public teams in our

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:05,040
ayah in our schema are teens that

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,549
divulge their team members and private

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,669
or not right so if you're just working

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:12,510
with public teams then you're not you

00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:16,730
don't need a key

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,730
and you can search without a key

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,000
any other questions

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:36,090
so if this goes too far you'll let me

00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:38,470
know but what you just said

00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:41,530
you know what if there's a team

00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:45,730
discussing political change in China and

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:47,799
you know somebody gets added to a team

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,200
without their knowledge and then a

00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:53,080
police come and say you are on this team

00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,790
you know that kind of stuff that's a

00:20:53,080 --> 00:21:01,419
good question and we've been thinking

00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:03,429
about that you know we want to be able

00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:05,470
to implement notification so there are

00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:08,380
many solutions to this problem right you

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:10,750
can and and different social networks

00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,460
have different ways of handling the

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,010
problem like on whatsapp you can leave

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:18,520
at any time someone needs to know your

00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:21,549
your telephone number and a Facebook

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:25,059
group you have to confirm before being

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:28,480
added to a group so you can do a confirm

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:30,280
model you can do a model where the

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,600
person needs to know something about you

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:36,940
like the telephone number or the user ID

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,890
or you can do something where all teams

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,720
are closed and juste have to send an

00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:44,679
invitation and that that person has to

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,820
accept the invitation but it's it's

00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,640
definitely something that we've been

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:51,130
thinking about another way to do this is

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,750
for example we create a user setting

00:21:51,130 --> 00:22:00,220
like I don't want to be added to groups

00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:02,620
so this would be one way to handle I
