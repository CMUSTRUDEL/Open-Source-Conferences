Title: 2019: Analyzing the spatio-temporal patterns and impacts of large-scale data production events in Op
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2019
Description: 
	In this talk, large scale data production events in OSM are identified, characterized, and their spatio-temporal patterns and impacts are analyzed. The results show that remote mapping events produce more data today than bulk imports, yet that the former type has a more lasting impact on representation, hence pointing towards possible steps for maximizing the positive influences of events of different types.

Volunteered geographical information often visions data as a product of individual actions. In OpenStreetMap (OSM) however, contributions are frequently made as part of large-scale data production events. These events, which can take multiple forms (e.g. organized activities of local chapters, mobilization of global communities, and imports of externally collected datasets), do contribute much to the OSM project. Nevertheless, they also hold the potential to significantly affect local representations by changing the development course of data and community, thus biasing representation. Hence, it is important to identify and understand such events, as well as their impacts upon the data.
This talk sets out to contribute to the study of these issues by identifying large-scale data production events in OSM, classifying them, and analyzing their spatio-temporal patterns and impacts. For this, we use the OSM History Database (OSHDB) tool to extract the cumulative number of contribution operations (i.e. the operations made as part of each contribution) by month for different areas. Assuming that in the absence of events the cumulative distribution of monthly operations over time would follow an S-shaped form (since data grows constantly, and even more so when the community grows, until it reaches some form of saturation), we fit a logistic curve to each of these time series. Events are identified as months where observed values are significantly higher than the ones predicted by the fitted curve. Thus, events are defined not only in terms of their absolute size but also according to their relative weight in the development of the data. In the subsequent step, events are clustered into types according to different measures, e.g. the maximal number of contributions made by one user and the share of creations, deletions, tag changes, and geometry changes in all contributions, representing their nature in terms of centralization and contribution themes.
The results show that a significant share of all OSM contributions is made as part of an event, with some data regions almost entirely dominated by these. Furthermore, it does not seem that the number of event contributions is decreasing over time. Looking deeper into the nature of events, we identify two different event types based on the contribution of individuals – local events and remote mapping events – and several bulk import event types, diverging mostly in the share of creations in the events’ contributions. Computing the number of events over time shows that while data creation imports were the most frequent type of events early on, over the last years remote mapping events are contributing the most data. Locally based events also show a significant increase in data production. However, these types of events are not distributed evenly across the globe, with import events frequent mostly in countries with developed economies and remote mapping events being more common in the least developed regions of the world. Interestingly, the negative (and expected) correlation between the time of the event and its impact on the data exists only for import events and not for remote mapping events. Hence, mapping and analyzing large-scale events allows relating the nature representation to socio-economic effects.
This talk further breaks down the spatio-temporal patterns of events, investigating whether the temporal patterns for different regions follow the global ones or are there clusters of temporal change as well. Furthermore, we study the nature of events’ impacts, presenting how the values of measures such as the stability of events’ contributions and change in the number of active mappers vary by event type and area. These results, beyond promoting a deeper understanding of events and representation in OSM, allow assessing the implications for the project of current and expected trends in OSM data production, hence facilitating the formulation of global and local steps aimed at maximizing events’ positive impacts and controlling their adverse influences.

presentation is about analyzing this

00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,200
space

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,369
of large-scale data productions event

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,740
production events in OSF and is by yeah

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:28,500
and others so please yeah you have 20

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:30,289
minutes okay thank you hi I'm a lecturer

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,239
at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem

00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:35,640
but until recently I was a member of the

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,199
GI science research group here thanks to

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,530
the funding of the Alexander von

00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:42,720
Humboldt Foundation so this work started

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,140
here in cooperation with people from

00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,210
here and continues on so and basically

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,190
what we're trying to do is to try to

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,129
identify large-scale events in in

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,400
OpenStreetMap and understand how they

00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:02,460
impact the data and the community and

00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:04,530
just to contextualize everything the the

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,830
fort comes from the evolving idea of

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,560
notion of vgi which started from the

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,510
very what now is cliche everyone with a

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,030
computer with an internet connection can

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,580
map it's a bottom-up approach and which

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,340
evolved academically into understanding

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,829
of when you research who vgi when you

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,009
research stuff like our sam you cannot

00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:28,950
separate the process from the data and

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,280
you need to study those together and

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,500
that led on to a contextual

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,850
understanding of the data you always

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,310
need to understand the context in which

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,609
data is presented and is produced when

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,920
you study it and thanks God

00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:47,159
OpenStreetMap is rich with contextual

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,499
effects starting with in which platform

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,240
if you map you map which kind of

00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:54,719
interactions do you have with other

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:58,140
matters this conference mailing list and

00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:01,829
so on organizations we heard about a bit

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,469
about that and also data events which is

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,999
the focus of this talk and when when I

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,830
say data events you probably think of

00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:12,480
that but like math attends social

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,240
gatherings but that's only one of the

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,400
perspective for defining events in

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,830
OpenStreetMap the let's call it the

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,799
social one demand it's more about how

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,349
people gather and and produce data

00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:27,880
together but I'm more interested in this

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,200
talk and data perspective

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,420
like looking at events that

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,320
significantly changed the data that make

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:39,280
a real effect and specifically I'm

00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,070
looking at large-scale events why

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,290
because they are first of all all the

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:49,150
click hold the capacity to greatly

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:53,030
affect the data and the community and

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:56,960
when I say large scale data events I

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:59,300
refer to high volume of contributions

00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,910
over a short time now high and short are

00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,920
highlighted here because what is high

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,070
what is short that's something that it's

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,690
not easy to determine and you can look

00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:12,650
at this graph here that shows the number

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,750
of identities over time in the Gaza

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,770
Strip and in Tel Aviv so you see in Gaza

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:22,070
you have a large increase in 2014 but

00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:25,180
there's also a small one in 2009 and the

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:29,420
question is is that a large-scale event

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,680
how big any sizable contribution of

00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,400
volume contribution needs to be in order

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,140
to be an event to significantly affect

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,750
the data and that's something I will

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:43,100
touch on later so in this corn study

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:46,220
first of all we try to under that make a

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,430
significant change we analyze their

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:52,670
spatial temporal patterns and see how

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:56,300
the dynamics of events evolve and we try

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:59,480
to study the impacts of those events so

00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:04,610
as I said there's a need to define what

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:08,870
is large-scale event one option could be

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,910
defining an arbitrary value beyond which

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,210
the number of contribution is considered

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:16,690
large but what we did here is trying to

00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:20,170
adopt another approach which considered

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:23,900
the stage in the production of the data

00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:27,020
and how the data should evolve without

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,980
an event and what actually happens so we

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,140
assumed there's a normative or event

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:36,260
absent kind of model in which there are

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:39,830
three basic stages that based on a paper

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,200
by Gaussian and colleagues so first of

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,560
all there should be

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,030
a stage where there's aren't that many

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,840
contribution there aren't that many

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:52,420
active mappers then the activity picks

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,400
up there are lots of contribution and

00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,590
then this should be some kind of

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,560
saturation of the data and the rate of

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:05,170
contribution should a kind of more

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,760
saturate and that should create like if

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,910
you look at it individually over time

00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,070
this bell-shaped result in the number of

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,200
contribution and in the Colombian

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,620
cumulative manner it should be like this

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:23,440
s-shaped approach and we define events

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:26,200
as as contributions that are so large

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,550
that are not predicted by such a model

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,140
so you can see here that and this is

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,480
hypothetical right that's just an

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:39,010
example you can see that an event really

00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,790
changes the trajectory of the data and

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:47,880
brings saturation earlier so how did we

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:52,030
do that first of all we counted the

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,850
contribution actions pair time unit in

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,830
each area we looked at and contribution

00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,450
actions are not just the contributions

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:04,510
but raking down each contribution to the

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:06,490
specific actions within it to as a means

00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:10,450
to differentiate between just deleting

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,640
something and editing so creation was

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,790
counted as the total number of nodes

00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:19,540
added plus the number of tags that edits

00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:22,410
was counting both what was removed and

00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,540
what was added and deletions was just

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:29,680
one action ensuing that you just click

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:33,880
on and and delete and we create greater

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,520
the cumulative time series for such data

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:44,530
and fitted logistic curve to that data

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:47,080
because it's s-shaped and then we

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,330
computed the legged residuals of that

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,930
model wide-legged residual so you can

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,930
see in orange

00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:57,349
the errors the differences as they are

00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,569
when that they are not legged when when

00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:01,369
I considered II did the absolutely and

00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:07,279
you can see there's a temporal trend the

00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:11,599
events keeps on continuing much time

00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:14,629
after the event but when we compute the

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,179
leg residuals meaning the residual at

00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:20,929
time T minus the residual at time t

00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:24,939
minus 1 then this trend disappears and

00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:27,619
we can identify the event so this is

00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:32,149
perceptually the procedure and how we

00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:35,419
applied it so basically this is based on

00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:37,429
the OpenStreetMap historical database

00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,689
tool that was developed here at

00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:42,139
Heidelberg

00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:44,929
it started with defining a spatial

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:49,599
division of space of the world in a

00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:54,169
quadtree approach starting with four

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:57,349
four tiles and splitting them as long as

00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:00,679
there's at least one tile with at least

00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:04,099
20,000 entities in it so that resulted

00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:05,929
in a special division where cells are

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:08,239
not of the same size and not necessarily

00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:10,009
have the same number of entities but at

00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:13,489
least a number of entities that is worth

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:15,139
analyzing the temporal resolution for

00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:17,599
the time series was one month because

00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:20,899
what taking one day would be would make

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:25,069
the data too noisy and the time period

00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:29,599
was from November 2007 up to March 2019

00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:35,719
because before data became more reliable

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:38,779
after the switch the 0.5 API so I'll

00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,849
just say one thing because the spatial

00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:43,219
division may create many cells within

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:46,819
the same region that's gonna flanked the

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,470
number of events I'm gonna identify so

00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:51,379
don't be alarmed when you see large

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,439
numbers just one event in the u.s.

00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:55,759
itself could account for thousands of

00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:58,610
individual events in my data set in

00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:02,020
these data set apart from the number of

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,420
actions per month we also

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,060
got some other info from that number of

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:10,240
active users number of contributions by

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,730
type the maximum number of actions by

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:18,459
one user and the actions per edited

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:22,630
entity and so out of ten thousand more

00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:24,550
than ten thousand cells 700 cells showed

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,279
converges error so they are not part of

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,350
the analysis we considered only events

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,560
with number of actions that was greater

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,570
than seven thousand and that led to 48

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,760
thousand events different events again

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,310
also you need to think that events may

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,600
last over more than one month so they

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:47,170
are also separated temporarily well it's

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,200
kind of hard to talk about the goodness

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:53,589
of fit of the model when we constructed

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,990
it to be wrong to begin with but our M

00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,779
normalized RMC values normalized by the

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:01,420
median value of the of the observed data

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:04,570
they are still quite good and you can

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,600
see that while the median median number

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:11,410
of events is 5 per cell but if you start

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,490
unifying them according to unifying them

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:20,740
temporarily then the number drops to 4

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:23,380
and to further to be able to have more

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,570
deep discussion about the results we try

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:32,190
to classify the events using a k-means

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:32,190
procedures determining K to be equal 6

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:43,510
after exploring the data and calculating

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:48,310
some some measures like the Davis

00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:51,790
building one and we clusters based on 5

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:55,480
variables when mainly forward the share

00:10:51,790 --> 00:11:00,820
of each type of contribution creation

00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:04,420
deletion tag edit and and geometry edit

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:07,990
and the share of all contribution during

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:10,540
that periods of the maximal by one user

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:13,839
so how much of the data was contribute

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,440
by just one user and you can see the

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,620
results here

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,230
so that's the median value across

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,210
multiple variables for the different

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:27,170
clusters that we created and one we can

00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:29,870
see first of all is that there are two

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:33,320
groups here in the maximum contribution

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:35,870
by one user four groups are dominated by

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:39,350
almost one user contributing most of the

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:42,680
data so those are imports and two are

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:44,900
more distributed when we compare those

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:50,140
that do that are more distributed we can

00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:55,580
see that the green one is not as much

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:57,740
focused on creations as the purple one

00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,380
and if we look at the number of users

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,140
which wasn't using the clustering but we

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,620
compare it here we can see that there

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:09,050
are much more users in this kind of

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,420
event than this kind of event so we

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,450
turned them the green one is local event

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:19,820
and the purple one our remote mapping

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:22,900
events looking at the other the remote

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:27,190
the imports so we can see this one is

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:32,210
almost dedicated entirely to creations

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:36,580
and in terms of how much time on demand

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:39,260
in value since November 2007 had passed

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:42,350
we can see that it's quite early

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,240
relative to most other types of event so

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,330
we called it early import it's just a

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:54,650
bulk import of data we can compare it to

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:57,740
the black one which is which is a less

00:12:54,650 --> 00:13:01,480
centered or creations and a bit later in

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:07,130
which I called recalled late import and

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:10,070
finally the not finally yet the the the

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,380
yellow one which is almost which is has

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,660
the highest rate of geometry edit so

00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,790
basically we're talking of free type of

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,540
imports each of them a bit later than

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:23,180
the other on average so that you can say

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,640
that each kind of import is more mature

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,480
so you have early import creating the

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,970
data late import more

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,550
editing of the data and geometry update

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:36,070
which is really editing data and finally

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:39,160
we have this this strange result of one

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:42,010
one cluster that is focused on mostly on

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:47,620
tag edits and we look at it a bit later

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:51,310
on but it's it's it's existing so how

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:54,130
how impactful are those events in terms

00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:57,399
of share of out of all contributions in

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,199
the history of Open Street Map and the

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:04,000
question is that the answer is quite a

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:07,839
lot so you can see about 45% out of out

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
of all creations and when we break it

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,380
down we can see that early imports are

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,019
are are responsible for much of the

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,930
activity in OpenStreetMap now this is a

00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:22,510
bit overestimated because we're using

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:25,720
the one month resolution but even if you

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:30,190
are would remove the 10% of the smallest

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:34,980
events those numbers didn't fall by much

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,980
so I would still consider that

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,819
meaningfully up looking at it

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:45,610
temporarily so what we can see in terms

00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:49,029
of number of events we can see that well

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:54,550
early imports were more frequent earlier

00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:57,550
naturally and but over time both local

00:14:54,550 --> 00:15:00,610
events and remote remote events become

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:02,490
more and more frequent and when we look

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,949
at the average number of contributions

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:08,760
in very event we can see that that also

00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:11,829
Rises for local events and for remote

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:16,120
events although over the last few months

00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:19,449
that's not as much evident so we can see

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,360
a shift here from in terms of the

00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:24,639
maturity of the events related to the

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,290
maturity of the data and in terms of the

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,300
practices which events are happening

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:31,089
instead of imports more and more

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,399
community-based events in that so well

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:37,899
imports are in some sense also community

00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:40,630
based spatial distribution so you can

00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:42,370
see there are some clusters where much

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,089
of the data was created during the

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:52,449
well Canada parts of the u.s. large

00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:58,410
sections of sub-saharan Africa and parts

00:15:52,449 --> 00:16:02,499
of Thailand and Indonesia interestingly

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:04,720
it's not in fact in Europe it's not it

00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:08,079
changes so you can see the Netherlands

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,620
here really dependent on imports part of

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,870
our friends and let's compare that with

00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,309
the most frequent type of event per cell

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:22,509
and we can see that the tag imports here

00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:25,300
are mainly centered in in in in in in

00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:27,699
the US and if you notice before they

00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,129
happen mostly during 2009 so that that

00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:32,199
was one event during 2009 and guess it I

00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:33,670
didn't manage to really pinpoint that

00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:37,180
but I guess it's some kind of Tiger

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:39,999
important related issue but what you can

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:44,980
see that sub-saharan Africa is dominated

00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:51,790
by remote mapping events and also sorry

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:54,610
and also parts of Thailand Indonesia so

00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:57,850
we can see some kind of socio-cultural

00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,339
relations but which events take place

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,319
where and how much effect they have on

00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:05,110
the data because if you remember those

00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:08,140
areas that I've just pointed to I also

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:13,480
want that have high impact of events on

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:17,699
the data so but what are the impacts

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:22,240
impacts on activity so we isolated those

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:23,890
events which had no event peer to the

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,260
six month period to them or six months

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:29,470
later and computed the difference the

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:32,409
change in different measures so that's

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:35,020
percent of increase or decrease and what

00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:36,909
we can see and comparing two months that

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,460
didn't have event before and after and

00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:42,820
during and what we can see that remote

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:46,270
mapping events have a substantial effect

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:49,750
on activity later on even if we compare

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:52,679
it to the control group early imports

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,720
also have some some some effect but

00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,210
geometry and

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,840
important late import are actually

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,010
reducing activity to some extent and

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,600
well tag import I don't want to talk

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:09,370
about it because it really is a kind of

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:12,460
free course local events also don't

00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:14,410
affect that much or because well it

00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,600
doesn't necessarily mean that that they

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:19,450
don't have effect it means that the same

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,520
community is still active when comparing

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:25,900
at twelve months instead of six months

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,690
that still remains about the same and I

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:34,000
think remote events even become a bit

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:38,440
more dominant but also early imports and

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,300
and and tag imports create some effect

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,790
and it mainly centered on editing so

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,460
kind of correcting the data so we see

00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:51,550
increased activity of cracking data but

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:56,520
also in the number of users at least for

00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:56,520
tag imports so that's also interesting

00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:03,640
well that's the probability of event

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:06,730
start the relations between events so if

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,930
a first event was of that type was what

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,740
is the probability of that being

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:13,720
followed by this kind of event and what

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:18,550
I'll say about that because my time is

00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:20,830
running out is that geometry that

00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:26,200
imports tend to be followed by imports

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:27,820
and but when we look at the local the

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,970
probability of having a local event

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:34,720
that's also related to imports so

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:37,930
imports can create more activity that

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,360
related to editing and may also create

00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,910
local events so I'll quickly sum up

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,740
because I'm over over my time so we can

00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,290
see that large events large-scale events

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,300
have effect on the data there are

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:52,540
contextual products that relate to

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,840
social geographical context and to the

00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:58,360
maturity of data they every fall with

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:03,790
remote events they may increase the

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:06,610
activity of of matters but they may have

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,970
adverse effect but sometimes wrongs can

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,009
make a right so

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:14,090
increased activity of editing after an

00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:16,190
import so the main takeaway is that when

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,409
we're thinking about organizing event or

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,480
events or having a large-scale

00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:22,039
contribution we need to think about the

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,840
context and there would be first

00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,529
analysis but I'll stop here because I'm

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,529
way over time

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:38,340
thanks for the excellent presentation we

00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,690
have about four minutes question time so

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,880
if you have any question please raise

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:50,880
your hand we have two mice one there one

00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:56,220
here and now come to you do you have any

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:58,800
good understanding of why these remote

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:04,530
events cause so much activity afterwards

00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:10,830
well first of all something I had just

00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:12,180
quickly skip but first of all I'm not

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:15,630
sure that's played but I've said it

00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,460
anyway for there's there's hot and an

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,700
organization like that which may have

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:24,270
also a local component so that's part of

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,820
that and we can see that remote about

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,550
third of more than third of remote

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,870
events are followed by local events so

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:37,110
that could be dead okay

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:41,520
although on the other side it's only 33%

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:43,230
so but surely and I was thinking that

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,690
also that morning that we need to break

00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:51,750
down those remote events and see whether

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:56,330
this activity is related to those 36% or

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,330
not but the answer may lie they there

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:04,250
any further questions over there okay

00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,580
well first thank you for a very

00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,290
impressive talk I was just wondering

00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,810
referring to what Jennings talked about

00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:18,500
before the effect of cooperative edits

00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:20,750
if they should show up somebody was just

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,660
thinking about mapping activities saying

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:27,410
in Thailand if they I guess they have

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,960
been somehow well summarized and in one

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,270
of the clusters you identify where

00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,800
anything she could only could kind of

00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:40,760
identify those well I I was just asking

00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,700
Jennings about how I saw that there's a

00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,440
connection here surely and from my

00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:50,360
understanding from Jennings those

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:53,480
corporates map in different ways so if

00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:56,090
it's really a dance effort by a few

00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,610
users that might come up is a kind of

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:01,880
remote event if they actually have locos

00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,860
mapping it might take further for a

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:08,390
while so it might not show up as an

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:11,270
event at all so I I would assume that

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,640
some of them are captured but really

00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:21,520
depends on the practices of that

00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:21,520
