for lightning talks so each of the spear

00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,580
they'll have five minutes and if you

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,200
could please

00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,390
hold all your questions at the end we'll

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,760
bring all the speakers back up if we

00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:29,170
have any time for four questions so

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:31,029
first up let's welcome David good

00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,599
morning Mabuhay I'm David from the

00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:33,820
Philippines

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,790
I live in altaira also known as New

00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,579
Zealand I don't have slides but imagine

00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,800
a map of the world with boundaries that

00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:44,920
are different than those that we use in

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,260
our OpenStreetMap we map the one that we

00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,329
we love I've been thinking about

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,820
indigenous mapping for a while I'm not

00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:54,730
an indigenous person but I'd like to be

00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,719
an ally how many of you here is an

00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:01,960
indigenous person who is an indigenous

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,680
person here there's no one and I think

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,330
that's a problem so I've been thinking

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,660
about this for a long time I'm kind of

00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,610
lost so I have some reflections that I'd

00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,200
like to read to you and maybe we can

00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,720
think about these things and have a long

00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:21,520
conversation this might even take years

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,870
I also make maps by the way okay number

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,060
one indigenous worldviews are

00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,460
fundamentally different from the the

00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,900
ontology and epistemology that we have

00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:34,240
in some cultures the boundaries are not

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,700
in the imagination like in our culture

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,930
in the Pacific my ancestor we didn't

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,360
have boundaries before the Spaniards

00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:43,150
came our islands were connected in our

00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,950
stick charts and the shells for our maps

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,770
and these are relationships and that's a

00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:51,490
fundamentally different type of

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:54,910
cartography is it cartography okay next

00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,950
I read the blog recently by Alan McCann

00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,620
cheese he said hey maybe it's time for

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,990
open street map to map indigenous lands

00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,930
and that's a nice idea and people have

00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:08,440
been doing it to a lesser greater extent

00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,899
but that's just there's a certain per or

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,040
a particular indigenous group want to be

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,810
mapped we have to think about that too

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,900
maybe there should be an OS M code for

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,390
refusal if they don't want to be mapped

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,330
then okay what do you think about that

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,430
and if mapping should happen then which

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,900
knowledge must remain hidden and which

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,849
knowledge must remain say

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,769
great because this is what they learned

00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:35,620
in out your aura I came there hey let's

00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:38,530
do om and then our Mari colleague said

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,739
well I don't know David you just came

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,709
and we have indigenous data sovereignty

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,629
which is a different concept than our

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,760
property model scheme that came from

00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,230
Europe

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,150
what does indigenous mapping mean and

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,250
take and are we supposed to be the map

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,849
makers of this particular type of

00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,379
initiative these are my last points ok

00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:02,139
so what do you think should we discuss

00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:05,139
how long does it take what should we do

00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,760
why for whom with whom what does this

00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:09,519
mean for both the social and technical

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,680
part of OpenStreetMap where are the

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:16,239
indigenous mappers of osm they are not

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,799
here and if they're not here

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,439
and we are going to prepare this space

00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,090
for for that moment when there's an

00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,549
indigenous mapper in the next state of

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,900
the map in the data working groups in

00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:28,329
the other working groups in the board

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,860
someday how can we be a good OSM

00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:36,559
ancestor thank you very much

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,559
[Applause]

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,370
mr. Kobe did drugs

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,370
yes

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:06,840
okay next please welcome disaster

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:08,910
mappers Heidelberg hi everyone thank you

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,530
all for being here and from disaster my

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,420
PA's Heidelberg we are a group of

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,340
researchers and students from Heidelberg

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,500
who are interested in OpenStreetMap

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,910
especially interested in humanitarian

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,700
street map we usually organize local map

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,740
Athens and sometimes hold workshops but

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,450
we've recently been met with a different

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,169
challenge that I would like to tell you

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:37,130
about in the next few minutes we've been

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:40,320
asked to gather all the sub-national

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,780
administrative units in osm sub-national

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,400
here meaning the administrative level

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:49,770
directly beneath the nation level and

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,280
that turned out to be quite a bit more

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,900
difficult than we imagined it to be

00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:00,570
because we want to join it with somatic

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:03,090
data joining is in general web very easy

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,490
from a technical perspective but from

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,289
the DEP at our perspective it's a little

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,210
bit more complicated because if you want

00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:13,350
to join two datasets you need to calm

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:15,780
attributes for every feature and that's

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,990
not so easy to find an open street map

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,979
because of sometimes illegally mapped

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,250
features therefore we need to improve

00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:28,200
the tagging in home street map first of

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,639
all I would like to tell you about some

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:35,250
methods we thought of for acquiring the

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,789
data who has heard of amber who was M

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,360
before

00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:46,590
Oh very few okay rambha who is M is a

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:50,250
site which was a boundaries service you

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:52,169
can see you can just click on the

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,260
nation's you can also expand them to

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:58,380
find the sub-national units and export

00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,740
them in a lot of formats it's a really

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,500
great site unfortunately it's not super

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,280
well fitted for exporting first of all

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:11,639
all the units and it also limits

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:15,020
matic data that can be exported so the

00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:18,330
next thing we thought about is overpass

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,900
it's lost it allows a very specific

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:24,180
query to be run you can ask for space

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,840
you can ask for thematic data you can

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:31,020
ask for users you can also ask for edits

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,510
and time slots the problem is it's not

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,720
really fit to handle a very large amount

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:40,350
of data all over the world so ok what do

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:45,030
we do next we download planets osm which

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:47,700
is all osm data the smallest you can get

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:51,720
it is almost 50 gigabytes so it's not

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:54,240
easy to handle if you want to know more

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,820
about what M data acquisition and

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,520
handling we have three different

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,530
workshop on was M data on a home page

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,340
these are some Apple Store 12 restore

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:08,250
calm slash mething I will also show the

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:12,360
shortest at the end okay so how are

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:14,550
batteries even checked usually the first

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,710
tool of the text that you see here are

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,280
the most important you need to take

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:22,640
boundary is administrative and the

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:27,120
administration level for the level

00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:31,979
directly beneath the state pins beneath

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:35,490
the beneath yeah Germany or UK for

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:38,039
example the states in the United States

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:40,470
are usually three or four four is much

00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,750
more common but you will also find three

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:46,229
so it there isn't a global standard for

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:49,229
this the name is obviously important as

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:54,440
well for us especially important is to

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:59,460
iso 3166 level two this is a standard

00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:04,410
that globally assigns a short string to

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,780
every sub-national in unit and this is

00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,120
what we would preferably use for our

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,130
joins because it has proven to be very

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,350
challenging to probably draw in on the

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:17,560
names because names sometimes

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:21,340
in English in your data set and native

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,760
in OpenStreetMap they sometimes contain

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,730
additions just as province or region or

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:31,750
state sometimes in English sometimes in

00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:35,560
native language so it's not easy to join

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,110
this it's also not easy to correct

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,050
yourself because it's almost 3,000

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:45,880
features you can also add more likely

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:49,450
key date English names or any names it's

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:52,360
best if you check your local units

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:55,210
because as I told you can be level 3 it

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,720
can be level 4 so it is good if you know

00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,310
the area where you're mapping note that

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,790
admin level is also used for government

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:06,540
buildings that that's important so is

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:11,530
really neat boundary administrative to

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:15,090
identify it we identify it almost 300

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:17,980
units with missing tags I upload a

00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:20,560
commerce abit values that high where you

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:24,790
can find the names the IDS in

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:27,010
OpenStreetMap so please feel free to

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:30,940
have a look at them and if you find any

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:34,120
that you know I would be very happy if

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:39,190
you can add some of the text that I told

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,900
you or that you can think of I'm very

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,170
thankful for your attendance and any

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:46,090
help you can give us you can find us on

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,680
disaster my post-punk wordpress taught

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:51,940
wordpress calm you can find us on

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,230
twitter and reach us on via email the

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,210
workshops that i mentioned earlier are

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,210
also on the homepage thank you very much

00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,179
[Applause]

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:23,180
okay next we're gonna hear from Toshi

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:27,910
kazoo out map compare a good Amorian

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:33,110
everyone and talk about only you can

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:37,030
memory to map compare JP just runs three

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,270
days ago so I'm honored to talk about

00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,060
this

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:44,750
Germany state of the map conference to

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:49,280
launch up compare Japanese version right

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:52,370
so anyway our Japanese researcher group

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,820
focus on the trust of the crowd-sourced

00:10:52,370 --> 00:11:01,450
geographical information Sciences last

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:04,940
years ago so we are now analysis truth

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,610
so not only the opposite map data but

00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:10,610
also the bridge I had a quality

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:16,840
assessment and also we are focused on

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:21,500
user motivation so anyway we just

00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:26,240
started to launch the Japan map compare

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:31,580
and also we can you access to happy to

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:35,030
have to any code so head of the

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:38,780
developing map compare Japanese version

00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:43,340
the this site can compare various web

00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:47,450
Maps focus on the recent rehear that all

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:50,750
the web map services of course the Open

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:55,610
Street Map and being Google easily and

00:11:50,750 --> 00:12:00,370
in Japanese map agency can publish the

00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:04,670
map fan and also the geospatial

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:08,390
geospatial information Institute of the

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:11,450
Japanese mapped agency it is also the

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,000
inspired by the original map compare

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:17,270
coded by the G fabrics

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,190
thank you so much to geo fabric have

00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:24,069
aside right it is developed using the

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:27,819
when mapping technology likely Freight

00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:30,879
the bilges and also that you can show

00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:34,600
the handle be as a node.js application

00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:38,680
so this site was developed with me

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:43,120
remain in Japanese but come pre so focus

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:48,069
on opposite map data so anyway we can

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:51,819
now access to a computer JP and also our

00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:58,410
site is compared even when map contents

00:12:51,819 --> 00:13:04,920
about the max maximum is 8 padam to

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:10,300
recently map shows so anyway we can now

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:13,240
develop link to the static links so

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:17,350
panels and zooms and that should not

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:21,160
choose sounds web map patterns to memory

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:28,600
memorize to you can use this zone and

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:33,420
also your scalable to lead to be a

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:37,389
smartphone application you can show some

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:41,790
compared to the read maps to using this

00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:49,660
not form so anyway our map compare

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:55,750
license is this by the BSD license so

00:13:49,660 --> 00:14:00,220
you can always shows and use using our

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:02,589
map compute JP website so I think again

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:09,819
for original harm up compare developed

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:21,600
by Joe fabric so anyway to show me the

00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:21,600
video so you can compare to the some we

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:33,640
attached some map services of course we

00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:37,030
are proud to next stage to other

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:40,960
map web map services it's included this

00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:45,790
site so not only you can shows in

00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:49,180
Japanese area but also this version is a

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:53,650
worldwide show how about only the

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:59,560
Japanese area to be much to wait better

00:14:53,650 --> 00:15:09,280
data set so you can show this is a four

00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:15,690
screen and that's six type of screen

00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:17,500
type and maximum of size is eight sites

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,190
okay

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,580
please touch our application so thank

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,580
you so much

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:42,330
our fourth speaker is Italian about

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,330
quick OSM

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:15,899
hiya good morning everyone I'm going to

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:15,899
show you two tools but I'm working on

00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:38,840
keep yeah no problem so I'm going to

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,650
show you two tools that I'm working on

00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:45,010
to use osm the recent vector data in qgs

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,630
so the first one is called docker osm I

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:51,130
can't explain to you what is to occur

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:54,560
but dock USM is like post gist database

00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:57,320
with automatic updates of the OSM

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,840
database so it's a docker compose

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,180
project with free containers in it so

00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,880
you have employ same post GIS or a same

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,070
update so the idea is like quite simple

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,830
you take just one a simple PDF file and

00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:12,440
you put it in a specific folder of

00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:14,810
docker SM and you just press I mean you

00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,720
just do make run and the idea is like

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:20,740
your PDF file is imported into the

00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:25,250
Pastis database so you have all your

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:27,350
your layers created following what you

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,590
did in the employ same default

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:33,230
configuration and automatically every

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:36,980
two minutes this system will be updated

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,870
with the live OS m data and it's

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,690
possible to customize this configuration

00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:45,470
so you can set up like custom URL for

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:47,930
the defiles default update interval you

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,760
can also add some extra SQL queries like

00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:53,360
if you want to have some index triggers

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,970
views and also some QG styles are

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,950
included in the database so when you

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:01,220
load them from huges you may have like

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:03,890
some default styles already so it's on

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,320
github like you have the address that's

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,930
the first tool that I'm using to use

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,830
vector data will in qgs and the other

00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:16,400
one is a plug-in so you can either work

00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:23,150
with local PDF files also or you can use

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:25,970
queries with overpass overpass so you

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,920
can ask one key like I mean by default

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:30,200
we download all our send data if you let

00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,030
the key and the value empty when you can

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,120
define one key or one value that you

00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,520
want to query with the overpass then for

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,250
the extent we try to do what

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,810
overpass tuber is doing so you may like

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,180
have in around

00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:46,550
like in a specific area or you can have

00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:51,950
you can use layer extent map convey

00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:53,630
extent and quicker ISM is also providing

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,520
some default actions that some people

00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:01,340
may not know like but if you want like

00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:04,430
you can edit osm features and it will

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:07,550
lounge over ID order awesome straight

00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:09,500
from huges and quick way we also pass

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,630
the data that you download it so if you

00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,110
have like some map really not purely map

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,430
you ready

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:18,710
a map in our your links or Wikipedia or

00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:23,690
wiki data it will just like offer user

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:27,080
link to open the web page or here you

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:31,970
can see that just openings go to

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:36,560
mapillary plugin then if you already

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:39,500
like used awesome data within huges you

00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:42,320
usually have this ash tor field in huges

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:45,410
it's not very convenient to work with so

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,690
just keep in mind that you can either

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:50,570
use quick osm to load your local file it

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:53,540
will just explode h2o field or start

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:57,290
using huge ease 3.4 3.6 there is no like

00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:59,810
a better support for h store field so it

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:03,320
will explode your i mean there is a

00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:07,420
native algorithm in qg c qg 3.6 where

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:10,730
you can explode your H store field and

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:13,160
also you can also include is build some

00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,740
graphical models so I don't know if you

00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,900
are used to it you can like build some

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:21,140
models with some inputs some algorithm

00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,270
and some outputs so you can use quickly

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,790
same within the graphical model builder

00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,760
so for instance a I'm just using one

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:30,830
input it's an extent when I'd say okay

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,720
I'm building a query so it's a minute

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:38,480
equal sorry emergency equal fire hydrant

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,750
then I'm downloading the query and I'm

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,060
like the query will come in 43:26 with

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,370
degrees so I want everything in meters

00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,420
so I'm just doing a reproduction in my

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,620
local

00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:53,810
CRS and I'm doing a buffering so I get

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,780
then at the end like two layers one for

00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:57,870
five hundred and one

00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,210
area so when you have like you just you

00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,550
can have some presets with some queries

00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,290
already like saved in your queue geez so

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,390
I just double click on fire hydrant on

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,400
the right and then the model will

00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:11,670
execute by itself and I have two layers

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,920
at the end so you can like just use

00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:17,330
every algorithm from quit from huges

00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:21,600
like buffering reprojection intersection

00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:23,490
and yeah so I'm always looking for ell

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,340
translations documentation z'

00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:29,250
i have plenty of ideas for quick ways

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,810
i'm like to have like mad presets where

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,200
you don't need like to know the key is a

00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:39,330
value to have like from for instance

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:42,300
bicycle maps integrate gsm presets also

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:45,150
whatever well I have some ideas so yeah

00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,830
that's it it's a variable on qgs and on

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:54,820
github also

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:57,350
[Applause]

00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,210
thank you so we do have a couple minutes

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,970
for questions so if the speaker's want

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:04,610
to all come up here we can take a couple

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,870
questions and then after this is the

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:10,779
coffee break so you can also find the

00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,779
speakers there so any question

00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:34,030
okay I further quick Oh Sam is there is

00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:39,100
a easy way to import in the docker OSM

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:46,270
with our own schema not a impose awesome

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:49,060
schema docker is same I was just using

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:52,120
the default employ same file but that's

00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,610
you can customize it when you download

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:58,330
the project you can customize layers

00:22:54,610 --> 00:23:00,670
that you want attributes tags and if you

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:12,460
want a generalized version of your table

00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:16,030
that's all possible in in poison yes I

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:18,010
hope I have a remark and a question for

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:21,480
the first speaker you're raising a very

00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:24,930
important point of mapping indigenous

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,490
people and indigenous people territories

00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,500
I'm afraid you're posing questions that

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:33,070
cannot be answered in general you know

00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,350
they are very location specific and and

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:39,310
one question that I would like to pose

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:43,240
to you is the following as OpenStreetMap

00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:46,300
is trying to near completion in local

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,970
context the question is going to be

00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:52,000
whether the data that we have is

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,730
perceived from an open world perspective

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,980
or from a closed world perspective and

00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:02,290
what is meant by that is whether you can

00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:06,190
assume that what is not there it doesn't

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:10,120
really exist and and you know in the

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,860
open world perspective you you don't

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,710
believe that you think there's always

00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,720
more in the closed world perspective you

00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:20,170
assume what you have is all that's there

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,970
and that is a very fundamental point

00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:26,200
that you need to raise when you come to

00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:28,090
indigenous peoples mapping because it's

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,010
really it will tell you something about

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:34,240
that and what is important there

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:36,160
is what is the what is the law of the

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,580
country telling you are the indigenous

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:43,720
peoples rights and with that you can

00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:46,120
possibly play this and so to come back

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,679
to give you an example of this you pose

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,799
us the question are you in

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,570
are there any indigenous people here and

00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:54,790
I was posing myself the question well

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:57,610
define indigenous for me because you

00:24:54,790 --> 00:25:00,340
know I feel like I'm indigenous to where

00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:02,380
I live because I was born there and all

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,799
my family was born there but I don't

00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:08,169
think you meant that yeah so you know

00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:12,250
what does it mean to be not indigenous

00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:15,070
it's a reverse question so my question

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:17,049
to you is does this what I just said

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:20,190
does this apply to your the case that

00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:25,809
you have in front of you

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:28,840
how are people's rights absorbed in the

00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:31,210
in the local law is there are there

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:36,070
sentiments for not being mapped and what

00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:38,640
would those be thanks for that I can at

00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,900
least even in a tangential way respond

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,580
first if it's about the open and closed

00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,110
world perspective I think we also need

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,620
to think thank you for that these are

00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,950
wonderful

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:51,730
this is wonderful inside I think we need

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:53,740
to also ask about the basis of that why

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,600
why is it open what does it mean was

00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,169
disclosed mean because it comes from a

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,460
particular value system just to add

00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:03,340
because when whenever I talk with our

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:07,360
digital colleagues even map makers they

00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:11,559
say well I know David to come you

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,120
studied this GIS etc but in our

00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,460
community not everything has to be

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:20,710
shared to the world and maybe that's the

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:22,179
way it is about the thing that's in

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,179
front of me what's in front of me I

00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:27,220
think is maybe a conversation that's all

00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:29,740
I can do again I am NOT trying to lead

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,530
an initiative or etcetera but I think

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,940
there has to be a conversation and the

00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,470
things that you said maybe it depends on

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,980
the country maybe it depends on their

00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,600
laws what does it mean to be indigenous

00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,040
and even there were determined is honest

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,800
is very spirit

00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,510
entry maybe it's case case basis maybe

00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,620
this is not the responsibility of

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,870
OpenStreetMap

00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:54,290
it's also possible maybe there has to be

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:59,600
another group that could sound

00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:02,170
provocative to you but whenever I I go

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,700
to other communities well David if you

00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:07,100
trace our buildings the military's gonna

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,450
come and bump our village and they're

00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,290
gonna get our forests and they're gonna

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:14,870
get our minds and okay I'm gonna step

00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:17,330
back and not make a map so these are

00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:20,180
just thoughts I'm also kind of lost

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,600
right now but thank you for that thank

00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,600
you very much

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:45,410
