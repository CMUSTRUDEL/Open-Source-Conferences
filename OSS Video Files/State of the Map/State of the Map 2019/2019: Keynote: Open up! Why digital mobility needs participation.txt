Baden-Württemberg’s Ministry of Transport aims at developing regional mobility data towards an open and interoperable framework for new mobility solutions - as part of a sustainable traffic system, realising efficiency, climate protection and living quality. On the way there, fair chances for innovation are key: Not only for better results but also for a the involvement of most different societal actors. Cross-thinking and open innovation are corner stones in such a process.

Baden-Württemberg’s Ministry of Transport aims at developing regional mobility data towards an open and interoperable framework for new mobility solutions - as part of a sustainable traffic system, realising efficiency, climate protection and living quality. On the way there, fair chances for innovation are key: Not only for better results but also for a the involvement of most different societal actors. Cross-thinking and open innovation are corner stones in such a process. 

The keynote speech develops the need for open innovation against the background of the concept of sustainable mobility. It also gives insight into participation in innovation projects and the use of Open Street Map as a sustainable and non-discriminatory digital basis for new mobility.

dear Methos dear guests and participants

00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:16,120
of the state of the map too

00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,800
my colleagues and me at the Ministry of

00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,140
Transport were pretty happy to have

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,050
state of the map 2019 taking place right

00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,210
in front of our home door because we as

00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,010
a public institution with a mission to

00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,680
organize traffic and transport in a

00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,450
better way what is better it's more

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,520
sustainable it's more secure and it's

00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,080
some other things as well we really much

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,300
appreciate OpenStreetMap as a

00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,030
contribution to the digital world we

00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:43,989
also use OpenStreetMap ourselves in our

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:47,920
own use cases in how daily work I will

00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:52,860
come to that later but before welcome

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,860
Chabad miltenberg welcome to Heidelberg

00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,330
before I come to OpenStreetMap and the

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,309
question why digital solutions in the

00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,299
field of mobility need openness and

00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:03,790
participation

00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:06,360
let me first dive into mobility and say

00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:10,450
some things about the shifts and changes

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,180
mobility is facing today welcome to bar

00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,280
nutmeg also means welcome to a place of

00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,020
the cornerstones of traditional mobility

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,420
not far away from here in the city of

00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,860
Mannheim is like 20 minutes drive or

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,890
something

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,690
both the automobile and the bicycle have

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,610
been invented the bicycle more than 200

00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,030
years ago and back then still without

00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,770
pedals today you stuff like that for

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,640
kids learning them teaching them how to

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,860
ride bikes and especially the car is

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,480
still a part of the regional identity

00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,340
here in the southwest of Germany which

00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,590
certainly has to do with a strong

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,730
automotive industry around here with

00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:50,260
mercy to spends parts of OD poor she

00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:53,920
called the D like Bosch sitting here in

00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,500
Bonn back however mobility today

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,690
certainly is much more than just the car

00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,159
of the bicycle

00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,409
welcome to the mobility environment MEC

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,020
also means welcome to diversified world

00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,960
where we have new forms of mobility new

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,269
services new behaviors of mobility

00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,760
especially in the urban areas it is a

00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:14,500
mixture of different modes of transport

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,930
in a mixture of both individual

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,060
transport solutions beat the car or the

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,040
bicycle and new forms of public

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,879
transport like ride pooling like

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,329
ride-sharing

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,490
and this new mobility includes great

00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:30,400
chances for better living quality we

00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,260
and for more efficiency in the usage of

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,360
our public infrastructure and that can

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,870
easily be illustrated when we take a

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,460
closer look at again the car the sort of

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,220
graph here is classic and the mobility

00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,870
debate it's I don't know when it was

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,180
taken it's probably when you take a look

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,890
at the cars from the late 1970s 1980s

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,260
and I don't think I have to say too much

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,140
about it's just an illustration how many

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,600
space cars need in cities and how few

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,670
people are actually being transported

00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,350
with those cars look at the same amount

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,910
of people and how much space of bus

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,870
where they all can fit in or some

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:07,480
bicycles use and you see that also in

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:10,120
figures and facts about the car three

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,900
figures about the car about car mobility

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:17,560
in cities 23 hours 30 percent one point

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:22,870
two persons the average car your average

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:27,010
car maybe is being parked 23 hours of 24

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:28,750
hours a day and this is basically the

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,730
result yeah that's that's how it looks

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,460
like in my own street where I live in

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:37,120
Stuttgart it's the same problem 30

00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,740
percent up to 30 percent of the

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,390
inner-city traffic with all the

00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,250
congestion with all the traffic jams

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,190
with all the air pollution we have there

00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:49,180
is generated just by people looking for

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,710
a parking place not even doing transport

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,010
themselves just looking where to park

00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,690
the car another number which I didn't

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,090
put on here the normal car has four

00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,390
seats but only one point two persons are

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,350
in average really occupying these seats

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:07,030
in the morning and in the evening

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:09,940
traffic during rush hours so what can

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,370
you forms of mobility do about it about

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,290
this inefficiency new ability solutions

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,690
like right cooling and ride-sharing

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,480
which are most things that are made

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,950
possible at all by digitalization can

00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,870
increase efficiency can increase

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,750
occupancy rates of course of the cars

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,390
and it's the digitalization as well that

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,970
really lowers the barriers and to use

00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:35,230
public forms of transport to book a

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:37,360
train to take bus to find out how you

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,449
get from here to your hotel by using

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,319
public transport but

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:44,550
we are pretty clear about the fact that

00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,770
digitalization in mobility is something

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,300
we need to work on another example is

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,069
the autonomous driving which is

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,439
something that something that is really

00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:55,770
highlighted in the debate and at least

00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,710
by actors out of the out of the private

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:02,729
sector out of the out of the industry

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:05,780
but with autonomous robot cars in

00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:08,580
divisions like that you could easily

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,270
even lower the occupancy rate of course

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,580
even further

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,379
think about autonomous cars floating

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,840
around freely and autonomously

00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,669
themselves maybe because the guy owning

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,310
that car just couldn't find a place to

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:23,069
park and it could have even below one

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,139
person in average in the car so

00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,120
digitalization doesn't necessarily make

00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,840
it better and here we are right in the

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,370
middle of the digitalization debate you

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,590
all know about the fancy and shiny

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,689
[Music]

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,189
technological examples and use cases

00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:40,110
digitalization brings with itself I'm

00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:41,460
personally a social scientist and a

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,589
political scientist and so I'm

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,879
especially interested in the social

00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:48,389
dimension about it

00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,789
and you can easily see digitalization as

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:54,289
something social digitalization is

00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:56,669
social as well because it changes

00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:59,729
resources to act it is a recalibration

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:02,240
of societal powers it brings in new

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:05,219
actors and maybe kicks out old ones

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,800
again an example from traffic this is

00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:10,229
the classical way how traffic management

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,330
where traffic management used to be a

00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:14,669
public authority came along a set of a

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:19,199
road sign like this thing Heidelberg go

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:20,490
this way or in this case and we are

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,139
right in the middle of the

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,699
transformation from traffic management

00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:28,229
to traffic self-management this is the

00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,389
way traffic management and cities

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,810
basically looks today people are driving

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,610
around with their own little assistant

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:39,240
the smartphone or it can be the on-board

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,699
unit of cars well it's more or less

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,819
personalized but who actually stands

00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,439
behind such a digital assistant it's not

00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,630
the society it's not a public

00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,259
institution that has the permission a

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:54,320
car to act according to a public in

00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,660
it's the private sector it's it's

00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,639
suddenly the private sector influencing

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,280
traffic management much more than it

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,900
used to be and companies of course have

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,250
to act according to their own interests

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,110
they have to act according to the

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,000
particular interests in order to take

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,979
money and so on and there's nothing bad

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,070
about it I mean they they they have to

00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:14,600
do it but of course the world is not

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,389
that simple it's not a question about

00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,370
black against white about good against

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,440
evil and there's much more than just the

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,380
good public institutions on the other

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,449
side and the innovative private economy

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,690
digging in there on the other side and

00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:31,610
of course we know that the public

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,199
institution like I work and can be

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,360
really inefficient and normally we're

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
not the first ones to pick up innovative

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,100
ideas and new technologies and on the

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,080
other hand private economy brings in you

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,440
are really good new ideas that can do

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,300
something about and ability problems but

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,080
there's much more of course there's the

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,000
research and there's the civil society

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,130
getting new possibilities to affect

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,650
Shutts such crucial fields of action

00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:00,770
like mobility due to digitalization and

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:04,099
something like OpenStreetMap met made by

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:07,520
everybody for everybody is well barely

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:11,000
conceivable without digital technology

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,760
in an open approach to digitalization

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,400
like osm is living it barriers are no to

00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,409
use a service and it is easy to

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,750
influence a service and to make

00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:22,760
something out of it as well the open

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,710
approach mera effects like the wisdom of

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,750
the crowd the participation of large

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,090
groups that helped you ensure quality

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:32,570
for example and there's nonprofit

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,339
orientation in it there's something like

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,229
a public interest that gets in it as

00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:39,830
well or let me put it in a even bigger

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:44,720
word the walk receipt you don't have to

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:47,209
say too much about it well I hope God

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,100
already clear that we do not want to do

00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:51,790
digitalization because we think

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,959
everything digital is better we see

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,100
digitalization as an element and

00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:59,060
sustainability and we see a

00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,870
digitalization base that is made

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,750
sustainable

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,760
a prerequisite for something else for

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,180
well use like safety like efficiency

00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:11,450
labor and innovation something that if

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,800
it's done in a good way ensures fairness

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,730
and availability for all and therefore

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,950
sustainability and sustainable

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,870
digitalization would be something that

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,850
ensures future competitiveness and

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,880
living quality and it's not something

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:29,870
that is begins the opposite of an

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,240
economical competitiveness one of the

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,840
most important fields to act there is

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,790
probably climate policy one more number

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,830
1 million nine hundred and thousand tons

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:46,280
that is the difference of greenhouse gas

00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:50,720
emissions in the german transport sector

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,310
between 2016 and 2017 and there's no

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,770
good news about it it's only bad news

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:58,910
because the difference is positive it's

00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:00,560
actually an increase and everyone to get

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,390
on the right track if you want to live

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,760
up to the goal of being climbing

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,400
neutrally in 2015 there's really stony

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,360
past lying ahead of us and there are

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,920
really intensive dimensions of change

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,720
there's a lot of calculation that shows

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,840
what a lone bond miltenberg what he

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,230
would have to do to live up to the goals

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,560
in climate policy alone in the next 10

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:26,990
years until 2030 would mean doubling the

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,100
amount of public transport compared to

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:33,530
today one in three cars must draw would

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,980
have to drive climate neutrally today

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:39,740
it's below 1% of electronic records in

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:43,130
baden-württemberg every third ton in

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,190
logistics would have to be a transported

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,870
land literally half of all journeys

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,450
would have to be done self actively so

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:55,160
by foot and by bike and in total we

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:58,760
would need 1/3 fewer cars in towns and

00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,010
in cities so what does all this have to

00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,680
do with digitalization and with the

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,850
OpenStreetMap and how can digital

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,790
participation help us to shape better

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,100
mobility and more and more sustainable

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:14,020
mobility let me emphasize two aspects

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:17,120
again quality innovation

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,490
first we see the the open and

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,040
participatory approach of OS m as

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,990
something like quality management I took

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,120
I talked about the wisdom of crowd of

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,790
the crowds earlier we really believed in

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,649
the idea that a map that is updated by

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,649
thousands and thousands of members of

00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:35,870
something that is precise something that

00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:38,630
is reliable something that avoids

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,120
mistakes and second making people to

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:44,240
participate means to foster innovation

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,550
because the participation of

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,459
entrepreneurs research large and small

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:52,089
companies and just the normal you and I

00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:55,010
gives the chance for whole new ideas

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:57,290
quantity precision reliability

00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,899
innovation new ideas all those are

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:03,220
things we certainly need when we want to

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:05,810
shape a better mobility for the future

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,050
I'd like to make a little cut at this

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,970
point of the presentation and dive into

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,790
some of the use cases we have but I need

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,890
some help with that so we have deep ma

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,050
around here deep mazayef at he's working

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:21,589
for the bond Whittenburg transport

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:23,750
authority and he's much better in

00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,800
explaining the technical stuff when when

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,950
I am so here you go

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,950
[Applause]

00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:39,870
hello and I have two use cases one is

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:43,050
from the LST first example is wrote

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:46,019
rocks information systems or short bis

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:49,230
to foreign Germany both an information

00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:51,720
system to which is currently developed

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,290
by Sal and Estella for consultation so

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,910
you'll see sir English translations

00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,000
OpenStreetMap data is not only used as a

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,940
very up-to-date background map layer but

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,250
also to easily enter a rotatable

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,670
diversion recommendations during route

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,920
for instructions to detect contradict

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,980
conflicts with roadworks and third

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,319
parties or in known locations of

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,829
roadworks and constructions Amit unser

00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:21,899
OpenStreetMap Network map matching so

00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:24,300
official classified road network

00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,970
whistles and street network already

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,880
provided many insights in the quality

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:32,399
data quality issues both the

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,880
constructions and deviation data as well

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,920
as detected quality issues and further

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,110
datasets will be published as open data

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,790
in the next months for a few more

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:48,600
details come to the lightning talks

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:53,339
tomorrow as a DVD the second example is

00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:57,569
in the company employee is a time

00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:59,790
information system IVA PV for electron

00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:02,250
ship house comprising africa situation

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,500
of written back before ready service he

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,550
collects actual and real-time data from

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,980
trains and from buses from our local

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:13,290
transport agencies collect data together

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:17,010
and offer a countrywide information

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:21,050
systems to apps to a website and to the

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:24,899
public transport assign sponsor stops

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:29,490
one current project is based on a German

00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:32,880
in insert system we use it was a main

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:36,000
Network and important point of interest

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,060
for searching and for routing from every

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,389
start to every endpoint as a result will

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,999
be shown

00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:46,179
on the OSM related map until end of this

00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:48,309
year one current project is based on a

00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:51,459
German law called a zone before Thomas

00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:54,429
cadets nucleus that local public

00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:57,339
transport must be usable for people with

00:14:54,429 --> 00:15:00,389
limited mobility possibilities as of the

00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:02,769
gain of 2022

00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:05,619
therefore all train stations and bus

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:08,920
stops must be evaluated hope area free

00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:11,649
you save will say are in part wooden

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:14,799
black we have one we have eleven hundred

00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:18,369
stations and about so it is Ruiz bus

00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:21,730
stops this evolution must be done by

00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:24,249
every country in Germany so result in

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,259
open verdict will be input to the time

00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:28,749
tab information system to give the

00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:31,319
answer if and how at rapid chain is

00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:34,360
usable for people with limited mobility

00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:37,239
possibilities we will offer the results

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,029
and the pictures we assume five hundred

00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:44,350
thousand pictures as open datasets for

00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:45,910
public use at last I want to give you a

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,910
very short information about our

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:51,639
recently open data activities during the

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:53,649
last months for our open data sets we

00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,959
use at Romani data license we share

00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:57,850
alike and attribution what was an

00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:02,230
additional osm closed who use it

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:04,779
directly in of awesome for our open we

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,169
offer information about bus stops train

00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:11,939
stations with a lot of details and

00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:11,939
provide secure data in GTFS vomit

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,139
one of the biggest attempts we are

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:29,279
currently undertaking is called Moby

00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:33,509
data BW mu B data bond written back so I

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:35,519
mean in German we say BB it's really

00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:39,329
complicated with a W in it but

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,519
nevertheless movie day w w is the vision

00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:45,089
to develop a single access point for

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,309
mobility data right now we are quite

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:48,990
good and integrating mobility data for

00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:51,569
the road sector on the one side on the

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:54,180
one hand and the public transport sector

00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:58,290
including the trains on the other hand

00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:00,029
and the road sector we're quite ok in

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,910
providing open data and in the public

00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:06,029
sector we are slowly getting better at

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,159
least and the vision of mobi data BW is

00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:11,069
to integrate both and to combine it with

00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:13,799
whole new mobility data not only to

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:15,779
concentrate on the public side unlike

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,929
ourselves the data we have

00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:21,839
anyway but to combine it with data from

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:23,640
the private economy first from the

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,309
sharing sector with car sharing data

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,909
right pooling ride-sharing bike sharing

00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:31,830
a scooter data and so on and so forth we

00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:34,649
try to get started with that with like

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,919
like partners that are willing to

00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:40,220
participate and try to get better and

00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:43,260
and bigger and we also combine this data

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,570
with information from small and medium

00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,399
sized cities because coming back to the

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,500
example of traffic management the way

00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:52,200
traffic management often works in

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,659
smaller cities that are often enough

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,429
highly affected by nobility problems at

00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:57,779
least from their closer to bigger city

00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:00,690
where you have all the commuters coming

00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,700
in so the way traffic management works

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,289
there is often enough just to set up a

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,909
road so I'm going the digital way

00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:08,149
because there are not at all the

00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:11,490
resources to really use digital

00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:13,140
technology with high-end modes of

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,020
traffic influence like we have it in

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:21,299
cities like Stuttgart Heidelberg maybe

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:24,299
and with mobi data BW we offer them a

00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:27,980
really easy browser-based to where they

00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:30,659
can digitalize their own ideas about

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,700
traffic influence about how people

00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:33,460
should get routing information according

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,640
to

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:41,590
ideas like less air pollution more road

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:44,200
safety and so on on that platform basis

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:48,100
our goal is to provide both single

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:51,220
datasets for use of third parties but

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,740
also providing routing information that

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:58,120
can then be used and integrated in other

00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:00,490
services and yeah the fact that osm is

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,340
the map basis of this is not the only

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:06,340
participatory element because of course

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,620
we want to have as many part takers on

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,620
the data give a basis but we also want

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,480
to have as many people as many

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,820
institutions as possible actually doing

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,980
something new something in knowledge of

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,010
making trial and error about better and

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,910
new mobility with this data so to put it

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,950
in a nutshell

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,770
this is the attempt to build up a

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,200
digital innovation ecosystem for

00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,910
sustainable mobility a big attempt who

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,010
are only getting started with that but

00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:37,840
yeah we're giving our best and let's see

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:40,540
who where it leads us ok one more thing

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,660
my boss the Minister of Transport of

00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:46,480
infeed Hammond can't be here today but

00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:49,480
this these ideas is something he really

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,460
tries to live up to as well and he

00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,110
really knows about these these things

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:57,070
we're doing here and so we have a

00:19:53,110 --> 00:20:00,340
digital way ladies and gentlemen dear

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:05,290
guests the state of the map conference

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:08,410
of 2019 takes place in Heidelberg were

00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:11,610
the sharing of knowledge as part of the

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:15,850
city's identity for more than 600 years

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:18,670
I'm pleased to support this event and

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:23,230
would like to say a very warm welcome to

00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:26,530
all participants of the conference the

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:30,420
open availability and accessibility for

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:33,580
the data created by citizen for citizens

00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:36,370
under nonprofit concept is a rare

00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:40,480
innovation based on which we need to

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:42,130
build not only can OpenStreetMap be used

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,490
as another

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:51,010
but also as a digital foundation for new

00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:53,220
and sustainable mobility services this

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:56,679
is one reason why

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:59,440
OpenStreetMap data has already found its

00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:03,549
way into many of our own projects and

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:08,309
services OpenStreetMap has become an

00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:11,650
indispensable part of digital mobility

00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:13,960
the Ministry of Transport for example

00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:17,320
uses this high-quality data as a

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:21,280
background in cyclopath Maps for a

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,169
planning of construction sites and in

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,720
the development of mobility platform

00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:30,909
based on the open data principle in a

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,390
world that is becoming more and more

00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:37,809
digital the provision of data for the

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:41,049
public is particularly important the

00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:44,260
exchange of information is a cornerstone

00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:47,409
of a new mobility that is sustainable

00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:52,270
and ready for the future I'm very sure

00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:55,870
that the state of the map 2019 will been

00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:59,039
excellent exchanged forum thank you very

00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,039
much good luck

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,150
so we'd like to end our presentation

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,460
with a quote that pretty much pretty

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,590
much sums up why digital mobility should

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,780
be open its body its ball the Danish

00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:20,690
resists it says the best weapon of

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:24,520
dictatorship secrecy and the best weapon

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:27,559
of democracy is openness when we shape

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:30,760
digitalization for better world OSM

00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:43,130
helps us not to forget this

00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:45,590
thank you talk about talk about

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,410
participation thank you we've got some

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:53,110
time for some questions if anyone is

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:58,040
eager to us these goes a question at all

00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:59,390
yeah give him on my side thank you there

00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,850
was a wonderful presentation I have

00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,970
found especially interesting your

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:07,400
initiatives around making public data or

00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:12,110
data publicly available the open data

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,960
initiative for public transport and road

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:17,929
transport etc etc my question is to what

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,600
extent do you share with other Buddhist

00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:23,170
Linda with other states in Germany or

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,239
perhaps even on a European Union level

00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,239
[Music]

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:34,490
the central state level Paris for the

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,230
rotator and own data platform which is

00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,630
called the mobility data marketplace

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:41,330
Germany mobility aid start locknuts

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:43,309
so there the data is integrated already

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,200
and we also use that national platform

00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:47,299
for our own attempts like movie data

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,340
maybe because it's like like doing a

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:51,740
phone call with with a cell phone we

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,230
send up data there and take it back and

00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:58,100
integrate it and combine it in a new way

00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,990
for for our use and for the public

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,240
transport sector maybe you would like to

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:10,280
say some things about Fe or stuff like

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:13,940
that and Delfy is looking how which what

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:17,059
is we have yes we have law in Germany it

00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:21,050
is not very clear if they can publish

00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:24,200
all the data because as countries have

00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:27,410
to write but they make some modification

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,429
and aggregation and say I think it has a

00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,419
right to publish acute voice our own

00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:36,790
there is something happening in the

00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:39,650
background but if not they publish all

00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:43,720
publish all public transport companies

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:48,159
must offer us

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:51,220
Suchitra data to 1st of december this

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:55,419
year so they need some popular formats

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,710
for example GTFS and though we have in

00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:01,480
the next few years

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:06,759
some European laws which shows as a

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:10,570
public public the public authority must

00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:15,190
open the data so it is December and in

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:19,299
two years nearly all data must be open

00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:20,710
data by default and with the public

00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:22,929
transport sector we actually have the

00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:26,350
problem that whole landscape is really a

00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:30,129
heterogeneous we have a lot of transport

00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:32,679
associations and on the law side it's

00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:36,399
really complicated who actually has the

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:46,090
right to to open up that data so that's

00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:49,049
certainly very left question or you just

00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,049
need to raise your voice

00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,990
thanks for the interesting presentation

00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:56,409
that I'm interested in how your

00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:59,710
collaboration with OpenStreetMap worked

00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:01,559
out in in practice like was there any

00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:04,559
entities you were working with together

00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:08,860
part of the foundation for example or

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,419
just local chapters and also if you have

00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,539
any suggestions on how we can improve

00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:16,059
like is there anything you're missing

00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:23,379
and working together with government

00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:27,039
agencies cetera we want to communicate

00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:32,409
with a community at this time is this my

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:35,470
part but we will do it with we make we

00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:39,279
will use it as more people we will do

00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:42,490
heck at once and it's very important for

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:47,230
us that if we offer you open datasets

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:51,039
that we get back so feedback so at this

00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:52,929
time we got a very good feedback how the

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,120
ecology of our data is and it is not

00:26:52,929 --> 00:27:00,190
really good because we collect

00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:03,100
from 22 local agencies and there's no

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:06,130
high standard for the key standard on

00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,830
the whole country so this is homework

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:13,540
class to make sure that the quality

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:17,890
volectro but it's we are very open for

00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:20,740
the great critic and this is what

00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,920
personally every is important that we

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:27,640
see what happens for the data and what

00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:32,380
is so value of this if you give it to

00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:34,360
its public but we around two years ago

00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,310
we started to have a paradigm shift as a

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,650
public institution from the classical

00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:41,560
way here's the data of the state do with

00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:43,990
it whatever you want to a participatory

00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,760
and collaborative way to do it so we did

00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:50,010
first think tanks together with the

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,570
community we did a larger hackathon in

00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:54,910
2018 I think it was and we're planning

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,740
similarly when for next year we want to

00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:59,470
get together with expert teams from

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,330
research from civil society provide them

00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:09,310
with resources and work with them

00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:13,930
together on the data what important for

00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:17,860
the future is how the channel between us

00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:24,340
would function on a decayed information

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:27,280
if we put out a stop data we have 33,000

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:29,500
ID knows that not every bus stop is in

00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:34,870
reality there where it should be it is

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:37,990
in our data and so we want to create a

00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:40,270
website or some other application to

00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:43,480
give the OpenStreetMap also other public

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:47,590
community suppose ability to say here is

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:50,890
not a bus stop or information we gave to

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:54,760
the public it's not that it's not so

00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:58,450
recently correctly so we need to add

00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:01,290
some apps also to communicate together

00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:05,250
and we wanted to use and standard

00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:05,250
mailing lists or forum

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:14,600
okay I might accept one more question

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:16,400
yes there is one notes so we take these

00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,390
guys again thank you for coming along

00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,390
