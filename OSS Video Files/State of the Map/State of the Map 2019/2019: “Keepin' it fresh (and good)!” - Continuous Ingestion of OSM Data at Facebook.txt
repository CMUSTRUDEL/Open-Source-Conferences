Title: 2019: “Keepin' it fresh (and good)!” - Continuous Ingestion of OSM Data at Facebook
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2019
Description: 
	Building forward from our work presented last year at State of the Map, we have created a system to assist mappers via machine learned models. In addition, we have built an automated ingestion framework for OSM data at scale that allows us to selectively update parts of the map instead of doing a full snapshot change.

Building forward from our work on __Mobius Logical Changesets__ (presented last year at SotM US 2018), we have created an __automated ingestion and integrity framework__ for OSM data that allows us to __selectively__ update parts of the map instead of doing a full snapshot change all at once. 

Decomposing a large set of changes in this way gives us the flexibility to __rapidly ingest__ our own additions to the map, focus on __geographical areas of importance__ to downstream products, and allows us to __quickly apply hotfixes__ whenever egregious problems do arise. 

With millions of tiny changes happening every week, we have created a system that is built on __per-feature approval and preprocessing__, that allows us to ingest changes at scale, while creating rules to __automatically process logical changesets and enforce integrity constraints (e.g. anti-vandalism, anti-profanity etc.).__ 

Due to the contextual nature of some of the changes in OpenStreetMap, the system combines Human Approval, necessary for highly visible features such as names of large administrative areas, with __Automated AI/ML-based approval__: for example, using __computer vision techniques__ to reconcile newly created features against __satellite imagery ground truth__, or applying __NLP techniques__ to determine whether other user-visible string changes are sensible and valid. These components are combined to create a __continuous ingest-validate-deploy cycle__ for OSM map data.

hello everyone.welcome for those who are

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,200
new in the room we had a very nice

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,020
session our tours June certainly you

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,560
missed it you can always watch it back

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:25,350
afterwards but we're now having our next

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,410
session and that's from Chris and from

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,150
Kevin good working with the Facebook and

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,430
they're not yet they're gonna they're

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,040
gonna show us and tell us more about an

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,930
automated ingestion framework for

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,589
OpenStreetMap data that allows us to

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,480
selectively update parts of the map so I

00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:45,030
myself I'm very curious about the data

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:52,199
file so I give them a warm applause to

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:54,989
welcome and let's give it a go all right

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,030
everybody Christopher Kevin this week on

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,339
and today we're gonna cover some of our

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,699
adventures in using osm data and

00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:04,260
Facebook so maintaining quality and a

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,290
database of millions and millions of

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,850
features is difficult and osm is a giant

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,060
database with millions and millions of

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,670
features and thousands of mappers and

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,719
ensuring data quality here kind of has

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,979
been a challenge throughout the history

00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,329
of the project at Facebook we've been

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,750
thinking about how to maintain quality

00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:26,820
and also how to improve it in part by

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,310
ensuring that only good stuff is getting

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,780
onto the map as best we can so today

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,929
we'll talk about the tooling and the AI

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:38,820
that we're using to do that ok so may or

00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:41,670
may not surprise you to learn that

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,250
Facebook has Maps there are many in

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,979
various use cases we have maps for

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,740
places like search and events and travel

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,880
there are humanitarian causes their job

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,310
listings pages you might even find it

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,539
useful to send a friend your location if

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,930
you're trying to meet up say at a

00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:01,730
conference in a foreign place

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,110
and so what we found is that

00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,650
high-quality Maps make for a better user

00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:09,020
experiences in fact we've got more than

00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:13,700
140 different use cases across the

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:16,040
entire Facebook library of apps for now

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,320
what we're doing is we're using osm as

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,840
our base map globally for all the maps

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,290
that we have but osm data is only one

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,350
part of what makes up a map on facebook

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:29,720
the teams will layer on additional data

00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,670
on top of it for the various products so

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,930
you might be visiting a Places page and

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,330
all the pin locations are actually

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,410
Facebook data and not osm data so

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,220
they're from a totally different data

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:42,530
set or you may find that you're you know

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,060
visiting seeing like a job listing and

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,459
having the location data there or

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,290
looking up restaurant recommendations

00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:52,490
from your friends and having them show

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,930
up on a map in your feed and as a user

00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,670
facing product of course we're very

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,550
interested in keeping an excellent user

00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,890
experience and to do that that means

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,990
keeping kind of like a high quality of

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,730
claw high level of quality data and the

00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,230
world's very big place and so there are

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,330
lots of things that can go wrong in lots

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,000
of places and we approach the problem in

00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:15,140
two different ways reactively and

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,400
proactively first talking reactively one

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,769
of the ways we do this is through map

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,090
reports on our product on any map

00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:22,940
surface on Facebook you'll have the

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,180
ability to report a Maps issue and a

00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,440
user can can bring that to our attention

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,959
like this town name is wrong and this

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,080
road looks incorrect or you know my

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:35,269
business isn't located here or you know

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,910
this isn't the location I searched or or

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,680
something like that and we get about 600

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,180
of these reports each day and we have a

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,220
team that goes through and looks at them

00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,959
looks at each and every one since we

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,400
started using Open Street Map on our

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,160
maps there have been over a hundred and

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,600
ninety-two thousand user reports have

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,900
been made that we've gone through each

00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,769
one and taken a look at it

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,459
generally the reports fall into these

00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,200
two buckets

00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:59,480
we've got ones that are relevant to

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,269
Facebook data to get fixed and then also

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,739
ones that get fixed in the community on

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,099
OS n that we fix with the community

00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:07,620
here's

00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,629
an example of a fix on Facebook data so

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,939
although the map is correct the base map

00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,829
has the right village name from

00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,959
OpenStreetMap what you're saying is that

00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,419
the Facebook kind of surrounding has the

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,850
wrong places information from Facebook

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,650
status ed and so in this case we talked

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,780
to the appropriate team at Facebook and

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,690
we we get that fixed so these are

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,699
reports that we got that fixed the other

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,039
case is kind of more typical and this is

00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,949
where we'd find something going on on

00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:37,620
OpenStreetMap and we try and go in and

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:40,259
fix it so today we've had more almost

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,889
400 issues have been directly fixed by

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,240
our team in OpenStreetMap directly from

00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,500
these issues that we've reported and

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,820
beyond that there will some broader

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,889
scale issues like generic names things

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,169
like name is equals yes or name equals

00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:58,080
road or name equals a building we found

00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:01,470
thousands of these all over the map and

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,470
so we set up tasks to fix these in our

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,449
partner in Indonesia hot Indonesia has

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,750
fixed more than 15,000 of these

00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:12,330
themselves using map roulette beyond

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,130
that we've also made public tasks in map

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,770
roulette public challenges where we

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:21,090
fixed we've had over 30,000 features

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:24,830
fixed there but there are there plenty

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,240
more to go so those are up and available

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:30,389
if you've been on map roulette in the

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,330
last six to eight months or so you might

00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:35,099
have seen some of these incorrect name

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,970
challenges that we've set up there are

00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:40,020
lots of these this is you know an

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,820
example of one of the ones that we've

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:46,830
got up let's see and and here's kind of

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,960
some statistics about issues that we've

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,550
fixed in that roulette there's kind of

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,860
three buckets of information that we've

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,080
got going on here for different types of

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,360
fixes and then what kind of where they

00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,330
were fixed whether it was Facebook fixed

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,250
or community six and we've found too

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,289
that you know we'll go and work on these

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,810
kind of publicly with our accounts that

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:07,150
are mapping

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,860
and fix them there and we've also found

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,690
that when the information is out there

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,180
the community will definitely engage

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,370
with with what's there and and you know

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:20,230
is interested in making fixes as well

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:23,950
and also let's see yeah so I guess

00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:25,330
can you read no probably not the like

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,160
leftmost bucket there for scale the

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,800
green bar is six thousand fixes so those

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,200
are community fixes that we've had done

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,360
zur map roulette and that's over six

00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,010
thousand so it's been quite quite a few

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,660
issues here okay so next I'd like to

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,460
talk a bit about some of the integration

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,200
that we've got with ID in terms of kind

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,169
of fixing the bad data before it gets

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,910
into the map and and so we love idea

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,680
we've been using it as our main mapping

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:55,060
tool for our AI assisted projects for

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:59,100
years and when we were doing this a

00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,990
while back one of our main gaps was

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,419
having a better validation system

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,160
so using Jotham as inspiration for this

00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:10,210
we've kind of been adding validations

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:14,110
into ID to catch common issues like a

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,910
geometry check for your resident your

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,180
road of roads crossing another road this

00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,180
roads too short there's a road that's

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,520
not connected to the road network here

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,050
you know all sorts of these and we

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,570
shared out our original version which

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,220
was on the left kind of homegrown with

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,130
Brian and Quincy and they took it and

00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,750
made it way better for for official ID

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,400
and that's the beautiful version that

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,530
we've got here on the right so that's

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,539
now in mainline ID and it's got a few

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,640
extra features like you can turn on and

00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:45,700
off you know are you searching just my

00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,440
edits or are you looking for validation

00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,660
on everything that's in the the viewable

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,150
area and ID so they've done a really

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,770
nice job with that feature and these

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:57,610
checks make it really simple really easy

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,740
to catch simple errors and and kind of

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:03,640
get that fixed up even before it enters

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:07,129
the the database okay so moving on to

00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:10,699
the tasking manager and we also work in

00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:13,569
staska manager with our internal

00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:17,029
processes and many parts of the world

00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:21,639
remain unmapped and it's especially true

00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,639
in developing countries and you know

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:29,269
mapping is is kind of a complicated task

00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:30,439
even for experienced mappers and and so

00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:31,909
many of the people in the public team

00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,569
are new and so one thing we've done is

00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:37,940
we've brought in we brought in rapid

00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:39,229
here to make it available so you can

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,060
just go into that and I'll show you in a

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,589
minute how that catches some valid some

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:48,620
some data issues and makes it really

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:50,990
good draw quality roads upfront yeah but

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:55,790
before I do that I want to also talk

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,620
about this so here's a case where you

00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,060
know it's not about just the tooling or

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,230
the AI that got there but it's also

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,490
about the ground truthing

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,889
and so we've been working with local

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,779
teams to spot whether what we're showing

00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:07,009
is kind of or what we're seeing in the

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:10,610
satellite is actually what we think it

00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:11,990
is so here's a case where you know from

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,269
the satellite imagery we've got two

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,670
bridges they look like bridges you know

00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:17,959
we wouldn't know quite how to mark them

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,089
up properly but when you actually get on

00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,589
the ground they're very different what

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,029
you see there you know one's suitable

00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:26,240
for walking across and the other one is

00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,470
you can drive a car over so it's you

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,959
know kind of local knowledge you can

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:33,560
only get on the ground and we found that

00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,699
the the AI that we have does help here

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,069
like if we can spend less time

00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:39,680
digitizing and doing that it kind of

00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:42,769
opens up more of the you know the time

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,310
just to be able to get out on the ground

00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:47,720
and and and do some ground tracing and

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,250
also we provide this information back to

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,149
the community so that if you're looking

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,529
if you're within the community and

00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,480
looking at satellite imagery you know it

00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:56,600
might provide you some extra perspective

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,279
on how this is you know how you might be

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,430
thinking about these things from this

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,430
guy

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:09,440
all right so over the past year and a

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:13,220
half with AI plus the local mapping team

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,440
we've completed more than 99% of the

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,870
roads in Indonesia and so here's a short

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:25,850
animation it's kind of shows day by day

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:27,410
how our mapping is gone there and yeah

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:31,370
so you can see the distance is ticking

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,140
up and the features ticking up so yeah

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,660
about eighteen months work from last May

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,420
up until just a few weeks ago is what's

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,930
present in this visualization one in

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,930
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,090
yes over four four hundred and fifty

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:59,040
thousand kilometers mapped and it's

00:10:54,090 --> 00:11:06,990
actually over a million features that

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:08,940
we've not done going in there okay so

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,430
it's a lot there's a lot to do there's a

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,400
lot of work there's a limited time and

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,320
everyone is their own resources are

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,730
limited and so this is why we kind of

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,310
started to look at ways in which we can

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,750
speed up the process to improve the data

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,730
coverage and also to fill in the missing

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,620
gaps with AI so I'm going to talk now

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,090
about what we call our map with AI

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:34,980
efforts where we get into our work there

00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:36,600
and starting about 15 years ago that

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,540
when satellite images kind of came

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,920
online and began to be used for mapping

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,460
there was kind of a wide debate about

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,410
privacy precision and how we ought to

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,180
use these things but today it's very

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,980
different you know now we're using these

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,300
regularly they have no limitations you

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,400
know lineman is one of these notable

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,350
limitations but we kind of know how to

00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,270
work with it it's a known quantity it

00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,490
feels like computer assisted mapping is

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:01,500
going through the same kind of debate

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,670
stage right now that we were with it we

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,770
were seeing back then with satellite

00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,660
imagery today we're kind of talking

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,210
about what are kind of the mundane and

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,580
repetitive tasks that could be done by a

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:14,790
machine to improve the quality of the

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,800
map and to simplify the process of

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,480
course for more complicated tasks and

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,640
kind of in general for for bringing

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,650
knowledge into the mapping or doing

00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,970
you know the kind of the human attention

00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:27,180
and judgment is always something that's

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,650
required so kind of the most obvious

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,050
thing we can do with computers is we

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:34,230
have verification and validation and I

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,270
showed some of those earlier and then

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,770
where we're getting to now is you know

00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,150
given the satellite imagery can we kind

00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,980
of have the computer come up with the

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,310
roads there on it or the buildings that

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,690
are on it and propose those as edits in

00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,760
the future you know there might be

00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,610
things that affect navigation and

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,070
routing

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:54,050
no no and when it comes to suggesting

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,330
feature you know suggesting the features

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:59,090
I'm gonna show soon how we're thinking

00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:02,720
about doing the roads and and and the

00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:06,700
buildings and then kind of further

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,830
future and there's potential here with

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,030
the auto like we do auto alignment even

00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,980
for the satellite imagery where that's

00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,450
still an outstanding problem and what

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:20,230
some kinds of data sources can we work

00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:22,130
with in conflating these okay right so

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,660
we've been experimenting with computer

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,940
system mapping for years we've had

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,270
various degrees of success we've gotten

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:31,400
a lot of feedback from the community and

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,230
here's what we've done to speed up the

00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,480
road map you want to play this for you

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,740
we think after working on it with some

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,180
design iteration here and there we've

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,730
kind of come up with a really great way

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,420
to kind of merge computer assisted

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,200
mapping and

00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,280
the TAS who might do as a person just

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,660
let me bring this down so this is kind

00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,880
of a normal workflow coming in from the

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:54,370
tasking manager you know select a task

00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:58,610
we were jumping into rapid or editor and

00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:02,380
zooming in kind of what you might do to

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,380
draw a line by hand

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,170
all right and you might have to assign

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:14,069
road type or kind of get that going and

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:16,589
and so now we're going to show what

00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:18,779
we're doing in rapid this is what we've

00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,009
developed based on computer the machine

00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,170
learned roads they're kind of proposed

00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:24,180
as edits the geometry that's drawn the

00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,040
digitisation is already already pretty

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,290
good you can kind of go in there select

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,649
them choose to add them to the map or

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,810
not you'll see that rows are selected

00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:35,220
might automatically connect with ways

00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,589
that are already present OSM their

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,029
conflict conflated and then here we're

00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:41,149
showing some of that validation earlier

00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:44,519
how its built-in so you add the roads

00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:47,189
validate them and and it's kind of a

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,079
quicker workflow for working through

00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:54,449
this and so this is what we released in

00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:56,490
July this is our rapid editor and it's

00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:58,860
it's the basis of this so we think with

00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,439
this you've got the right balance here

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,790
between what the machine can do and what

00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:09,120
decisions that you might make as the

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:11,370
editor okay so to get to the to kind of

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,410
show what it's doing so to get to the

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,029
bottom of it all it's um there's kind of

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,620
a big computer vision model a neural

00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:19,529
network that detects roads from

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,699
high-resolution satellite imagery so

00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,079
these are the roads that we've detected

00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,670
kind of raw pixel data from the

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,040
satellite imagery it's a challenging

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,509
task and terrain can be different

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,490
throughout the world so we have a single

00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:32,000
global model that works across

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,000
everywhere

00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:41,120
okay I'm gonna skip over for a moment so

00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:41,120
let me just pop out in here

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,020
[Music]

00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:02,890
was not on time but we are actually

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:04,510
perfectly on time okay so right we have

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,180
a single single global model that we're

00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,980
using across different terrains

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,240
this here's Ethiopia in many cases the

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,580
models advanced stuff that it can kind

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,690
of work correctly all over but you can

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,700
see there's still some things that don't

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,290
quite work out so in the bottom right

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,030
there's a dry riverbed that gets picked

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,590
up as a false positive and that's that's

00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,090
a place where you know it's still up to

00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,130
you whether you're going to accept or

00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:35,200
reject the changes that have been

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:37,030
proposed alright and here's a Nigeria

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,940
it's another interesting case and and it

00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,290
has a lot of tree cover and you see the

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:51,220
model is still quite good at picking out

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:53,350
the roads okay and lastly is Bastas this

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,330
is my home city and it turns out that we

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,330
detect all these streets in Boston which

00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:01,150
is great but it turns out Boston's

00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,400
already very well mapped so having all

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,290
these might be kind of a lot of noisy

00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,890
data and so what we do next is the last

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:11,110
stage of this process and and what we do

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,580
is we're doing conflation those are a

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,230
bit thin but you can see there's the

00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,520
magenta layer over here that's all the

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,800
roads that we've detected that are not

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,810
yet in OSM so on the right hand side is

00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,340
the awesome databases this is on the

00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,290
left hand side sorry and on the right

00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:26,980
hand side is after we've done conflation

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,570
with what's there we brought in and

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,610
that's that's basically how rapid works

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:32,470
is present you know doing that

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,000
taking the the raw predictions turning

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,640
them into a form that are usable and

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,930
worth bringing in potentially and then

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,730
presenting them to you as an editor

00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,270
where you can use that as a basis for

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,450
for your work from that point forward

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,630
okay

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,730
and so there we got a rate so we really

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,900
says in July we got some feedback to the

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,330
big pieces of feedback one of those

00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,190
countries so we've been adding a lot of

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,860
countries today we just added Zambia and

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,200
Democratic Republic of the Congo so

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,669
those are available there are many other

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,409
countries there as well

00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:04,909
we've also had a request for a lot of

00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:06,469
other datasets so this isn't just a

00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:08,659
machine learning workflow it's really a

00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:09,739
data set workflow where the machine

00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:12,679
learn data is just one of those

00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:14,389
available ones and so if you think data

00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,309
sets not yet no Sam and you think you

00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:18,739
know kind of conflating out with

00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:20,509
somewhere and you think of hey buildings

00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:22,219
might be a nice place to go forward with

00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:24,169
this you might think of the Microsoft

00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:25,999
data set and they announced yesterday

00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,349
also that they've expanded the u.s.

00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:30,799
building footprint there's now in

00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:34,429
Tanzania and Uganda Uganda available

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,139
another 18 million buildings there and

00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:37,459
so what we'd like to do is show you kind

00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:44,809
of an experimental feature that we put

00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:47,209
together using buildings here so this is

00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:49,489
the standard the standard roads workflow

00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:51,829
just gonna go over here kind of

00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:53,509
highlighting those and then here we're

00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:58,009
getting into what we've got is this new

00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:59,419
buildings workflow and this is a you can

00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:02,539
see it kind of behaves the same way you

00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:03,649
select what makes sense reject what

00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:09,440
doesn't make sense and you can move

00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:11,779
along all right yeah so so what can you

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,279
today use it you know go check it out

00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,079
see if you know this is something you're

00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,029
interested in there's map with dot AI

00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:18,709
it's a website you can go check down you

00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:20,149
can learn more about this technology and

00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:22,159
jump into rapid and do some editing

00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:23,479
there's a very special link up here for

00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:26,299
the experimental buildings feature

00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:32,659
that's some map without a I slash rapid

00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:33,709
- SOT M 2019 try that too - um to see if

00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:37,669
buildings you know it's available in the

00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:39,320
US Tanzania and Uganda and also today at

00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:41,089
3 o'clock the 4 o'clock we'll be talking

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,979
in mathematic on B is that versus the

00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:45,379
feather session which is in the green

00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:47,809
square on the back page of your your

00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:49,759
program if you need to find it's a

00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:51,619
different building and lastly you can

00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,859
reach us a map with AI feedback on the

00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:56,239
slack Channel and so that's the the map

00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:58,940
with AI portion I'm gonna hand it over

00:19:56,239 --> 00:20:09,710
to Kevin now to talk about

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:11,759
ingestion of us I'm good hello okay

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,870
alright I don't have a ton of time so

00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,460
I'll try to get through this material

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,950
fairly quickly

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,809
so what Chris was talking about was kind

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,000
of the upstream of OS M getting data

00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:22,320
into OS M using these various models

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,570
what I'm gonna talk about is how

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,149
Facebook deals with OS m data down

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:33,480
streams how we ingest it and kind of

00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:35,429
clean it up so so restating our vision

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,440
our vision is to continuously ingest an

00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:43,200
integrate upstream OS m while keeping

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:44,820
the map fresh and correct okay so kind

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,409
of restating what we talked about last

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,509
year at the state of the map us we

00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:50,210
started this project Mobius we called it

00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:52,710
Mobius because OS M has never finished

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,870
and the main outcome of this project has

00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,669
been this graph theoretic construction

00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:00,360
that we call logical change sets or

00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:03,149
loaches and we use this to demonstrate

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,399
that we could ingest just the tile and

00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:07,620
roads that our mapping team had created

00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:09,210
without having to deal with ingesting

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,120
all the rest of OS m think about

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,370
thinking about how to clean up that data

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,500
so this is a real challenge because OS m

00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:19,019
is massive there are twenty to thirty

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,480
thousand change sets every day with

00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:23,490
three million daily changes so there's a

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,539
ton of data how do we process this at a

00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:28,529
regular cadence while maintaining

00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:31,049
freshness and correctness so basically

00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:34,259
the logical change sets are we take our

00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:36,480
version of OS m and we take a recent

00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:38,279
snapshot of OS m that's that's the

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,299
latest and we just take a dip of those

00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:41,070
two things right so we're not

00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,889
continuously ingesting wewe take a

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,720
snapshot every few weeks we take the

00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:47,340
diff this gives us a flat list of all

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,110
the changes of all the features that

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,539
have changed and in you know since we've

00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,950
last updated and then we re cluster

00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,019
those into a different set of change

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,879
sets that's kind of orthogonal to the

00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:59,070
usual notion of an OS m change set and

00:21:56,879 --> 00:22:01,289
the point is to maintain geometric

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,389
integrity so if in a single change set

00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:04,830
someone changed a road over in Thailand

00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:06,659
and someone change the road in Germany

00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,460
in the same change set those should

00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,379
belong in different logical change sets

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,490
but then at the same time if someone

00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:13,050
creates a road and then laid

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,950
a different person modifies that road

00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:19,710
that's kind of the same change set so we

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,870
break them up into these clusters and

00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,040
then we reviewed them right so and then

00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,540
the nice thing about these clusters is

00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,980
that you can sort of reject an arbitrary

00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,460
number of them accept an arbitrary

00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:32,790
number of them and when you apply just

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,440
that subset you still get kind of a map

00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,360
that has geometric integrity right you

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,980
don't have dangling references you don't

00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,100
have roads that just sort of cut off at

00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:45,420
a tile or something that is in a

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,520
nutshell how the Loach's work okay so I

00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,309
have to skip a few slides talking about

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,900
the manual review the the crux of this

00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:53,460
is that we need to maximize the number

00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,170
of automatic decisions that we make

00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,550
because human reviewers it would take

00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,840
just hundreds of human reviewers to

00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,240
actually get through all these logical

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:05,040
change sets so we introduced machine

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,480
augmented review and the basic crux here

00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,980
is that you sort of won some of the

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,110
machine augmented review to figure out

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,429
if a change set is good or if a change

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:16,200
that is bad and those are kind of

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:17,460
separate procedures and let me just talk

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,260
a little bit about some of the rules

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,960
that we use to actually decide whether a

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,420
change set is good or bad so first we

00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,580
score things per feature and then if a

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,559
given cluster has all approved features

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,300
we approve that cluster if the cluster

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,280
has a rejected feature then we reject

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,700
that cluster otherwise we have to

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,530
manually review it and so some of the

00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,120
cool techniques we use are we use

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,460
algorithmic curve similarity so for

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,350
example if someone draws a road around a

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,790
curve and then someone else comes in and

00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,860
kind of modifies it to really make it a

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:52,290
little more precise then then we can

00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,790
automatically accept that we use the a I

00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:55,020
assisted validation so some of the

00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,429
automatic road detection stuff that

00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,850
Chris was talking about we can use to

00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:02,600
validate other roads and we look at tag

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,860
change significance to determine whether

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,330
attack change is significant so changing

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,710
something from grass to grassland is

00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:11,130
maybe not that significant but changing

00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:12,900
it to a lake is significant and finally

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,550
we use the age of the edit so if someone

00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,970
edited something it hasn't been touched

00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:19,320
in six months that leads us to tend to

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,550
believe that actually that change is

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,680
probably okay if it hasn't been

00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:27,240
verted and finally use a reputation the

00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,420
takeaway here is that we were able to

00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,210
approve three million features in 2018

00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,670
we've 25x that since then and our goal

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,260
is to get all 1.8 million features that

00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:41,430
are between us and the latest version of

00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,750
OS m and the mission is finally to catch

00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,580
up and stay caught up at a regular

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:54,900
cadence alright I think I'm out of time

00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:56,400
so I guess that's it thanks Ari to cut

00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,840
you a little bit but I also want to give

00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,610
the space to the room to ask a few

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,620
questions because I think there are many

00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,540
questions see already several hands

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:09,780
let's take two questions at the same

00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:11,280
time so whether we use a face book or

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,840
not I think we can probably all agree

00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,640
that they're in a really powerful

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,900
position to tell its users that actually

00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,280
the reason your maps are high-quality

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:25,320
and up-to-date or you know it's

00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,470
up-to-date as they are is because of

00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,270
OpenStreetMap so my question is going to

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,910
be a bit two part one is because there's

00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:36,770
gonna be lots of people that want to ask

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:39,410
you about attribution and calling it

00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:42,180
OpenStreetMap not Facebook Maps at times

00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:45,270
but also I just think is there anything

00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:48,420
you're doing to kind of help that

00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:51,090
perception of help tell your users why

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:57,870
your Maps are good on a kind of beyond

00:25:51,090 --> 00:26:02,450
just education can we take a second

00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:06,870
question just now so we can just answer

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:08,850
hello you show how quickly is to map all

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,190
these areas in Indonesia and some other

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:13,110
countries and but we have two realities

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,470
the one from above and around the ground

00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:19,740
so how much percentage of all those

00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:23,070
roads maps through rapid ID are getting

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,970
check if they are correct or not and if

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,670
they are not correct

00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,440
are you also feeding the models to be

00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,850
able to correct that in

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:36,210
now there are cities and other places

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:38,520
but it's a fun question from Miriam

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,320
about the models and checking the data

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:46,230
and one question about Gregory about

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:53,070
contribution and yeah more OpenStreetMap

00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:54,690
as finding a place on Facebook so for

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,180
attribution that we do have our

00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,490
attribution to OpenStreetMap and we're

00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,610
currently working to kind of unify the

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:04,110
Maps experience you know we have many

00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:07,110
different services on many different

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:09,570
operating systems but attribution is a

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:12,570
very important topic to us so we are

00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:18,750
working to unify that help people see

00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:20,370
that right for them this is the mapping

00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,530
so how many things on rap that are

00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:24,690
actually validated on as ground truth as

00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,620
well do we have numbers around percent

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,160
so I don't have numbers around

00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,570
percentages of the rows there there now

00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,740
find me after and we could I could

00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,300
connect with the right people who would

00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,520
know more about exactly what we've got

00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,610
there the work that we did in Indonesia

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,590
that I showed we're working with hot in

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:44,010
Indonesia and there's a local team there

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,630
so we it tends to Rosetta get validated

00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,950
where there's more uncertainty rather

00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,200
than less uncertainty coming from the

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,640
satellite mapping but um yeah let's I

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,800
can follow up with you more with that if

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:58,560
you like let's take one more question

00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:00,570
hi thank you for presentation and I have

00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,760
a question regarding these models you

00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:06,150
said you you are using single model for

00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,890
for the whole world for all areas so the

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:11,700
question is why you decided to go with

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:13,860
the with a single model and you do some

00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,200
some sort of pre-processing of those

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,110
images so that you can somehow unify

00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,369
them on

00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:25,210
on like on machine level and something

00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:26,739
later first of the first parts what why

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,559
are we using a global model rather than

00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:32,499
I guess multiple regional models and I

00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:35,080
miss the second question was the the

00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:37,389
second question like to do some sort of

00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,399
pre-processing of those images like I

00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:42,580
don't know any any type of filtering

00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:44,529
like I mean you can make them black and

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,840
white and or something like that I mean

00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:49,629
this would be a stupid I guess but I

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,090
mean any type of sure yeah there's a

00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:53,889
good blog post on this so on a single

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,970
model makes sense because it's working

00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:56,320
and then we can train a single model

00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:00,669
that works the world we kind of improve

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,940
everywhere as we go using multiple

00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:06,009
models or it was just single shot shot

00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,919
working from the beginning and that's it

00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:09,940
oh my god yeah we should follow up on

00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,249
this I'll connect you with the people

00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,359
who are you know working on the specific

00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:16,539
models themselves there's also a great

00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,859
blog post on Facebook say I blog that

00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:19,600
goes into some of the detail about

00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:24,549
exactly what the models doing that was

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:28,289
published back in July thank you thanks

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:30,580
a lot this was it they are still around

00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:32,649
so ask your questions I think there are

00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,200
many more questions and also I think

00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:38,940
there's more to tell from your side too

00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,940
so thanks a lot give them in the balls

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,570
