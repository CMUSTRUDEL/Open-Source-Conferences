Title: 2019: Introduce OpenPlaceReviews and connect to OpenStreetMap
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2019
Description: 
	As of today we have OpenStreetMap but it doesn't fit all data and some data is not recommended for submission. We've got user reviews request in OsmAnd and Maps.Me and we would like to collaborate with OpenStreetMap community to create independent open platform for reviews.

I would like to talk about how data could be stored and moderated and would like to explain how that data will be further integrated with OpenStreetMap and will be contributed back to OSM! 

One of the main contribution to OSM database itself will be justified places and details of places itself. I will explain how tools will validate License sanity and avoid Import problem to OSM i.e. how every edit will be administered by OSM-user. In the end we would like to have seamless OSM user experience integration and create open OSM-satellite project.

*OpenPlaceReviews - A new way for local reviews*
Open. Collaborative. Trustworthy.

Openness - make all the reviews data open, so every project can access and contribute back.
Community driven - build a community to make decision about moderation, data structure together.
Decentralization - develop a decentralized system from the Day 1 to avoid scalability issues in the future.
Trust - create tools to detect fraud, spam & keep all the data open to prevent any data manipulation.
Monetization - make business subscriptions once the project is matured and spread the income between applications, authors, moderators and network operators.

welcome to the next talk here at Sutton

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,050
2019 we

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,210
we'll talk about open place reviews now

00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:23,369
and how to connect data to OpenStreetMap

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:27,300
yes thank you hello everybody

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:29,669
I'm Victor sharp I'm mostly known as a

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,910
founder of Osment mobile maps and

00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:34,920
navigation and today and we'll talk

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,500
about completely different topic about a

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:43,500
new project that we are trying to start

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,110
which results could be used in osmond

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,530
but it is mostly targeted to fix as a

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,010
mission blocks in OpenStreetMap and to

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,180
cover and to create a place directory

00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:58,260
which we see in products like

00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:01,040
TripAdvisor or Google Maps let me first

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,170
of all start by congratulating all of us

00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,210
that we reach so many people that

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,610
OpenStreetMap reach so many people in

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,360
the world so it is even hard to count

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,979
how many people use in OpenStreetMap

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,670
directly or indirectly there are

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:21,030
probably 30 to 40 large applications

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:25,049
that have more than 1 million user base

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,869
and osmond is one of them I really hope

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,439
that audience of OpenStreetMap will

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,170
continue to grow and be basically the

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,409
biggest Maps audience of Google Maps of

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:43,319
1 billion one day and of course exceeded

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:45,960
by far but so far we need to overcome

00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,689
many difficulties we have with Open

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,539
Street Map we till this and I think we

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:55,380
deserve more open world in a 21st

00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:56,969
century let's take a look first of all

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,829
what I mean by vision Blox

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:04,079
we all know that not all data can feed

00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:06,869
OpenStreetMap of course we could say

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,880
that is not a business of Open Street

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,630
Map to deal with the data like places

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,800
photo assert a.m. data public transport

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:19,709
shadow place reviews 3d buildings and as

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,870
a microphone mapping staff it is a very

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:25,530
long list what is related to Open Street

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,610
Map but is not but it doesn't belongs to

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,300
it yet

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,970
or anyway people expectation is quite

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,610
high and they expect full service of

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,120
applications they use and great

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,890
experience so all features need to be

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,360
interconnected with each other for

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,970
example today we will have a different

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,550
talk about public transport which we did

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,010
on based on OpenStreetMap data and where

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,870
we deal with the problems that transport

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,090
is not much useful when we don't have a

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,610
transfer shadow and transfer Shadle

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,640
doesn't belong to OpenStreetMap and and

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,980
we need to build a connection where what

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,150
services provide and it needs to be open

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:10,770
enough so every every project can use it

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:12,660
and but there is nothing wrong that

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,590
OpenStreetMap doesn't accept all the

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:19,470
data clearly because that data cannot

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,380
doesn't fit well into main dataset just

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,600
let's take a look for example that

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,000
datasets which were which are primary

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,670
and still exists like GPX tracks were

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,739
very important in the beginning of the

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,260
project but not anymore because now

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:38,160
we're using more satellite imagery and

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,130
so on and API is quite limited we don't

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,989
even have full damps of GPX tracks

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:49,970
anymore since 2014 so obviously we can't

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:53,100
expect that reviews could feed

00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,900
OpenStreetMap data set not only because

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,459
it doesn't fit it's because resources

00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,709
that maintain OpenStreetMap rep is

00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:06,900
limited and we need to do a lot we need

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:10,890
to build many satellites projects to fix

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,410
the gap well meanwhile I think why we

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:18,479
cannot fix a gap is a problem of

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:20,970
Technology so obviously we need to have

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,910
a technology that can fit or it can

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,460
store more data than OpenStreetMap but

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,800
it also need to be interconnected to

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,720
store connections like relation energy

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,810
with third party edges between

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,539
OpenStreetMap and third my third party

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,000
data so on this slide you can see what I

00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:41,190
listed as expectation from technology to

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,200
be used for this mission

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,270
first of all and the data should be open

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,050
so everybody who has access and can use

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:52,930
OpenStreetMap data can use this data as

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,720
well it should be community driven there

00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,480
is no kind of sense today in a permanent

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,960
static data set because the world is

00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,810
changing especially in the map related

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,630
things and it needs to be driven by a

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,430
community similar to how Open Street Map

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,250
is driven it should be decentralized

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:16,060
that's what we are missing a little bit

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:19,360
from osm a main source because we have

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,030
put in quite a high load on the main

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,700
servers which results they become really

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,870
critical and doesn't give enough

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,120
flexibility to provide a different

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,120
version of API different version of

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,520
something so it's better when it will be

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,530
decentralized so it will be less load

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,110
and it's easier to maintain and of

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,810
course it should support to store big

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:45,310
data at least one terabyte of data I

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:50,070
would say it's a big data that's what we

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:52,720
need at least of course that's quite

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,570
many limitation for that technology and

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,419
maybe that's why it doesn't exist so we

00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,870
can easily take it and reuse it but I

00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:04,000
believe if we start a project we do a

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,010
mistake so the successor of course will

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,780
think that mistake and eventually we

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:12,130
will get the technology that will fit

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,520
really well to us even though in the

00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,229
beginning we were focused mostly on

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,870
development a product for storing

00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:22,360
reviews we understand that many things

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,700
we need to do is quite generic so we

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,550
separate projects in two parts one of

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,460
them is a database where we store stuff

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:34,840
and the Dylan is API and another thing

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,880
is basically reviews related stuff from

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,940
the day one I was looking for that for

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,830
technologies that can really fit well to

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,910
be open decentralized community driven

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:49,150
and be able to store big data and and

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:51,580
there was no not such technology that

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,490
solves everything even though I am a big

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,270
fan of blockchain project of

00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:01,229
pure idea of how that works if we remove

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:03,539
financial part of it for example it

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:05,130
satisfies many of the criterias it could

00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:08,250
be open there are some really

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:10,400
community-driven block chains it's by

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,840
default decentralized it provides API

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,150
but it is extremely expensive for

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,460
example storing one megabyte in a public

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,039
blockchain like a Bitcoin store costs

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,340
you ten thousand dollars and in some

00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:26,190
other about $1,000 suits something is

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:30,090
broken there and well we will talk about

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:33,330
it later what's broken so and we don't

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:36,090
have enough so here you see pluses and

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,880
minuses of it and it's great to combine

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:41,190
both walls and benefit from both bars so

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,289
from database we can have a optimized

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,449
data access we have many tools how we

00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:47,970
can build a website because it's hard to

00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,740
build a website just on the role API you

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,530
prefer to have with some mappings and

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,639
strong and this database it sells easier

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,039
because you have a centralized

00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,380
maintenance so that's what we had we

00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,210
were trying to achieve but of course we

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,940
need to make compromises otherwise it's

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,719
it's just great walls so one of them is

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:09,000
to be of course don't want to have a

00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:11,400
miners because they produce at extreme

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,320
cost of storage and that means that we

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,150
cannot rely on a proof of work but we

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,969
still can rely of proof of stake or

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,740
proof of authority which will rely a lot

00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:22,199
and for example in OpenStreetMap world

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,330
when because we trust what comes from my

00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,550
main servers and so on and we know how

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,039
to deal if something is broken

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,169
also we don't have a built-in spam

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,419
protection in with the public blockchain

00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:35,130
spam protection is just the cost you

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,899
need to pay for what you put in

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,589
blockchain nobody cares basically what

00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:42,990
you put and we don't have that but in

00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:45,870
projects like Wikipedia in OpenStreetMap

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,970
we we kind of develop in the culture

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,579
what it means to maintain to reverse

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,970
stuff and to deal with the spam and to

00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:56,790
detect quite a few some presentation

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,579
this sort my about vandalism and how we

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,740
deal with it and how we check it

00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:04,860
actually if you look at in a nutshell

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,170
OpenStreetMap has lots of benefits with

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,240
OpenStreetMap has a lot of similarities

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,269
with the blockchain so if we compare

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,760
just changesets with blocks

00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:16,470
well basically sorry mini gives as a

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,959
blocks and change this will be a

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,720
transactions so you can see that blocks

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,630
come every minute there is a practical

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,230
size limitation how big minute if could

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:31,230
be and it's of course it's purely

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,959
centralized blockchain because it's

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,640
controlled by one entity but there is of

00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:38,640
course the centralization of how many

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,350
tools how many editors can deal this

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,839
OpenStreetMap but of course it's very

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,529
specific blockchain

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:49,800
so that's a technology that I see who

00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:52,769
could work the fill the gaps even though

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,200
we will be spent like six months seven

00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:57,800
months to build the technology and we

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,100
are not there yet so expect and we still

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,990
have quite a lot of quite a big backlog

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,930
but I think in the to three months it

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,020
will be ready for first releases or for

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,610
place reviews so let's see how what it

00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,920
means actually plays directories and

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,420
reviews this is a typical screen shows

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,079
how it could looks like they're taken

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:21,420
from Google Maps you see menus you see

00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:24,690
photos you see a review segregated data

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,520
and there is subjective and objective

00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,040
information obviously objective

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,440
information we can put an input street

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,550
map and it's already there sometimes but

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,610
is it is not verified regularly not

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,250
checked so that's a little bit of an

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,560
issue there I think when we see the

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,890
screens we actually think okay these are

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,750
important screens and if we manage to do

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,990
something similar in OpenStreetMap it

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:55,440
will help to convert more people that

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:58,110
that use everyday map application into

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,990
Open Street Map and basically expand our

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:03,630
community so let's take a look wick look

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,380
at the market of this application so we

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:10,320
have Google Maps TripAdvisor Yelp and

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:12,360
obviously there is no as we see Google

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,360
dominates on that market much more even

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,020
than between map application because

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,790
there's a

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:22,850
OpenStreetMap which competes with it and

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:26,750
here there is no open alternative even

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,370
by a scale of 0.1% comparing to Google

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,310
Maps and if you think that data

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,260
duplicates quite fast every to each

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,790
three years it needs to change in

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,550
reviews because it doesn't make sense

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,680
anymore so it's easy to extrapolate that

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:43,880
Google domination belong the exede and

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,070
in five years it will be just enormous

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,400
because only Google among these

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:52,280
applications provides map good map and

00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,090
which means that it converts more and

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,680
more people and gets more and more data

00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:00,380
here I'm not representing only myself

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,000
but Elsa maps me because we had a shared

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,930
agreement that we need to work on our

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,480
open data set to store reviews and we

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,610
hope that in a year we could reach one

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,470
or ten between one and ten percent of

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:17,030
the market by just sharing the reviews

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:21,290
Maps me already has rabies but they are

00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:23,090
not open yet let's have a quick look how

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,240
it could work so we can see the main

00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:30,280
actors on the screen like geo apps is

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,590
one part of the system open street map

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,150
as a separate one and we have a business

00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,400
owners and their websites where they

00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:40,580
maintain the data about themselves and

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,590
and in the center we see open place

00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,980
reviews data set which is of course

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:50,660
guarded by a community like Open Street

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:53,570
Map so let's take a look a little bit

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,550
deeper and let's see how benefit from

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,770
each other Gio apps and community and

00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,020
open place reviews projects so it's

00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,430
pretty pretty in principle it's very

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,660
similar how it works to david's

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:08,030
OpenStreetMap because awesome and masked

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,180
me can contribute individual edits from

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:13,520
users for example about places but on

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:17,300
the second they get aggregated data back

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,490
in up here it could be aggregated

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,250
reviews that they can download and

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:26,330
people can use it offline photos about

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:28,790
the places and so on and in the back

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,160
what's important to say as well that

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:36,740
our target to make it compatible with OS

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:38,990
M format so every application can easily

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,720
integrate it in their stream in their

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:46,790
data flow because it's already to us

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,860
with OpenStreetMap data if we take a

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,630
look how it could be in how it could be

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,390
beneficial with OpenStreetMap

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,270
integration we could see that initial

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,680
input of course is done from

00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,810
OpenStreetMap where we take place and

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,240
text locations but what we can

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:04,940
contribute back is to verify the

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,400
presence of a place if it has exactly

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,440
the same name or not we have already a

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,920
street complete tools other tools to

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,990
help but of course another tool if it

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,710
works if it focuses on one thing can

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:22,160
only make it better and what we are

00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:24,530
targeting to push import like verified

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,570
present if it's still exists or not and

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,850
some details like opening hours and

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,950
cuisine of course what we need to make

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,460
sure that license is compatible with the

00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:37,970
OpenStreetMap and that import is

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:41,410
semi-automated and the license we choose

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:45,350
and for both contribution terms and

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:47,240
database export to be she zero because

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:51,170
it's very close to public domain and

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,400
it's for sure compatible with Open

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,050
Street Map but of course it's a

00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,550
beginning of the process we need to give

00:14:54,050 --> 00:15:00,650
a proper waiver right wikipage how it

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,240
could be done and we don't want of

00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,310
course to be it automatic it will be

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,200
always semi-automatic but there are

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,090
simple techniques we can follow it for

00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,910
example place was not updated to an Open

00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,070
Street Map and user case for example

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,840
even account on Open Street Map and just

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,880
using that tool to verify of place

00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:20,090
exists of course we can contribute it

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,910
back to Open Street Map but we need to

00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,710
be careful and take that step by step of

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,690
course and the first step would be to

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,840
collect the data and second to start

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:34,100
looking into details to negotiate how

00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:36,110
that process could work of importing the

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,590
third one link is quite interesting

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,680
because it's it doesn't work with Open

00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:43,650
Street Map is

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,900
collecting data with third party it's

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,029
very simple similar to import but there

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,820
is a main difference so you in

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:53,640
OpenStreetMap import works once once it

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:56,220
ends up in OpenStreetMap which actually

00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,610
slows down many inputs especially when

00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,010
we don't know the license and and

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,950
sometimes it's just Russians importantly

00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:08,010
a pollutant the main dataset what we see

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,839
is that we can collect data but not use

00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,510
it for what we can collect and group it

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,460
by sources unless we get a clear

00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:17,430
understanding a key that it is fine to

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,980
import but there is no need to kind of

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,570
merge it immediately we can still keep

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,540
it as a source and for example

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,970
communities can define what source is

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,160
most reliable for example is a source

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,230
from a website of the business owner and

00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,210
we have a permission for example to use

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,770
it and even if we don't have a

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:38,160
permission to import it to open source

00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:39,900
map still many geo apps can follow for

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,940
example guidelines to put proper

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,220
attribution and display that data which

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,440
is a great benefit as well because

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,030
end-users will will see that data that

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,339
will not be lost even though it has a

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,770
special attribution that that is not

00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:55,440
compatible with OpenStreetMap license so

00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,150
what we think is - to at least collect

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,730
information from websites using

00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:02,280
crowler's and do similar job as a web

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,620
search engine do just to present a case

00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,740
the link and where's the ticket is taken

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:13,260
from for example the r18 and the name so

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:16,620
this is what actually search engines do

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,350
but of course we the source should stay

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,839
very clear and it shouldn't mix mix up

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:28,020
things what people see what was taken

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:31,920
automatically and so on Oh a few words

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,420
about the current status and the main

00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,870
thing I want to mention that there is no

00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:40,890
public release yet and you probably can

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:45,240
follow the news on our forum or website

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:47,850
once it happens we started back in

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,150
February by developed and the core of

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:53,910
the blockchain called open DB in the

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:56,310
June we already did the initial awesome

00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:59,280
part of all of about two million places

00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,490
and now it's getting in sync so the

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,260
import took about four hours and now

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,020
it's a synchronized every half an hour

00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,810
so it's a maintained and it's stored in

00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,360
blockchain so it's kind of optimized it

00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,520
was tricky to get it done and the last

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,460
months we started to working on the

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,010
mobile clients to display the data it's

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,690
nothing special but it's using that

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,970
blockchain already to display the data

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,210
it's not using techniques like Osmond

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,520
does so it's pretty interesting and of

00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,890
course because technology be used as a

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,010
blockchain it's immediately provides API

00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:37,230
to edit a me to read information to

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,570
download we're working to extend that

00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,600
API and right now

00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:45,030
the mobile client is in progress and we

00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,800
are working to start uploading data to

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:50,210
blockchain for examples to be simple

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:53,190
photos about places and the simple

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,860
information if please present or not and

00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,360
in the future we really ends at the

00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,850
moment we are going to make a public

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,130
race now meanwhile we are working on

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,710
blockchain Explorer it is ready but we

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:08,040
more we want to make it more kind of

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,290
usable and the main thing of course we

00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,660
are trying to gather a community gather

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,670
opinions for people think about it

00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,250
whether they want to contribute in what

00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,560
way and so on in futures there are lots

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:23,760
of tasks to be done to create a rich

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:26,880
website functionality that that people

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,570
can work to administers data to have a

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,190
web crawlers configuration and to to do

00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,430
something similar that Open Street Map

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:39,420
has with proposals and defining a tacit

00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:45,030
schema so this this is kind of the road

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:49,080
map II we hope to be done in 2020 so the

00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:51,300
last but not least I would like to have

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,700
I would like to say that some big

00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,190
projects and contributions of course of

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,280
welcome you can find us on telegram

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:02,490
channel or on our forum the links will

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,710
be present on the last slide but here

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,690
you can see three main tracks we we

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,620
welcome contribution developers of

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,660
course

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,700
of Java language can contribute to the

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,030
blockchain itself or defining new

00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,890
crowler's or alternative clients and

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:19,140
boats the interesting thing that

00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,180
administrators could help us to detect

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,950
errors mistakes between in

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,670
synchronization with OpenStreetMap and

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:28,920
or and the text strange activity also

00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:31,410
they could raise a red flag if the data

00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,690
becomes inconsistent basically every

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,120
active user that does a little bit

00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,309
investigation is an administrator and

00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,320
that's what we want to have it very

00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:43,080
simple and the third channel is

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,880
analytics is a kind of role as it's very

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:50,910
similar to administrator but has a

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:52,350
longer horizon to view and analytics

00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,400
could analyze and predict data

00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:59,130
consistency choosing the right data

00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:02,670
format to store it and basically write

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:07,380
articles to explain to other people what

00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:10,940
is important or not and that's pretty

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,940
much it thank you

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,130
[Applause]

00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,159
here sink Balad Victor or of the talk

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,159
are there any questions

00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:42,619
hi do you think that you can operate

00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,259
such a system without review really on

00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:46,999
the reviews because I think also for

00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:49,190
Google there is a lot of fakes and spam

00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:50,899
and harassment in the database so I

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:57,669
think think you need lots of manpower to

00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:57,669
keep it clean service avi self-wringing

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:04,249
no I think well it's a tricky question

00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:04,759
of course how do we deal with spam

00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:06,740
bother

00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:08,690
I know people deal with kind of

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,289
violations in OpenStreetMap and people

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:15,769
draw some harassment zones on the map so

00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:17,690
of course we can think about it to not

00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:21,200
enter that world but on the other hand

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:24,980
if people need it for some kind of

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,799
aggregation and if we can at least says

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,840
that 90% of the data will be good then

00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,789
it's easier to throw away the data

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,610
component for example to map date which

00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:37,369
is interlinked here you just forget

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:39,860
about 10% of detected somehow and it

00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:41,149
doesn't break computability Vizard data

00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,269
for example if we are talking about

00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:47,119
reviews of photos because if 90% is good

00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:48,769
and later on not now but for example in

00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,100
the months we can detect what is good or

00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:52,820
bad

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,440
that's I think a win situation one that

00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,119
one benefit that we have in

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,399
OpenStreetMap sometimes and here I

00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:00,350
believe as well that we shouldn't detect

00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:03,769
we shouldn't kind of detect it

00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:06,080
momentarily but over time the violations

00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:08,869
become very clear so immediately you can

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,730
miss it but over time you can track it

00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:13,309
down similar what's happens with

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:16,580
Wikipedia and try to clean it it will

00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:22,519
never be perfect but 90% could be good

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:23,299
enough hey awesome idea I really

00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:25,070
appreciate it

00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:27,440
one question if how do you handle

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,389
changing permanent IDs or changing IDs

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,769
from OpenStreetMap because as far as I

00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:32,779
understand it if someone attacks a

00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:34,429
restaurant as a note and then someone

00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:36,200
else comes along deletes that note that

00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:38,299
makes a relation out of it that had for

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,389
example represents a house how does it

00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:42,950
how does your project so indeed very

00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:45,769
interesting present question because I

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:47,749
missed it in my presentation but love to

00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:50,150
answer so indeed it was a main problem

00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:52,400
we deal with so for example we could

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,080
use IDs from OpenStreetMap to associate

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,840
reviews but that that's a big problem

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,700
there is no permanent ID so of course

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,680
that's projects one of the main tasks

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,520
and that what we already did to assign

00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,200
new IDs permanent IDs that they consist

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,350
of two parts one is just random and

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,440
another encodes big radius of location

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:14,900
but the main thing is to maintain it in

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,970
sync with OpenStreetMap and what we

00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,430
figured out that location is not even

00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,940
the main problem the main problem is the

00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,520
name

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,070
so for example when you when new place

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,810
is open at the same place usually people

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,790
just share the same node but it's

00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:31,130
completely different place sometimes

00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,870
names change a little bit and then it's

00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,460
still the same people could understand

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:37,880
it but sometimes name changed a lot and

00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,480
it's clearly new place and we can we did

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,280
some automation but that's exactly what

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,180
administrators or we need to think about

00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:50,090
how to work with it we cannot expect osm

00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,340
will track the edges but what we can do

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,350
over time we have a possibility to merge

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,970
for example if in the month we realized

00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,890
okay that was the same place that they

00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,900
were there is a functionality to merge

00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,690
back and basically to build up the whole

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:05,500
history nicely so and that's a core idea

00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:09,170
we need to work get working first to

00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:11,570
maintain at least 99% of places with

00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:14,300
permanent ID and permanent ID is not

00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:17,210
just location it's a kind of logical

00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:19,900
thing it's kind of a legal thing as well

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,900
and sometimes

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:33,990
you said that blockchain can clearly use

00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:36,299
or you don't want to use proof of work

00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,640
and your mentioned proof of stake what

00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:43,130
are you now actually using therefore

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,870
this database like blockchain so for our

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:48,059
open place reviews we are not going to

00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:51,510
use any kind of consensus in the

00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:54,150
beginning so it will be one central

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,860
server for simplification but we

00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,590
selected some algorithm strings to great

00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,059
later proof of work doesn't help and

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,940
doesn't work but there is a

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,950
decentralized crews of stake when main

00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,990
kind of servers which create blocks are

00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:10,230
selected based on voting we are not

00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:13,559
going to write that but we are going to

00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:15,419
reuse existing algorithms and and of

00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:18,090
course first servers will be associated

00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:20,309
with we think with the companies with

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,140
all these people names that we know for

00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:24,450
example we can trust that person it's

00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,640
not like we don't know each other we

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:29,429
meet in the conference and we know who

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,070
for example what most month was Maps me

00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:34,230
what other projects and if we associate

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:37,350
people with the beginning I think it

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:39,780
could work fine but as a prototype we

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:41,640
are not working on consensus part yet we

00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,299
have working mostly on API and storing

00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,730
information

00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:48,210
now that sounds much more like a key

00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:51,600
signing scheme than a blockchain or am I

00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:54,299
mistaken so it still follows a

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,370
blockchain as a database definition

00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:58,980
because it produces blocks they are

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:01,530
replicated across multiple devices just

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,210
as there are roles in a blockchain there

00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,820
is a concept of role who can produce a

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:08,490
block and so far it is in code is that

00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,080
role is assigned only to one server of

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,030
course later on it will be assigned to

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,090
many and then they will need to build

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:17,660
that consensus but that consensus yeah

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:21,179
it's it's simpler to follow to that

00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:23,790
decentralized rules of stake consensus

00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:28,919
which is implemented already in some

00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:30,260
routines so thank you again Victor for

00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,130
the talk and

00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,130
all the best for your project

00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,770
