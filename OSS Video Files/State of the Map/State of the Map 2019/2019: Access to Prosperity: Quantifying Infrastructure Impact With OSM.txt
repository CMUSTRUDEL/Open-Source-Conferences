Title: 2019: Access to Prosperity: Quantifying Infrastructure Impact With OSM
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2019
Description: 
	In many regions of the world, a population’s access to essential services is unduly constrained by a lack of proper infrastructure. By performing accessibility analysis using OSM data, we can understand how route infrastructure impacts access to essential services and use that information to inform an intervention.

This talk explores accessibility analysis performed to understand the impact of footbridge construction in eSwatini and introduces a python framework enabling users to perform similar analysis.

Bridges over rivers are fundamental pieces of human infrastructure which enable safe crossings for the populations who use them. However, many rural regions of the world lack these critical bridges, and as a result, access to essential services is restricted for millions of people.

In pursuit of tackling poverty caused by rural isolation, we have begun experimenting using remote analysis techniques to quantify bridge need and impact. To these ends, accessibility analyses using OSM and other data have proven to be extremely valuable.

By comparing a population’s baseline accessibility to its access in scenarios such as a flood or post bridge construction, one can better understand the transportation dynamics of a region and even estimate the number of people that would be impacted with a bridge construction, for example.

During the course of running various accessibility models, a python framework tebetebe was built around OSRM [Open Source Routing Machine] which simplifies the process of running different scenarios. This framework is built with footbridges in mind but is generalized so it may be applied to other applications.

This talk explores the accessibility analysis process, its caveats and results achieved in the Kingdom of eSwatini. Finally, a walkthrough of the python framework tebetebe is given so that other users may perform similar analyses.

yeah whatever you want a next session

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:15,230
very very looking forward to the hearing

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,970
the next talk on David David Owen but

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,009
access to prosperity quantify and

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,869
infrastructure impact with OpenStreetMap

00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:22,910
and he's gonna talk a little bit yeah I

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:24,230
learned before it is traveling a lot so

00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,150
I'm very looking forward in doing the

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,340
amazing things developing software for

00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,900
different kind of yeah to address

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,029
different kind of challenges not

00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,769
specifically looking at the impact of

00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:35,449
the lack of infrastructures and how we

00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:37,610
can actually the impact of actually

00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:39,739
overcoming these challenges as well yeah

00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,229
let's give the floor to you great thank

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:44,809
you for the introduction Melanie so yeah

00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:46,540
my name is Davey lovin and today I'm

00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:49,299
going to talk about quantifying

00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:52,309
infrastructure impact with OpenStreetMap

00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,720
and so my agenda today I'm gonna talk

00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:55,640
about some community development

00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,540
projects that I've been working on in sy

00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,129
teeny and I'm also gonna talk about how

00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,320
we're using data analysis and

00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:05,420
OpenStreetMap to help maximize our

00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,270
impact in those projects and I'm also

00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,830
that will lead to talking about this

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,719
Python package that I've written in

00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,210
order to help quantify infrastructure

00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:18,350
impact and how you can also use that

00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,820
yourself so first of all where is a SWAT

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,759
teeny and I'm just curious how many

00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:26,539
people here know where s Latini or

00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,140
Swaziland is alright yeah a good show

00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:29,420
everybody

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,359
and then I guess for those who don't

00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,880
know it's down here in southern Africa

00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:38,450
it's this cute little country nestled in

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,200
between South Africa and Mozambique and

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,679
Swaziland also a SWAT teeny it's it's

00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,840
quite a small country in fact it's about

00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:51,469
double the circumference of the London

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,200
metro area so not a huge country but for

00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:57,020
what it lacks in size it makes up for in

00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,240
hills so this is just a map of the

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,429
terrain ruggedness and you can see the

00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,630
left part of the country or the West is

00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:08,149
super hilly and it's just when you go on

00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,569
the ground in Swaziland this is what you

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,090
see

00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:12,560
it's just hills and you've got a lot of

00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,900
cattle and all of these little

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,590
homesteads kind of dotted on the

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,360
hillside so also in addition to a lot of

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,270
hills

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,970
Swaziland has got a lot of rivers and

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:28,510
I'm gonna focus on this little portion

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:30,040
right here in Swaziland in fact this is

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,690
the backyard of the house that I was

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,400
staying at for the last couple months I

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,040
took this picture about two months ago

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,230
or started two weeks ago and this is the

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,840
winter and you can see over to the left

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:44,080
here you've got this little river going

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,090
by and it's the dry season so the rivers

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,890
not so high but I just want you guys to

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,890
focus on that little slide in the

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,740
background there this is what it looks

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:57,490
like in the rainy season so the rivers

00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,980
swell like crazy and it becomes quite an

00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,900
issue in fact I love trail running right

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,150
across the river but in the summer I

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,140
just can't get there because the rivers

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,180
are so wide it just rains all the time

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,800
and so that's a little bit of an issue

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,930
for me but for a lot of people in

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,420
Swaziland it's actually a big issue for

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,160
them to get to their nearest services

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,770
and particularly this is a news article

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,090
about River flooding and people not

00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,489
being able to get to school for about

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,080
two weeks so it's a little issue for me

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,720
but for a lot of other people it's a big

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,970
one and this is exacerbated by the lack

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,130
of proper infrastructure in order to get

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,500
over these rivers and this is just a

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,209
picture of what some river crossings

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,190
really do look like typically just

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:42,100
really makeshift crossings that are

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:47,380
really inadequate for providing traffic

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:49,690
year-round so with that in mind for you

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,880
friends of mine about three years ago we

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,380
heard of this need and we decided that

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,420
we wanted to do something about it this

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,620
is a group of us we were University

00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,380
students of the University of Colorado

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,970
and we kind of sent it to Swaziland to

00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,880
see if we can help address these

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,820
challenges we went to the communities

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,520
and we visited we heard about their need

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,620
we did technical surveys with our survey

00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,050
equipment and then we had the great

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,700
fortune of meeting this organization

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,019
called Swaziland microprojects which is

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,209
a governmental organization that we

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,040
partnered with with funding and other

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,500
resources in order to implement some

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,640
foot bridges for the country super dope

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,260
so we ended up breaking ground about a

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,249
year later on our first foot bridge in

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,009
Swaziland

00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:39,639
and that was really just overall amazing

00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:42,729
amazing time missing program and you

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,439
know actually I'm just gonna this is I

00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:48,879
want you guys to also get an idea of

00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:50,979
what it is like to to be in these

00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,169
community projects because we're not a

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:56,319
major developmental organization we are

00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,059
straight-up mixing concrete by hand with

00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,699
community members and we are building

00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:02,709
these foot bridges with the people on

00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,569
the ground so we're not huge

00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:09,909
organization we are just about the

00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:11,049
people and so in the end we got

00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:14,679
ourselves a footbridge and it was a

00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:18,610
humongous success and then we built

00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:20,289
another and another and overall so far

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,539
we have six foot bridges that we've

00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,009
built in the country so far and as far

00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,989
as the theme of this conference being

00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:28,239
bridging the map we've officially added

00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:32,619
six foot bridges to the map so far and

00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:34,899
Counting so now what though so we've

00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:36,729
started these programs and we want to

00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:38,799
build all these foot bridges to provide

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:40,329
access to the entire country but the way

00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:43,209
that we were going wasn't in a

00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:44,919
sustainable kind of scaleable way so we

00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:47,110
decided to kind of scale up our efforts

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,749
and change their our approach in order

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,419
to really solve this problem for the

00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,979
whole entire country so to do that we

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,209
want to develop a partnership structure

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,219
and perform our national needs

00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:58,599
assessment I'm gonna focus on this

00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:01,959
national needs assessment because it's

00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:03,669
really relevant to OpenStreetMap so when

00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,289
you perform a national needs assessment

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,360
you got to figure out where is there a

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:11,739
need for foot bridges in the entire

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,779
country so the way that we used to do it

00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:16,149
would be we were just here a foot bridge

00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:18,249
need kind of through the grapevine and

00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:19,989
then we would visit and we'd meet with

00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:21,909
these people go to the bridge site and

00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:24,789
see if there was a need go for all the

00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:26,019
technical analysis but you know it works

00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:27,489
and it's great but it's really time

00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,439
consuming you end up spending all day

00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:31,179
and as much as I love hanging out in the

00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,529
rural areas and you know going to

00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:34,689
people's homesteads you know we really

00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:36,249
we want to figure out this problem on

00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:38,679
the whole entire country so we're gonna

00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:40,800
need a new approach so that new approach

00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:43,710
is all powered

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,150
OpenStreetMap so what we do is we visit

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,699
these tink homeland meetings and here we

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,889
have the 50:19 hula in the country and

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,930
every Tuesday they've gathered together

00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:54,300
for development we go there we present

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,949
our projects and we record the lawn last

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,430
of the potential bridges that these

00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:00,750
local leaders have identified so this is

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,340
literally I mean this is just what it

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,289
looks like we sit down with these local

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,449
leaders and they show us where they need

00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:09,180
infrastructure they also show us where

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,830
they would be going crossing at that

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,599
infrastructure and then they also tell

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,729
us things like flood prone bridges which

00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,659
will be crucial to our flood models that

00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:17,669
we do later on

00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:19,860
and we take all this stuff and we put it

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,449
into OpenStreetMap we're also training

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,520
some local guys like this is my man

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,740
Steven Issa right here to do this and in

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,590
fact they are doing it as we speak for

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,990
the entire country and the second part

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,969
is these traveling salesman site visits

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,229
and it's not like we've figured out the

00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:35,669
routes with the Traveling Salesman

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:37,259
algorithm we're really just traveling

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:40,110
around kind of selling these foot

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:42,719
bridges to the local leaders and we've

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,580
been able to get our efficiency up to

00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:46,620
about four sites that we can visit per

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,900
day whereas it was one before just by

00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,900
scheduling all these sites in a row and

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,659
we navigate to these sites with osm

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,620
Android and we're using ODK for the

00:07:54,659 --> 00:08:00,509
on-the-ground assessments so yeah we

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,400
record all sorts information at each

00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:03,870
site including its technical and social

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,870
survey and we collect a lot of site

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,430
media for every place that these is it

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,479
and yeah this is just what it looks like

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,479
it's a beautiful country

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,400
so the third part about it is the

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,039
footbridge impact analysis which is what

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,770
I'm gonna focus on here today

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,900
so after going all these bridge sites we

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,729
have a ton of these potential sites and

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,740
we have a bunch of technical and social

00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,630
data and what we really want is a

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,250
prioritized list of sites we don't know

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,990
what will happen in the future we want

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,000
to really prioritize the ones that are

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,839
most important and so that we can

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,579
address those first but then collected

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,260
impact data was unreliable if you ask

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:42,329
people how many people are impacted by

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,250
the footbridge they're gonna be you know

00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:45,300
saying a lot of people because they know

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,220
that the more in

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,720
the more likelihood that we will build

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,430
the bridge there so we want to

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,980
deterministic approach to figure out the

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,690
impact of these foot bridges so I'm

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,970
gonna show you guys what we're doing and

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,090
I'm gonna do a little example here this

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,830
little region of the country down yonder

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,410
so here we have a satellite view of a

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,450
community at Fletch any in Swaziland

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,340
and you can see here we've got this big

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,100
river coming through that and when PC

00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,320
River and we've got all of these cute

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,020
little homesteads dotted on the hillside

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,340
that's an orange and then we've also got

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,260
a route network so these are all the

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,690
little roads and the dotted lines are

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,880
all the pathways and of particular

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,560
importance for these models are the

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,200
Fords and so for those of you who don't

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,300
know the Fords are where highways meet

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:34,320
waterways and there's no infrastructure

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:37,080
like a bridge say and so we were brought

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,260
to this particular Ford by a community

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,450
leader who said they really have an

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,430
issue going to sell well a primary

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,550
school across the river amongst other

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,020
places and that they wanted a footbridge

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,620
here so that they could increase access

00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:55,860
to this primary school so in order to

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,210
run to understand the impact that we

00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,950
would have by building this footbridge

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,990
here we're going to do a routing

00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,450
scenario comparison we're going to

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,070
compare a normal access model with a

00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,560
flood access model to answer the

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,630
question what impact is a flood have on

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,150
this region and then we're going to

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,400
compare a flood model with a bridge

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:18,360
model which would say what impact does a

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,070
bridge have in event of a flood so here

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,350
we're gonna run normal vs. flood

00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:25,830
scenario so this is a normal scenario

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,780
where these Fords are crossable and say

00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,940
the water is low you can hop from rock

00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,620
to rock and it's not a huge issue though

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,660
it isn't inconvenience we're going to

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,810
compare that to a flood scenario where

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:40,560
those those Fords are blocked and people

00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:42,000
can no longer cross there so the houses

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,329
in green are

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,639
ones that the model has said they are

00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:49,860
have a different that it's different

00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,350
between on normal and flood scenario so

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,600
these are homesteads that are impacted

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,720
by a flood and you can see that by

00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,029
looking at the routes so these green

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,980
routes when routed or green homesteads

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,600
when routed to the primary school you

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,639
know they can go just straight across

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,490
these Fords without an issue and that's

00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,430
the way that they would go to the school

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,959
the fastest route but then when you look

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,759
at the flood-affected routes I mean

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,560
they've got to go all the way up to the

00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,019
top of the screen over to the main road

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,209
and down and though I don't have a scale

00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,670
here that's about seven eight kilometers

00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:24,930
and so often these children just don't

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,569
go to school because it's such a long

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:30,240
walk and so next we're gonna do a

00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:31,800
scenario flood versus bridge so here

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,689
again we have the flood scenario where

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,110
all those boards are blocked but then

00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:39,750
we're gonna upgrade that one Ford to a

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,389
bridge and see what happens so the

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:45,720
purple homesteads are the ones that it's

00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:47,160
shows are affected by a bridge and these

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,569
are the routes that they would take in

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,809
flood similar to what they were just

00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:55,319
before and then when you put a bridge in

00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:56,819
as you can see they all can go across

00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:59,759
the bridge and that is their shortest

00:11:56,819 --> 00:12:01,589
route to get to that primary school so

00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,480
on top of being able to visualize the

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,730
difference in between flood and

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,040
in-between bridges it's really nice um

00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,240
oh actually before I say that I just

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,980
want to show that there's a difference

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,439
between the flood verse bridge scenario

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,930
and the bridge verse Ludd scenario so

00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,519
the green homesteads are impacted by a

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,899
flood but they're not impacted by the

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,559
bridge and you can see these guys on the

00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,180
right here

00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,620
they aren't impacted by the bridge

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,959
because they would have to cross that

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,550
first ford before they'd get to the

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,059
bridge so it's just it's an interesting

00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:34,379
way to visualize the dynamics of flood

00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:36,899
and access in a particular place so on

00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:39,149
top of the visualization we get this

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,069
data that we can use to answer questions

00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:43,259
like how much time and distance is saved

00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:46,170
for each homestead on average so we have

00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,110
the flood or the normal distance the

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,850
normal

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,650
the flood and the bridge and we can

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,180
compare that to answer the question

00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,010
what's the average time saved

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,110
how many homesteads are impacted and

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,760
start to answer more complicated

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:01,110
questions just load that thing into our

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,450
and have a field day with all that data

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,130
so when I was running this analysis when

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,540
I was running this scenario stuff I

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,820
thought to myself this is I'm not the

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,310
only person out there that wants to run

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,440
routing scenarios and so I decided like

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,030
I'm gonna build a Python package for the

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,800
good of the open-source community

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,570
because I love you guys so that if

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,060
anyone wants to do similar routing

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,160
analysis it will be SuperDuper easy so I

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,960
created an epoch today which is a debit

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,600
debit which is means footbridge in to

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,490
spot C and it's a wrapper a Python API

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,800
around the open source routing machine

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,390
so you guys can run routing analysis

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,940
super easy and I'm gonna show you guys

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,220
real quick how it works so here we have

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,560
a scenario schematic and all of these

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,900
bubbles here are classes within the

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,300
Python API so you've got a routing

00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,280
profile that can be either car bicycle

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,200
or in my case that I just used it would

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,810
be a flood profile and then you've got

00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,330
an OS M data set that could be an geo

00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,580
fabric extract that can be overpass

00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,410
query and then you pipe those into a

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,630
scenario that will show you you know a

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,930
routing scenario for a particular data

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,000
set then in Python you call this

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,340
scenario which compiles it and then it

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,070
provides a context manager to serve the

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:14,890
HTTP API so that you can query the

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,270
scenario and get routes and tables all

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,120
the things that you would want when

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:22,470
you're doing routing and then in that

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,270
scenario API you can you know run

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:28,090
origins and destinations with pio I

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:30,940
datasets and the way that I've written

00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:32,860
it as well you can you can create a Pio

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,020
idea set from anything from an OG R so I

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,140
like a shape file or an overpass query

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,720
and you can pipe in an OS M data set

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,310
from a PDF file or overpass and so what

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,740
this allows you to do is really you can

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,540
very much just with various overpass

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,760
queries pull the route network and then

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:52,720
pull the PIO is and then run this

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:55,520
routing on the fly so in particular

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,170
before like I said the foot profile

00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,120
and the normal scenario this is what it

00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,370
looked like I just put profile with the

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,010
Swaziland PBF I piped that into the

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,660
Swazi foot scenario called it it's an

00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,160
API and then the origins of the

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,440
homesteads and the destinations were the

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,580
schools the flood scenario is a similar

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,990
sort of thing the only thing that's

00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,460
different is the flood profile and I

00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,710
want to zoom up real quick on this flood

00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,140
profile because I think it's really neat

00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:20,450
to see what the difference was I just

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,910
took the normal profile for walking and

00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,980
I added a way handler and a node handle

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,050
are super simple super readable you can

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,600
just see here if bridge is yes flood

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:33,320
prone equals yes return false right like

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,320
don't route here if the block if Ford

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,390
equals yes it's a barrier super simple

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,830
super readable I really like OS R M

00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,170
because of this and I think it's a

00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,480
really readable reproducible routing

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,270
analysis so I would love if you guys

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,950
want to use it and here's a little

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,110
script just to see what's going on it's

00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,820
super simple you initialize the scenario

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,430
with the PDF file and like a default

00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,080
foot profile and then with scenario and

00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,150
then the parenthesis you call it it

00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,010
returns itself provides a context

00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,620
manager so that you can query it with

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,060
the routing I you know I'm not doing

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,160
something super novel here I'm just

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,830
making it really easy for people to run

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,510
routing scenarios because it was a bit

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:15,020
complex when I was looking to do it

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,490
first myself and that's what it will

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,230
tell you this particular example it

00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,200
gives you just a quick little duration

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,570
and distance so the features right now

00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,120
it's got a the core of it is this OS RM

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,220
scenario API that you can call and it's

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,290
super easy to you know start up a

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,720
routing engine it's also got

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,150
accessibility isochrones it does route

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,490
comparison which will allow you to do

00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:39,620
just what I did before in fact all the

00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,300
example of the code and the results that

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,070
I have are now

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,620
and on the examples so you can check

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,269
that out and it provides a bit of an

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,010
analysis pipeline which just makes it

00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:50,480
easy just to grab the data pull it all

00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,029
in do the analysis and spit out

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,680
something useful I would like to

00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:56,750
implement shared memory which would be

00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,700
neat which is where you can you know

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,160
update the node and edge weights in real

00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,649
time and so you don't have to recompile

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,230
the scenarios I'd like to do awesome Ian

00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,689
filters which could allow programmable

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,870
updates of the network we really need

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,910
parallelization and all this other wish

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,189
list sort of stuff and I'm continuing to

00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,929
development on this even though it's

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:19,880
been I mean it serves the purposes for

00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:21,620
me but I'm just gonna do it because I

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,010
have a feeling somebody might want it

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,410
out there the caveats of this all I just

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,559
want to mention the HTTP API which it

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:33,020
takes in order to query for a particular

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,280
route it introduces a lot of overhead if

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,290
you're gonna be running a bajillion

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,450
requests you're gonna be having a lot of

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,000
a bottleneck with all these HTTP

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,130
requests there's a bunch of i/o between

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,960
the OSM data and then writing the

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,210
scenarios and also the default routing

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,040
profiles you really gotta be careful I

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,620
mean look over here you see these guys

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,320
that are crossing the river and then

00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,760
crossing it back to get to the school I

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,650
mean that's not realistic I should

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,020
definitely go in there and then have a

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,390
time delay for førde equals yes I just

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,550
want you all to be careful and not just

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,840
run it with the default profile and

00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,460
you're like oh wow I got some results

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,070
you know you really got to look into it

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,200
so check out the docs I wrote a bunch of

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,570
documentation a bunch of script examples

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,510
so that you know some of you might find

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,970
it useful and then be able to use it and

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,290
I would love if you did if you do you

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,710
should just holler at me because it

00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:27,080
would totally make my day so yeah great

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,230
I made it to the end of the talk thank

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,239
goodness

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,619
and yeah real quick acknowledgments I

00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:33,659
want to acknowledge you all people

00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:35,970
everything that I written was completely

00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:37,649
open-source and you know written by the

00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,419
open-source community I'm just building

00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,399
I'm on the shoulders of giants which is

00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:43,379
all you guys so thank you so much

00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:44,909
everybody I also want to thank all these

00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:46,529
children that mapped a bunch of houses

00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:48,119
in Swaziland that have been using in my

00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:49,230
model and thanks to all the Italian

00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,629
people that made that happen

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,970
OSR em you guys are the homies you made

00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:54,570
a really great routing engine

00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,429
OpenStreetMap foundation is sponsoring

00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,799
me to be here at Mapple stated because

00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:01,919
they've inspired me so much with doing

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,659
mapping yeah and also all my homies in

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,919
Swaziland because this is like seriously

00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,690
the best thing that ever happened to me

00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,399
on this yeah the projects that we're

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,600
working on so super dope if you want to

00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:13,409
check out more of our projects go a

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,249
purchase org and yeah this is me check

00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:17,369
me out on the web

00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:19,049
github osm and couchsurfing I'm

00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:21,210
traveling through Europe if you want to

00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,509
host me any couch would be dope and yeah

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,509
thank you

00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,300
right yeah thank you so much thanks much

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,920
david brothers are there any questions

00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,370
for Davey I think it's good for every

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,370
year yeah

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,050
hi thanks that was super interesting my

00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,120
question is did you receive any pushback

00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,330
that you didn't expect when doing this

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,330
project

00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,660
hmmm

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,580
yes well they're very much pretty much

00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,920
everyone told us that we couldn't do it

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,179
at the beginning when we were trying to

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,520
set up this program I mean we were

00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:12,070
really university students just figuring

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,410
it out one step at a time so we got

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,390
plenty of people who told us we couldn't

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,340
do it at the beginning but then once the

00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,640
ball started rolling it was a bit of

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:24,130
kind of just a project unto its own and

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,330
now we're at the point where we're

00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,340
really well established when the

00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,110
government really highly regarded in the

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,880
programs in a building and expanding

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,559
we're hiring a bunch of Swasey and

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,080
essentially they're running it on their

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,990
own I've essentially taught them all a

00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,630
bunch of Swasey how to do all of the

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,880
work that I was doing so it's now you

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,040
know it's just the kind of the next

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,020
level so I would say we had pushback

00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,179
initially but once you once you bring

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,100
people to one of these bridges yeah it's

00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,190
like you know it's a whole different

00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,190
level

00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,990
not any more questions from the audits

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,990
yep

00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:15,160
hi there thanks for a very exciting

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:18,760
presentation cool project I have a

00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:22,660
technical question perhaps I missed it

00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:26,620
but have I understood that your your

00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:29,470
metric of distance or time that they are

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:33,280
essentially interchangeable that they

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:35,140
are just a constant factor different or

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,720
is there something that you do about

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,660
terrain computation so that you account

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,720
also for hill slopes of the trails that

00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,780
people need to walk yeah that's a great

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,000
question so the default routing profile

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,250
is what I use for the time metric and

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,660
the distance is just what it returns you

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,890
know when you're when you look at the

00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,680
route and you just calculate the

00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:59,800
distance you know on the ground but in

00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,600
particular you're correct that for a

00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,060
walking profile it's really critical to

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,910
have elevation data in there and as you

00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:09,280
could see even on the example it shows

00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,410
various routes that are going down the

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,770
hill and then back up and you got a

00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:18,010
figure that that's not realistic so it

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:20,530
does not incorporate that elevation

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,730
profile but the thing about it was I

00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,020
mean at the beginning of project I was

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,450
like yeah right my own routing engine

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,070
sounds dope I was like man I got way too

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,830
deep into it right but that's why I

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,780
built it around OS RM because OS RM does

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,710
have that functionality to incorporate

00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,290
raster elevation data in the calculation

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,470
that it makes for distance and time and

00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:44,800
so I don't say I would use those

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:48,310
interchangeably they're just useful to

00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,170
understand when looking you know I

00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,090
wouldn't use them both together but I

00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,650
would use them separately say you're

00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,820
saving a certain amount of distance or a

00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,050
certain amount of time when we're

00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,050
talking to different stakeholders

00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:13,899
yeah amazing work I may have a coach for

00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:17,499
you after Delta here's my question

00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:19,419
the it's some amazing stuff here and you

00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:23,289
thank the community that you worked with

00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:25,119
and I'd have been Canada and for me to

00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:27,339
get high school students to do something

00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,320
in their own backyard similar to this is

00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:32,039
like pulling teeth have you thought

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:36,279
about your experience working in these

00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:38,499
so-called developing countries that we

00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:40,509
could benefit from say back in Denver

00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:43,449
where they're looking at climate

00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:45,759
resilience in others similar issues that

00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:48,599
they're dealing with just super good

00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,099
question so I will say when you're

00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:54,009
coalescing a community underneath a

00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:57,039
tangible infrastructure is really

00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:59,319
powerful because it's less of a vaporous

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,349
idea for instance you know as opposed to

00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:03,669
climate change right and so I think a

00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:05,649
lot of the strength in our projects I

00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:09,309
mean we have people volunteering their

00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:12,699
labor entirely you know all day long for

00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:15,369
various weeks and I think unfortunately

00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:17,739
it's like the motivation is so much

00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:20,589
stronger in these communities somehow

00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:21,969
then I see in actually I did live in

00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:24,159
Denver as well at some point you know

00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:25,989
between people also you got to figure

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,819
that the life in these homesteads I mean

00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:29,379
people are just chilling I mean they

00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:32,109
don't they're don't have 9 to 5 s are

00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:34,659
not stressed right so it's really easier

00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:37,329
to motivate and organize and you know a

00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:39,609
project like this when people are you

00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:41,139
know also very starved for development

00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:42,459
right because this I mean these are some

00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:46,359
of the nicest pieces of infrastructure

00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:48,759
around so unfortunately I don't have off

00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,829
the top of my head and on the spot a way

00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:53,109
that you could you know coalesce or

00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:56,919
start something like this and say Denver

00:24:53,109 --> 00:25:00,009
but I think it all comes down to really

00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,559
like making the people like believe like

00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:04,779
something that they can tangibly do and

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,799
then it's not such a just a vaporous

00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:10,089
idea of telling them and we actually do

00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,639
when we start these projects we actually

00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:14,250
bring the community leaders we ask them

00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:16,110
to form a bridge committee and we

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,610
one of the other foot bridges and when

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,460
they go back to their community I mean

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,620
they just you know it's it's just

00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,840
obvious to these people like once you

00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:33,360
can really show them the tangible

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:36,840
results of them working together hi

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,770
thanks and I'm wondering how do the

00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:43,140
results from your quantitative analysis

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,580
filter into the prior ization process of

00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,970
deciding where to build the next

00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,860
footbridge and in relation to that how

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:53,750
do you deal with like completeness of

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:57,350
data like how do you assess in which

00:25:53,750 --> 00:26:00,330
community you like which percent of

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:03,630
houses are actually mapped because this

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:09,360
obviously has a big influence on your

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:13,890
results great questions so to the last

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,600
one so actually I I'm sure you guys

00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,190
realize I talked really fast I wasn't

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,480
about to like shove some more stuff in

00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,760
that presentation but actually in

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,140
between when we first visit the in Kulas

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,600
and then when we actually do the site

00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,700
visits we run like a mapathon by the way

00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,610
that mapathon is usually just me right

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:34,440
but also really great is that these

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:37,470
children have made a huge amount of

00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,100
buildings that are available in s

00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,850
martini

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:43,230
so these children at also actually

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:45,420
typically it's just me adding the route

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,100
networks and the Fords I'm in order to

00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,600
do these studies which is really

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,910
manageable at scale as opposed to

00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,530
tracing all these buildings and actually

00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:57,390
what was the first question got it so

00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,980
also you know the benefit of our

00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,050
projects being like community-based

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,370
initiatives you know we don't have like

00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,570
these crazy you know

00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,980
you know four or five letter

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,230
organizations that are you know really

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,930
you know like we need proof or whatnot

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,670
really the biggest thing is that you

00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,620
know and like I you can do the data

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,270
analysis like I showed but really it's

00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,920
the visualizations to talk to these

00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,150
government people because you know

00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,490
people in Swasey really you're just like

00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,899
look at this

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,909
and they're like okay yeah we get it

00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:25,130
right and so really more or less for

00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:27,289
proving it to ourselves we're not really

00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:29,450
proving it to others because in the end

00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:31,669
we are the ones that are the driving

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:34,520
forces behind these projects so it's

00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:37,490
really it comes out of our own internal

00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,710
desire to make these the most impactful

00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:42,200
it's not about proof for somebody else

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,039
in order to kind of fund our projects or

00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,669
something like that

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:49,100
that's a great question maybe if time

00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:54,460
for quick one just before we go to the

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,460
lunch break yeah

00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,390
a great hope thanks very much it's super

00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,220
important obviously to get kids to kids

00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,620
to school but were there other metrics

00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,000
as well such as farmers getting their

00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,640
crops to market and that sort of thing

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,170
that were important to the analysis yeah

00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,610
absolutely and if I understood the

00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,960
question correctly it was just that you

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,670
know in this particular example I'll use

00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,160
just just one school but there's other

00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:29,370
locations that people go to absolutely

00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,050
so you know for this visualization that

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,070
I put on here I wanted to make it really

00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,380
simple or else there would be just

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,600
routes everywhere but also like I say

00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,210
when we do the community when we go to

00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,490
these in Kuma's and we find all the POS

00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,130
it's actually more than just one

00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,200
destination that we're recording

00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:48,990
typically it's schools in clinics and

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,270
nearest towns slash public transport

00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:54,150
that's like the top ones sometimes you

00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:55,590
know like spiritual healers and football

00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,750
fields and things like that but we do

00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,270
record all these things together and

00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:01,860
they are a part of the analysis and

00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,390
visualizations that we make I just

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:07,770
simplified it for this particular

00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:09,990
example in the route comparison scenario

00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,630
or sorry the route comparison class that

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:18,510
I built you know it takes multiple

00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:20,520
destinations into account ok great thank

00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,570
you very much baby I think gray we have

00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,570
