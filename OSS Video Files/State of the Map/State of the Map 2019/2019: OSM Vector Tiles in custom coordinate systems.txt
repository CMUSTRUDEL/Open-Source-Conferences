Title: 2019: OSM Vector Tiles in custom coordinate systems
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2019
Description: 
	OpenMapTiles is an open-source set of tools for processing OpenStreetMap data into vector maps, which can be produced in various coordinate systems.

OpenMapTiles is an open-source set of tools for processing OpenStreetMap data into zoomable and web-compatible vector tiles, which are ready to use in OpenLayers, Mapbox GL, Leaflet, QGIS as well as mobile applications. 

This talk gives an overview of the OpenMapTiles tools to produce vector tiles in coordinate systems other than Mercator while keeping all the features, such as interactivity to create powerful region-specific applications.

Today’s de-facto global standard is a Spherical Mercator projection because it preserves shape and angles. The entire world looks like a square, which makes it easy to work with on a computer. However, such a transformation causes several issues like distortion of sizes where places around the equator are visually smaller than those near poles. That’s why new global coordinate systems were developed.

There are also many local coordinate systems with a long tradition. They perfectly fit the need to display a particular country/area in the most acceptable way. They are heavily used, especially by governments. OpenMapTiles can serve as a base map for displaying data in a different coordinate system or for view/print purposes.

There is also a hosting service based on OpenMapTiles called MapTiler Cloud, which offers the same ability to be displayed in a different coordinate system than Mercator.

good afternoon and welcome everybody to

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,940
their talk by Rico Merrick on all some

00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:19,620
vector tile in custom coordinate system

00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,430
it's going to be a 20 minutes talk and

00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,860
five minutes for questions thank you

00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,670
okay thank you for the introduction so

00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,760
hi everyone

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:34,559
thanks for coming I'm Mary I'm from the

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:38,730
met tire team and well what we do it's

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,339
like apart from providing some beautiful

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,890
base maps those you can see satellite

00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:47,850
maps and so on we are also working on a

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,829
lot of open source projects and today

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,499
I'm going to present one of them which

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:58,109
is called open map tiles by using this

00:00:54,499 --> 00:01:02,519
project this this spec you can create

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:05,880
your own vector tiles and you can also

00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:09,360
create them in your own coordinate

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,469
systems on the very beginning not

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,750
everybody here has like GIS background

00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:18,570
so what are the what are the different

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:23,070
projections or the coordinate systems

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:27,950
what is it about the issue is that the

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:30,780
globe is well kind of around 3d object

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,990
unfortunately it's not flat otherwise it

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,939
would be really easy and we are trying

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:41,640
somehow to put this 3d globe into the

00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:46,200
two-dimensional screens or papers or

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:50,270
whatever and there are many ways how to

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:54,329
do it as you can see a lot of them are

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:57,689
well they are different but they have

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:02,460
one thing in common all of them are

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:05,130
wrong the only difference is the aspect

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,710
in which they are wrong so let's start

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,730
with with the most common one which is

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:14,430
Mercator you can see it's if you have

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:19,230
ever been to OpenStreetMap dot org you

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,870
can see there it's great for instance

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:28,469
for navigation

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:31,200
yeah it keeps the squares as they are on

00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:35,609
the other hand the biggest problem with

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,510
this projection is in the in the sizes

00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:41,189
so for instance here you can see the

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:44,310
greenland's which is much bigger than

00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:47,579
Europe well in fact it's almost like

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:51,030
five times smaller than Europe and not

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:55,049
talking about the countries or the area

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:58,769
around equator there the problem is much

00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:02,639
much bigger well the answer to this

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:06,230
could be gout Peters projections for

00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:09,840
instance which is correct in showing the

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,689
decisis however it's wrong in everything

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,389
else so you also don't want to use it or

00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:20,519
you can then for some reasons

00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:24,389
disappeared the third one sorry the

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:27,900
second one in the middle this is the

00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:29,819
French one Bert this is the example of

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,090
the local coordinate system which was

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,430
developed for a specific country in this

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:40,500
case it was for France I will talk about

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:44,010
the local coordinate system later on the

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:52,069
third one is not Lombard sorry the third

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:55,409
one on the third picture you can see how

00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:58,709
incorrect it is because is you know

00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:01,530
obviously that the Antarctica is not

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:06,599
that it has totally different shape then

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:09,870
it is in has in reality so but it's

00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:14,459
really great to show the areas around

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:18,870
the North Pole but there are other ways

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:21,989
how to show the globe but none of them

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:26,039
is really it's all of them are far from

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:28,389
being perfect apart from the from the

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,789
coordinate system which are trying to

00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:33,960
show the global data we have a lot of

00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:37,870
local coordinate systems because

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,870
historically speaking a lot of maths I

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:45,129
would say most of the maps were designed

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:48,220
to show some local data some kingdoms or

00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:53,490
even small areas like cities and so on

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:56,409
and for them it was much better to

00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:00,759
define their own coordinate system which

00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:06,130
fits their needs if you take an example

00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:09,130
of well let's say Norway you can see the

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,000
problem where it's but it looks a little

00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,560
bit like me

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,569
it's like real tall and slim and well if

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,870
you try to put me on the on a Mercator

00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,810
my feet will be correct my hips will

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,419
already like this and my head like that

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:29,129
so you don't want to do that but well

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:31,900
apparently we are doing it with Norway

00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:35,860
so a lot of those local coordinate

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:39,310
systems were created and they are still

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:42,460
in use even in the modern days even for

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,800
some smaller countries like Switzerland

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:53,469
or Czech Republic where this issue is

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:56,590
not that big however it still stays

00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:58,690
there and it will probably because it's

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:06,900
required by the governments and some

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:15,310
official bodies so yeah here you can see

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:19,449
yeah right you can see the vgs 84 vector

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:22,360
tiles in this vgs 84 projection which is

00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:24,669
already available on the map sauerkraut

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,180
so you can go there and you can start

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:30,849
using it you can crazy see it looks

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,529
somehow weird especially on the really

00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,529
high zoom levels right now

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:41,190
so this is one of the example of the of

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,280
the coordinate system we already have

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:48,070
and now if you want to use one of these

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,200
coordinate systems you have basically

00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,810
two options if you want to go with our

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,889
stack the first one the easiest one is

00:06:52,810 --> 00:07:00,060
just to go to Metacom such clouds create

00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:04,180
a free account and well start using it

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:07,000
as I said the vgs 84 is their lambert is

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,919
maybe already they're like our

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,100
developers are working today on

00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:14,470
deployment so if it's there it's still

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:18,070
hot if not it will be there today

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:24,450
tomorrow wednesday like this so check it

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:24,450
out and more coordinates are coming soo

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,470
what do you have there you can start

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:36,430
using with open layers which can show

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:41,400
both raster tiles and vector tiles or

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:44,979
you can also mix it and we also operate

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:51,100
the XY side because we are sterilized it

00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:55,240
on demand bpms or static Maps API so

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:59,740
that's the this easy way and now okay

00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:03,510
yeah one more thing right now there is

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,830
this basic style we will add more and

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:09,190
later on we will also add the

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:12,789
possibility of the of the our customized

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:16,710
tool which is available for the for the

00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:20,560
maps in Mercator but right now you can

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:23,860
write or you can import any style which

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,300
you create yourself so the heck for

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:30,190
today is like just create your own map

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,599
using this tool or the edit tool

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:36,460
download it just change the source and

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:42,190
upload it back and you have your own

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:43,180
style and now we are switching to open

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,780
map tiles

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:53,050
part let's say this is the way how you

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:55,990
can do it any of you can do it for those

00:08:53,050 --> 00:09:00,940
who still don't know open map tiles this

00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:04,890
is the set of open source to daily dis

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,780
used by we estimate 200 million people

00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:13,960
we don't know exactly how many because

00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:16,890
not everything is our users it is

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:22,690
already adopted by other companies like

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:26,560
carto or I know if there is someone else

00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:31,570
who is using it so we estimate 200

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:37,120
million people every day it's available

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:39,660
on open Taos org or on github or you can

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,560
find it there all the tools needed for

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:47,830
building how's it made so first there is

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:52,060
this vector tile schema which defines

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:57,310
the layers and attribute and this can be

00:09:52,060 --> 00:10:00,100
used with any kind of data what we use

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:04,540
most of the time it's OpenStreetMap

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:07,980
however for our own usage we also mix it

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:12,940
with other data so for zoom level 0 till

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:16,030
4 or 5 we use natural earth because it

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:20,130
has some much better look on those zoom

00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:23,770
levels we are also adding Vicky's data

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:29,560
the reason for that is other

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:31,180
translations because every city is or

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,580
most of the cities are much better

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:40,840
translated on Vicky's data than

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:43,770
OS M but you can also use it for your

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,910
own data it has been adopted by

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:51,190
Luxembourg national geo portal or the

00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:56,920
cartographic Institute of Catalonia yeah

00:10:51,190 --> 00:11:00,490
I can see yeah it was also the

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:06,430
inspiration for the for the UK Ordnance

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:10,120
Survey open zoom stack how we are

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:13,030
creating this well if this is just like

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,510
some overview how we are doing it if you

00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:19,930
want some step-by-step guide then you

00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:22,690
should search for open map tiles state

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:26,050
of the map 2018 there was a presentation

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:30,700
about this so there's really like clear

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:33,130
guide but basically you take the PDF

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,710
file with Open Street Map data you

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:42,930
import it into the database use passages

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:42,930
and then you generate those vector tiles

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:50,920
in the web box a vector tile format so

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:58,810
at the end you will also get again the

00:11:50,920 --> 00:12:01,780
PDF file in the MB tiles format so it's

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,820
quite confusing you you have PBF on the

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:08,320
very beginning but with the whole world

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,000
with like ten of gigabytes of data at

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,580
the end you have like a lot of those

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,500
small PBS in the form of vector tiles

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:23,950
and now you have the tiles so the last

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,260
step how to transform those tiles into

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:30,730
the real Maps it's you need to apply

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:34,750
some kind of style there are several of

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:37,960
them they are also available on the

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,810
github so you can use it for the photo

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:44,560
map generated from Open Street Map but

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,750
also you can use it for your own data in

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,140
case

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:55,340
you you stay compatible with the with

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:55,340
the schema so you can say for instance

00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:01,530
let's take everything from Overstreet

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:07,130
map except for roads because I have my

00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:11,670
own road if you if you follow the schema

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:20,840
then you can well get exactly the same

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:20,840
output as here and now we modified the

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:31,170
flow little bit and to be able render

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:36,780
the tiles in different coordinate

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:40,230
systems the difference is that at the

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:43,770
end we are storing in Geo package the

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:53,940
reason for that is the MB tiles format

00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:56,640
is by definition only in marketer and

00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:01,830
then yeah then you can already use it

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:06,480
with open layers and or with oil

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:13,290
netbooks style so it looks really the

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:17,750
same way as like the normal map since

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:24,420
the last presentation state of the map

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:29,570
2018 we made two releases 3.9 in

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:33,210
November the biggest change was in the

00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:36,270
water part but also we added the

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:42,400
multilingual street names that's the

00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:47,440
case for countries like Belgium or

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:55,720
Finland they have also to do official

00:14:47,440 --> 00:15:01,330
language is there and in 3.10 we updated

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:04,780
again the water layers and some

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:07,270
boundaries plus we added four new

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:13,420
languages yes

00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:17,020
also Basque and what is planned for the

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:22,270
future well right now the situation is

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:26,680
that we have a lot of repositories and

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:30,220
for the beginners or even for us it's

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:34,600
really hard to orient in it so we want

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:38,680
to make it somehow easier and what we

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:45,070
are also trying to define and achieve

00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:50,440
its to have like the basic set or to to

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:53,260
have to have a tool that creates the

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,350
base map I'd say and then have

00:15:53,260 --> 00:16:00,280
additional repositories for some

00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:03,690
specific use cases so the advantage is

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:06,760
it's really easy

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:11,010
somehow for the newcomers to start and

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:19,840
also to keep the size of the rendered

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:21,730
files to some like normal size and yeah

00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,330
of course if you are interested in

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:28,690
what's going on issues like for it a to

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:33,910
our blog post or start following us on

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:38,560
Twitter so how to get how to generate

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:40,089
the map yourself as I said it er you

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,240
watch the presentation from the last

00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:46,089
year or you can go to github and there

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,480
is the tutorial plus there is this

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:52,080
QuickStart shell script which you just

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,360
run and it will it will really guide you

00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:59,910
there is also the

00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:03,870
on open map tiles org and here you have

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:09,480
also this this view were when you can

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:11,760
see all the features which are there the

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,700
other option is of course that you just

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,330
download what is already pre generated

00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:23,190
that is for most of the users it is much

00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:29,100
better because well creating your own

00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:31,230
tiles it's quite costly so you can

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:36,330
either download it's free for

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:40,590
non-commercial use and well for prices

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:45,510
if you are a business so yep there are

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:48,920
also additional data layers one of them

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:52,380
is Hill shading digital elevation model

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:55,520
plus satellite which is Singh here but

00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:58,260
yeah we have it as well

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,830
and the project vision

00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:05,250
I already well I already said it we are

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:10,530
trying to keep the size somehow

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:14,870
low between 6070 gigabytes and have just

00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:19,310
some base map which contains the

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:22,590
important topographic information and

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:29,370
for the rest there will be this custom

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:34,950
additional layers so what we already

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:38,130
created we created one sample layer it's

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,560
available on the github it's it's a

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:46,050
layer which contains the things for

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:51,710
skiing like slopes and lists and things

00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:58,380
like that and we are also thinking about

00:18:51,710 --> 00:19:00,210
others other things other use cases yeah

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,550
here is this is not done by us

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,870
unfortunately but it's really beautiful

00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:08,690
for those who

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:13,680
no this is open infrastructure map and

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:18,530
all right and using it for showing or

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,530
the electric infrastructure and so on

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:29,850
what we we are working on right now this

00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:31,620
is this hiking map and yeah and as I

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,300
said on the very beginning this is not

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:38,309
the only thing which we are working on

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:40,980
we have other open source project the

00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:45,750
full list is on Metacom slash open

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:48,330
source one of them is PI server GL which

00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,040
is like the node.js server for running

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,120
your own map

00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:56,010
it has also we have also time server PHP

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,890
which is a simple script which you put

00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:03,210
on your PHP server put the mat next to

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:09,440
it and you have it you have the map OS m

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:13,100
names this is the geocoding service

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,790
based on the data from upper stream map

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:20,240
the interesting thing the ranking is

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:24,270
partially done of course it's done by

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:28,440
bounding box and so on but the hierarchy

00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:30,990
is also based on the on the Wikipedia it

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,720
means like the more the price is search

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:37,920
on Wikipedia the highest chances are

00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:41,490
that it will stay on the top here web

00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:43,890
grf as I said on a very beginning our

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:47,640
planet is a globe so this is really like

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:52,860
the 3d globe which you can put into your

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:55,610
webpage and a pc g io this is the

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,440
database of all the coordinate systems

00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:01,320
you can find everything what you can

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:06,780
ever heard of and probably never heard

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:11,870
of so yeah as i said check it out

00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,870
mattias go slash oppressors thank you

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,800
[Applause]

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:26,200
the interesting and informative talk

00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:28,990
you'll now ask for questions we have I

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,330
think four minutes but before everybody

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,900
else go we would like to make an

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:37,080
announcement that there's going to be a

00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:58,630
closing session and in the main hall add

00:21:37,080 --> 00:22:03,310
four questions comments my question is

00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:05,830
about the future of local projection in

00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,870
the open maptiler project this feature

00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:11,560
is already available or not because I

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:13,870
not see it yeah it's not available on

00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:17,770
the open web tiles right now the reason

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:20,140
is as I said we are trying or we will

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:22,660
try to make it as simple as possible

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,000
and this is exactly the opposite so

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,700
right now we are thinking how to make it

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,470
in a nice way so it's not that we are

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:35,010
hiding it but if we just put it there

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:41,520
then it will make the whole process more

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:41,520
complicated so stay tuned

00:22:48,550 --> 00:23:08,900
more questions comments okay and hi are

00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:13,190
you using the hip pocket for store them

00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:17,030
up that the vector tiling in information

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:20,090
or you use the for store day the real

00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:23,510
data yes like I don't know the shape

00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:27,070
file or the new JSON data in the new

00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:32,240
package or you would you store the

00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:36,740
vector tile in the hip pocket I don't

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,960
know it is play me well or not yeah I'm

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:43,700
not sure if I got question correctly

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:48,350
like if we use the use your pocket for

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:50,960
serve a vector tiles no no for serving

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:55,070
vector tiles we mostly use MB tiles yeah

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,830
that's like our that's our format which

00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,930
we use most of the time however the

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:03,530
problem with local coordinate system is

00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:05,930
that or the problem with MP tiles is

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:08,090
that it supports on the Mercator and

00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,240
therefore for this specific use case we

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:13,100
switch to your package

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,240
use your package directly like normal

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,240
image yeah yeah

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:34,380
hi okay so my question is with the

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,870
prerendered tiles can be used the

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:45,750
customized styling what is offered on

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:49,830
open my Tyler yes yes it can be used you

00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:52,320
only need to change the weight where

00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:55,410
exactly on the metal cloud or for your

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,030
own yeah yeah there is no problem if you

00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,340
want to use it on a map sauerkraut you

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,810
need to download it then change the

00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,170
source and then upload it again

00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:06,270
is we will work on it so it will be

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:09,780
easier of course easier in the future

00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:15,150
but right now it's workaround because we

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:17,430
want to make it in a nice way and yeah

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:22,920
it takes sometimes to really like think

00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:25,140
about it how to do it properly if I have

00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:30,120
to make a custom style then I have to

00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:33,630
use your application then to custom make

00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:37,500
a custom style no you can you can create

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:41,310
it yourself it's like you can write it

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:44,940
from the scratch you can use some edit

00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:47,750
tools or you can use one of the one

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,750
which are prepared

00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:55,299
