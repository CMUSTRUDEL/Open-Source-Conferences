	00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,730
so welcome everybody to the lightning

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,270
talk session here at Sutton 2019 we have

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:23,750
poor speaker and we'll hear about

00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:29,580
postboxes addresses osm inspector and

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:31,949
about bus lines so we start with SK 53

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,440
and hear about postboxes okay

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,920
my name's Gerry Clough best known as SK

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,750
53 and I'm ostensibly going to talk

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,470
about postboxes but it's really about

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,360
tagging we're here we're here every few

00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,550
weeks or every few months on the mailing

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,220
lists tagging is broken it needs to be

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,110
replaced by a formal model I thought I'd

00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,000
just look at those implications by

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,420
looking at one of the most mundane

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,589
things we map a simple bit of street

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,019
furniture the postbox also happens to be

00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:07,860
a sort of cultural meme in osm that we

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:11,130
mapped post boxes and the first thing to

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,100
say when we look when we say Amina T

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,080
equals closed box we're already modeling

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,360
concepts we're talking about two things

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,350
we're talking about a physical lump of

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,730
metal stuck in a place on the street the

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,410
item of street furniture and we're

00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,180
talking about a service where a postal

00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,870
company comes and takes your the letters

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,030
you put in the post box I won't touch on

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,670
the fact that also many languages the

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,350
word for post box is the same as the

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,440
word we use for the place where the

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,090
Postal Service sent gives you letters

00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:46,110
this post box is interesting because

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,980
it's the only way we map the physical

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,560
post box is when we say it's a disused :

00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,800
and mean a T equals post box like this

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,230
one which also happens to be very

00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,510
interesting because it was attacked by

00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:06,330
suffragettes in about 1911 in a protest

00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:08,099
the votes for women so it turns out post

00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,050
boxes have and there's an interesting

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:13,790
history of post box violence and that

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,790
isn't the first example

00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:21,260
the the main thing the main thing we I

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,879
think the way we are using postboxes is

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,500
as the service and really we know where

00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,930
the postbox is that's the most important

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,810
thing and maybe the collection times are

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,090
useful to add most in most things you

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,640
have a cultural idea of when the post

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,590
comes to collect you know it used to be

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,659
4 o'clock to 6 o'clock in the evening in

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:47,269
Britain but now it's usually 9 o'clock

00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:48,980
in the morning so so the next kind of

00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:50,750
tagging is describing what kind of post

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,329
box and typically we have three kinds of

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:58,340
post boxes and here I've got a Polish

00:02:53,329 --> 00:03:01,400
water lamp box attached to a wall a wall

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:05,930
box which is mounted in the wall so it's

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:11,299
not you only have a plate and a German

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:13,549
pillar box if we look at the post box as

00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:17,030
a whole this is the typical anatomy of a

00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:18,440
British post box and there's a little

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,450
thing here saying when the next

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,510
collection time is which we I don't

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,489
think any more maps where that exists

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,769
there you have below we have the hole

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,299
where you put the letters and I don't

00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,639
know if you know but some letterboxes

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:34,280
post boxes have more than one hole so

00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:39,500
you can say post box apertures equals

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:41,299
two beneath that you have the collection

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,480
plate where but first of all we have all

00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,340
the information which we put into the

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,379
opening times and anyone who's looked at

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,870
the opening to the collector the opening

00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:53,650
times specification understands that

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:57,560
it's a really complex semi formal

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,930
specification with lots of holes and

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,180
then a couple of things which you notice

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,680
on British post boxes beneath that you

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:09,109
will see a crown and beneath that the

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,079
initials of the Queen which is the royal

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:14,840
cypher and beneath that it says

00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,030
post-office and most postal companies

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,549
will have some kind of logo associated a

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:22,430
post box I don't know if it's visible on

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:24,349
this one but also sometimes these are if

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,240
these are made a cast metal they have

00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:26,690
the name of the manufacturer and we can

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,440
tell

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:35,960
postbox on : manufacturer equals so we

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,390
can get a bit more complicated there are

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,540
hundreds of different designs of pillar

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:45,590
boxes so we can save post box : design

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:48,560
equals so and these are I'm afraid of

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,820
very this very UK centric but I'm sure

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,220
you recognize that some of the same

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:59,270
issues existed in other countries royal

00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:01,520
ciphers we have a range of six or all

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,020
ciphers available this is the royal

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,700
cypher of Edward the eighth which

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,090
because he was the King for only eight

00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:12,980
months is very rare and therefore a very

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:14,630
select and dedicated people go and do

00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:23,870
these thing and you can read more about

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:25,850
these on the wiki but queen elizabeth ii

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,280
is only the queen at number two Queen

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,520
Elizabeth in England Wales and Northern

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,270
Ireland she is Queen Elizabeth in

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,450
Scotland

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:38,620
and that was regard is unacceptable to

00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:43,490
the point that people blew up post boxes

00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,980
with a to are on and you can read more

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:50,300
about that on the pillar box boy war

00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:55,490
page on Wikipedia and in a typical

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,830
British compromise and they introduced

00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,840
the Scottish crown which you will notice

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,330
is different from the crown we saw on

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:08,419
the previous one which is the imperial

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:11,270
crown on to the post box is it just a

00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:15,260
British you know here's an Irish post

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:17,030
box with a royal cypher we also have

00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,860
color they come in lots of different

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,860
colors in these are all in Windsor

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,450
we have gold post boxes which are

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,410
associated with Olympians and

00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:32,720
Paralympians we have post boxes which

00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,870
are listed buildings and also telephone

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,910
kiosks and this is the complete range of

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,470
tags on post boxes including the UK on

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:43,430
Rob Whitaker's post husband

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:46,730
oxide if we tried to represent all of

00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,200
that with a formal method we'd be

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,700
talking about orders of magnitude

00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,570
complexity of stuff we could never

00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,340
verify its tagging isn't broke don't fix

00:06:53,570 --> 00:07:30,140
it

00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:30,800
thank you so I click here too okay so my

00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,919
name is ching-he

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,530
I'm French but I've been for in Brazil

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,080
for more than 20 years and I came to

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,370
Britta to to up and hit map with TeleNav

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:45,169
when I was the country manager for

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:47,480
TeleNav in Brazil and when they told me

00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:50,900
hey try to do with to see what you can

00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:54,350
do for the community in Brazil I didn't

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,090
I did do they didn't do much mapping but

00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,919
I started doing what I was used to do is

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:02,090
to get in contact with people and that

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:05,000
was in 2014-2015 so I managed to have I

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:08,140
had I've had quite many meetings with

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,370
many different people in Brazil

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,200
particularly in governments the

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,930
government's even published an official

00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,780
notes recommending the use of

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:21,229
OpenStreetMap to Brazilian governments

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:24,560
in general and among all these contacts

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:25,970
that I've had I always speak in my

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,680
presentation at one moment I always

00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,919
speak about really who is also from

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:35,719
Brazil but who is developed the new SME

00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:38,419
shop and in 2014 I saw this presentation

00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,159
from Christian quest who is not here

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,469
anymore today because he left yesterday

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,570
was with us and I was very much

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:49,670
impressed by what he managed to do in

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:52,550
France and he said to the Ministry of

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,900
to the Ministry of Finance hey we

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,400
OpenStreetMap have got a set of

00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,670
addresses you've got another one which

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,310
is very good nasty to geography Nacional

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,380
has got another one and the post office

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,970
has got four different ones and many

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,800
people are sending addresses here in

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,760
France why don't we put all our efforts

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:14,060
together in one place and after a while

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,270
in fact he managed to he managed to do

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,400
that because if there was a very

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,550
interesting fights a kind of a fight or

00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,350
a problem because between the IGN in

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,110
this project because his project was

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,030
kind of an open project and finally it

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,980
seems that the First Minister created

00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm not having to censure this story but

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,710
the First Minister created little AB

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,570
which were which is we still is which is

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:42,470
still an entity that works for

00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,270
digitalization of the government in

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,970
France and they invited him to

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,250
coordinate this project from inside from

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,010
the government side and I found it very

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,050
interesting so there is a website that

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:57,530
exists in France which is at rest that

00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:01,100
data.gov dot if FR and they are working

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:03,950
on congregating and bringing together

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,680
all these different data sets of

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:10,460
addresses focused on our addresses from

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,940
municipalities utility players etc and

00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,890
it's a project which is going on

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,830
reasonably well although Christian quest

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,970
and I just left it recently but there is

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,130
someone that there are some other people

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,230
there taking care of the project and

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:28,310
it's a very cheap project such it's a

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:30,020
project that could be done with about

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,990
two or three people and that's all

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:38,540
because it basically it's a database and

00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:41,690
where you need to invite people to to

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,610
communicate and to give data etc so I've

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,550
tried to do that in Brazil and I'm

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,980
proposing with all these meetings among

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,920
these pictures that I've shown before of

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,980
meetings that I had I had meetings with

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,870
people from the digital secretary of the

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,410
digital government in Brazil with the

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:02,769
IBGE which is the the

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:05,889
the entity that is doing geography and

00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:08,829
maps in Brazil I've spoken with the

00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:11,979
Brazilian association of logistics

00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:16,659
etcetera and what I'm explaining to them

00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:19,599
is that Brazil has got no address or no

00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:22,209
good set of addresses in in

00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:24,099
OpenStreetMap the best player is

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:27,220
probably googled today after here and

00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:29,139
TomTom but geocoding in Brazil is very

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,329
is an actual challenge when you get out

00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:33,849
of the big towns and it's an enormous

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:37,089
opportunity for the country to improve

00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:38,529
its logistics and I tell them hey every

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:42,549
time I speak with someone who has got

00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:45,849
for example a fleet how many want a

00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:48,279
fleet for example how in how much would

00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:50,229
you improve your your your your

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,119
logistics and your operation if you had

00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:54,729
a good set of addresses and the guys say

00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:56,769
well I don't know at this 5% and it

00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:59,049
happens that Brazil spends something

00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:03,669
like 12% substitutes gross national

00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:07,119
product in on logistics so the potential

00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:10,209
of having just a database is enormous in

00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:13,689
terms of improvement of the of the

00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:16,299
functioning of the country so I'm trying

00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:18,249
to evolve and and it seems to me that as

00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:20,919
I've worked on this and the last month

00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:24,279
more more precisely it seems to me them

00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:26,199
about to manage to do it and I think

00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,999
that it's very interesting for as a

00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,309
conclusion I think this project in

00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:32,229
France is amazingly interesting it's

00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:33,879
very interesting if we manage to do it

00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:35,679
in Brazil and I think it would be very

00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,739
interesting to know event or eventually

00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,139
other places in the world interesting

00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:42,249
trying to work on that or where people

00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:44,409
would have already done that

00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:45,909
so I'm interested in instead of only

00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:48,459
speaking about France to speak

00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:50,289
eventually over other places was where

00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:54,089
similar things things have been done

00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:54,089
okay so thank you very much

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:06,130
so next person is Makana Miculek I shot

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:09,360
and he will tell us news about osm

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,360
inspector let's see

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:27,019
put away this google at attention please

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:29,269
ladies yours mechana hello i'm i'm

00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:31,700
nikana from sheer fabric i am currently

00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:34,610
the main developer of our web inspector

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,399
and i would like to show you some news

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:41,060
about a stream of inspector in the last

00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,010
couple of months we if we Whitten the

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,079
routing few the ordering field was

00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,980
previously based of a couple of backend

00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,709
programs

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:52,100
it used over sir m to detect routing

00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:54,410
island sinks and sources and a java

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,990
program by pascal nice to find

00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:01,579
unconnected nodes if we wit in this part

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,959
and now use quaffable based software to

00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:05,450
find unconnected nodes

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:09,680
routing islands and applicated edges

00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:13,279
this is Heidelberg it looks quite pet

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,899
but a lots of the mouth for supplicates

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,950
and i would like to show you some of the

00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:21,649
layers as a first step there is the

00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:25,459
group duplicated edges to duplicate i

00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:29,089
just group con distinguishes between

00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:32,390
real duplicated edges and those which

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:36,350
are just for likely false positives near

00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:40,220
pedestrian areas let's have a look at

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,720
this one click on it and then you have a

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,110
pattern where you can open it in

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,110
Trussell

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:52,410
and let's have a look it seems that our

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,990
two at two ways above each other and I

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:59,579
can have a look at the differences and

00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:02,370
it seems that someone has 12 on the way

00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:04,709
above the other one so the solution

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,889
would usually be to delete to delete one

00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:10,199
of them sometimes this is an accident of

00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:13,529
splitting ways so that would be the

00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:17,550
solution and it looks fine let's have a

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:20,579
look at the next layer group islands

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:23,250
islands are locations and on the

00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:26,310
autograph which are not connected to the

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,620
rest of the graph while drinking engines

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:33,209
are usually able to eliminate them

00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:36,509
before they join the processing but they

00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:39,360
are usually a sign of somehow broken

00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:43,230
data for example let's have a look at

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,540
this one it's black this means that this

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,939
is an outing island for all vehicles not

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,189
only cars and bicycles the car and

00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:53,100
bicycle layers take excess restrictions

00:15:50,189 --> 00:16:00,839
into account while all vehicle layers

00:15:53,100 --> 00:16:03,180
layer doesn't this is which over a vote

00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,939
and it's not connected anywhere and it's

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:09,300
in private way the best solution would

00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:12,899
be to visit the location and try to

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,540
connect it to the road network that's

00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:19,769
something you can't usually to us aerial

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:25,399
imagery only miss earth who both layers

00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:27,779
are unconnected notes the column means

00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,059
dakara is an indicator of the importance

00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:34,019
of the error what is will a real issue

00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:36,689
why blue is often a false positive this

00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:39,449
ranking takes the distance into account

00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:42,149
and it takes into account whether there

00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:45,019
are texts like no exit equals yes or

00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:48,870
entrance equals yes at the end note and

00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:54,410
it will discard all unconnected ends

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:57,990
well the next way is beyond a fence or

00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:59,880
embankment of all which you cannot pass

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:06,630
for example this ello he

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:09,720
is of medium priority and it's a left

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,939
over of incomplete sidewalk mapping it's

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,650
likely that these sidewalks are should

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,679
be connected to the router or just

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:22,140
ending here and the best solution would

00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:36,809
be to press a and connect them thank you

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:40,409
for your attention so we are talking

00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:52,020
about quickly mapping bus lines and how

00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:54,210
it works with counting tools can you

00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,220
hear me now yes so I'm sorry my

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,679
handwriting is terrible it's with

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,400
routing tools

00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,830
yeah well would you count and I realize

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,330
I'm the last one standing between us and

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:12,350
lunch so I'll be very quick hopefully we

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,350
can still get something today

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:19,669
and how'd you do this a view and

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,649
[Music]

00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:27,149
full-screen mode that looks good

00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:30,570
so I've I've mapped a couple of best

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:32,669
lines with the PT v2 schema for those

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,190
who've done it it takes a long time you

00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:39,120
have to put every way in the thing and

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:43,860
it breaks often people create gaps and

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,429
by mistake and so it's a fragile complex

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,309
schema

00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:50,399
all right I've done is I put a tool that

00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:53,010
where you copy/paste from a relation you

00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:54,809
put all the stop positions of a line you

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:59,159
just have to gather those in the right

00:18:54,809 --> 00:19:04,770
order and then you click on that on that

00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:07,770
button and it opens up Oh SRM where the

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:10,230
bus profile so it does all the all the

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,080
way that the bus would take if there's a

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:15,390
mistake you could grab the line and drag

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,929
it along to the to where the bus is

00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:20,940
supposed to run and it also lets you

00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:23,070
know where it also lets you detect when

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,850
that when the tagging or like a one-way

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:30,720
bus is is missing so you can improve it

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:32,580
or SM and then for those who have very

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,740
good eyes you see at the bottom left but

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,169
i I've I've zoomed in for you I've

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:41,909
created a button that says create

00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:43,080
relation in Jassim and when you do that

00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:46,230
in the background

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,929
it takes so oh s RM doesn't return away

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:53,190
ideas but it returns nodes so it takes

00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:56,460
all those nodes IDs and then it using

00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:59,429
the matte box routes annotator it gets

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,130
the way IDs from that so if you're going

00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:04,350
through node 1 2 3 and 2 3 4 you must be

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,559
going through that way and it takes all

00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,570
of those ways and tells Jotham to fetch

00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:12,350
them from overpass and to create a

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:17,100
relation containing all those ways and

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:18,840
you get this which is in a few minutes

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,640
you've made a whole bus relation

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,279
containing all the ways that the bus is

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,960
going to go through it's not perfect

00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,320
I've taken a screenshot showing how it's

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,139
not

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,440
it has a gap at the bottom but then you

00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:33,990
would just use the PTO system tools to

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,610
fix the gaps half automatically or you'd

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,980
fix it manually because it doesn't take

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:41,360
a lot of time and you would add the

00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:44,490
tagging and you would paste the stops

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:48,419
into that relation and that's it you

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:51,899
have your PT v2 route and while I was

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:56,220
doing that I thought you know why are we

00:20:51,899 --> 00:21:01,080
even entering though all the ways into

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:07,379
OSM because what we can define a bus

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:09,059
route as is stops and also the via

00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:10,830
points that sometimes you would have to

00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,769
take the special cases but most of the

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:16,830
time the stops are enough so I'm

00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:18,929
thinking of making a proposal and this

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,980
is to get everyone screaming at me no

00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:27,950
this is not a good idea of redefining

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:31,799
bus lines as just the stops and violence

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:33,960
next step are also with this matching I
