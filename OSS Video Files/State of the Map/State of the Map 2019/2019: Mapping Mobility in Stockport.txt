Title: 2019: Mapping Mobility in Stockport
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2019
Description: 
	In early 2019, Open Data Manchester teamed up with Stockport council, Disability Stockport 
and Age UK Stockport to crowdsource data around mobility and accessibility in the town centre. This talk will cover the mapping methodology, findings, difficulties and solutions, as well as suggesting ways in which we can better map for these communities, making the data collected for OSM more inclusive and accessible for all.

In early 2019, Open Data Manchester partnered with Stockport Council on a project called ‘Mapping Mobility Stockport’, funded through the ODI Geospatial Fund. Working with Age UK and Disability Stockport, the project crowdsourced data about accessibility issues in Stockport, drawing on the lived experiences of people with mobility impairments to supplement data already available to the council.

The municipal environment often includes barriers that exclude people with restricted mobility. These barriers may be the result of natural topography, historic planning, deterioration of the urban environment or planned and unplanned maintenance. Some of the barriers may not be known to the local authority. 

People with mobility impairments are on the frontline when it comes to negotiating these obstacles, and often have their own knowledge and strategies in negotiating and circumventing them. This is a resource that could be invaluable in helping others who face similar challenges, as well as helping local authorities identify where interventions need to be made.

One of the aims of Mapping Mobility Stockport was to begin to map and find ways to continue to share these strategies.

Using our Joy Diversion format as a basis, Open Data Manchester co-designed and ran a series of workshops with Age UK and Disability Stockport, which brought together different techniques and mobility strategies contained within the local community to enable people of all abilities to explore and map their environment.

We used large, hi-resolution maps of Stockport to scribble on and sketch out routes, before taking to the streets to document, photograph and map the kind of things that these communities come up against on a daily basis. This information was then added to Stockport Council’s mapping system and Open Street Map, helping create a mobility map of Stockport.

This talk will explore how we collected this data, sharing some of the findings and insights from the project, such as how what is useful for one disability can be problematic for another (such as tactile paving, which is useful for those with visual impairments but can be problematic for a wheelchair user). The talk will also explore the difficulties that arose out of this when categorising and tagging these features, and question whether more needs to be done in terms of mapping the streets and sidewalk.

my name is Sam I'm from open data in

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,889
Manchester

00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm going to talk to you today about a

00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:18,170
project that we did in Stockport

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,950
and hopefully give you some experiences

00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:25,930
that I hope the OSM community will

00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:28,790
benefit from hearing about so firstly

00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:31,609
what is math open data Manchester who

00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:34,129
are we so open data Manchester was

00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:36,920
established in 2010 actually one of the

00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:40,460
earliest sort of open data organizations

00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,129
in the UK at least and our mission is to

00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,739
promote a fairer and more equitable

00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:47,870
society through the development of

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:50,450
intelligent and responsible data

00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:53,030
practice across Greater Manchester but

00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:56,719
also nationally and internationally and

00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:59,469
so we advocate for local and national

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,379
government data release we run workshops

00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:05,750
training events research we develop

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:08,869
initiatives looking at working with data

00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,869
but we also promote organizations doing

00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,630
good work with data we're a small

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,940
organization but we have a really wide

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,840
community base with a diverse set of

00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:23,360
knowledge and skills so we do a lot of

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,549
work around data standards such as the

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,890
open contracting data standard you might

00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:31,009
heard about the 360 giving data standard

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:33,140
we look at data governance rights and

00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,850
we're developing a declaration for

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,610
responsible and intelligent data

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,170
practice but we're also interested in

00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,350
the Internet of Things we run the things

00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,049
north network in in the UK but we also

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:48,350
run a lot of monthly meetups occasional

00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:51,409
hackathons dig in the data that kind of

00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,240
thing and also our joy diversion meetups

00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:55,909
which I'll share a little bit about in a

00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,610
minute so we do a wide wide range of

00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:01,780
things so with mapping mobility

00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:04,850
Stockport we ain't to map the

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,830
experiences of those with mobility or

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,320
accessibility impairments look

00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,330
the roots and the strategies that they

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,000
used to move in and out of Stockport

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,770
Town Center the obstacles they came

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,050
across the barriers would also the

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,600
things that worked well as well

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,060
the project was code designed with local

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,850
charity disability Stockport and Age UK

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,130
Stockport and was led by open data

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,380
Manchester with Stockport Council as

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,620
well with funding from the open data

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,820
Institute I'm going to talk about sort

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,010
of what we did what we found and

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,120
basically you know the need to sort of

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:48,810
ensure that we have more inclusive

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,600
methodology in our mapping so this is a

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:55,620
painting by LS Lowry some of you might

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,590
know him he is a northern painter from

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,360
northern the UK because you can see this

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,550
isn't actually stock pop and it's nearby

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,890
you can see but there's like lots of

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,750
steps nice clean lines everything looks

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,480
really nice and easy but if you've ever

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,720
been to Stockport it's a little bit more

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,880
like this it's quite confusing at first

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,370
there's lots of layers I mean this is

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,590
actually me experimenting with a 360

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,519
camera but I thought it gave a really

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:26,010
good sense of one's experience stop on

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,300
Town Centre at times but a more serious

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:33,000
example this is this circle road here is

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,130
called Market Place and it is next to

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,860
the market place so it's quite a busy

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,840
area but this is what it really looks

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,030
like so it's not actually a straight

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,580
line there's lots of data points there

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:48,600
potentially but yet obviously it's

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:51,720
mapped as a single line the point is the

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,550
urban environment it often includes lots

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,610
of barriers like the ones you can see

00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,530
here that exclude people with restricted

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,860
mobility so that might be because of the

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,560
topography you know historical planning

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,989
just deterioration of the urban

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,299
environment and some of these things

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:11,400
might not actually be known to the local

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,910
authority now as I say this is not

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,010
unusual particularly for Stockport which

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,340
is built over various levels

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:26,160
steep inclines lots of stairs it's not

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:28,080
the most accessible Town Center so as I

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,580
say people with mobility impairments

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,990
particularly in Stockport they are at

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,240
the front line when it comes to

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,220
negotiating these obstacles but they

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,780
often have their own routes that they

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,580
take they often have their own

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,740
strategies that they use to get around

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,710
the town center and most of this

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,810
information isn't shared it's contains

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,270
Bob tacitly within the communities

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,130
themselves it could be for a variety of

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,380
reasons particularly with the groups

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,200
that I worked with they're not they

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,750
might use things like Google Maps thing

00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,060
most of them probably haven't heard of

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,290
Open Street Map before so this kind of

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,850
thing perhaps might not get picked up

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,710
but this information the routes the

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,810
strategies the ways they move into and

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,310
out of the town centre it could be a

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,440
resource that could be really invaluable

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,180
in helping others who face similar

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,690
challenges particularly if you're

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,510
visiting the town as well as helping

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,730
local authorities identify where

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,470
interventions need to be made or in the

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,330
case of Stockport they re developing

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,120
their town centre so we were able to

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,160
feed directly into that so as I say we

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,660
worked with disability stop all Asia UK

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,570
support we designed a series of

00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,850
workshops and I guess mapping parties is

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,430
kind of what we did and which drew

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,940
directly on their lived experience of

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:47,850
the town centre so workshops were sort

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,980
of based around the joint aversion

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,630
meetups that opendata Manchester

00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,560
regularly runs throughout the year if

00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,780
you were at the OSM OpenStreetMap UK AGM

00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,640
last year and as some of you here were

00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,590
you you'll be familiar with joy

00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,710
diversion in a joy diversion

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,890
participants we take maps of Manchester

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,170
and Salford from the 1800s

00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:12,650
and people look at what's changed look

00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:15,570
at what's interesting they propose

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,040
expeditions form teams and they

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,720
basically just go out and see what they

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,100
can find they might do a bit of mapping

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,490
or they might just go and explore the

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,130
city it's primarily it's a fun meetup

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,210
it's designed for the whole family but

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,689
it is also about helping people

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,429
recognize and claim

00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:33,099
ownership of their city you know the

00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:35,110
streets are theirs but the format

00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:40,089
provided a really good starting point

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:43,329
for the map and mobility project so we

00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:46,119
designed two types or streams of

00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:48,399
workshops which were designed to account

00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:53,079
for the different needs and requirements

00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:55,619
of the project participants the first

00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:59,169
type of workshop consisted entirely of

00:06:55,619 --> 00:07:01,689
indoor sessions we made use of high

00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:04,479
resolution printed maps provided by

00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:06,009
Stockport Council you can earn assim see

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,679
him there

00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:10,929
we began basically by discussing areas

00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:13,079
and generating a list of obstructions

00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:18,579
and issues and beginning to identify

00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:20,949
particular areas of notes so yeah so

00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:22,959
this is the large high resolution

00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:25,179
provided by the council we invited

00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:28,629
people literally to scribble onto the

00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:30,729
map so remember that many of these only

00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:32,829
might have only really used things like

00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:35,709
Google for search they might not be

00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:37,719
digital at all so this information was

00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:40,629
directly then fed to Stockport Council

00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:45,069
and all relevant information into Open

00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:47,379
Street Map as well here's an example of

00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,509
one of the workshops in action this is a

00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:51,819
UK Stockport's as you can see it was

00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:54,069
generating a lot of discussion and these

00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:56,439
discussions naturally led into you a

00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:59,050
deeper dive into the problem areas

00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,869
themselves participants began to share

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,719
their experiences in much more detail

00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:07,569
and describe routes that they take on a

00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:11,309
regular basis this is a session from

00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:14,319
disability Stockport we had a variety of

00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:16,479
disabilities who have wheelchairs of

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,699
multiple levels of blindness and one

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,559
gentleman would quite acute neurological

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,319
problem as where he's fine unless he's

00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:26,489
going downhill so we were really started

00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,869
to draw on some you know various

00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:32,800
mobility impairments beyond just sort of

00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:35,559
wheelchairs so this is an example of yet

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,479
of another workshop but which led into

00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,079
the second

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,579
workshop which was outdoor expeditions

00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:43,550
with the workshop participants and it

00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:46,350
was from these that we got the most

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:48,779
information so we went out with people

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,639
one on one or in small groups and we had

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,079
digital recorders taking lots of

00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,360
photographs and we asked the

00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:56,699
participants to take the routes that

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,800
they normally take to travel on us or

00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:00,750
daily or weekly basis and they we just

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,699
got them to narrate their experience in

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,279
sort of first-person to literally tell

00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:08,459
us what was going on now trips were

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,199
weather dependent due to the time and

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,779
scope of the project we had to do this

00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:14,730
between January and March I don't know

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,410
if you know Manchester or support in

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,510
January or March there was a lot of rain

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,790
there was a lot of snow so we perhaps

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,680
didn't get to go out as much as we would

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,170
like so this is where we fell back onto

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,510
the first type of workshop so we would

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,910
get the routes and I would go out in my

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,470
cold taking photos and taking pictures

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,480
like that and then bringing them back

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:37,320
for further discussion but we did try to

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,880
go out as much as we possibly could yeah

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,380
I mean the main great thing about the

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,269
outdoor expeditions is that they were

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,730
able to convey their experience of

00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:47,579
accessing Stockport and as I said we've

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,949
got a broad range of impairments from

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:55,380
physical neurological visual that kind

00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:57,060
of thing so what did we find so yeah we

00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,010
gained some I mean personal needs some

00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,779
incredibly and valuable insights which I

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,389
want to sort share there's the obvious

00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:05,130
things dropped curbs that kind of thing

00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:07,529
in front of driveways people in

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,440
OpenStreetMap who be very familiar with

00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:13,350
this kind of thing

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,639
things like steps into shops or you know

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,949
these were the standard things we

00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,529
expected to find this is one of my

00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:21,870
favorites this is a dropped curb of

00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:24,660
tactile paving leading to a raised curb

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:29,089
with no tactile paving on a really busy

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,089
bus route into the town centre okay so

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:35,430
luckily this is part of the the bus is

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,990
the area is being redeveloped and I can

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,910
confirm that Stockport Council are going

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,560
to be sorting this out so it was a

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,710
really positive outcome for the project

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,270
there but just things I did I didn't

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,430
realize maybe some of you might not

00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,770
realize like different in the UK we have

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,530
different colored tactile paving for

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,300
different things so the red is where

00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,220
there is a controlled crossing so you

00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,590
press a button and the yellow is where

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,360
there is no controlled crossing so that

00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:03,480
is obviously really useful but in some

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,430
areas of heritage they use grey and if

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,550
you are partially sighted grey is a very

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:12,810
difficult difficult color to sort of to

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:15,050
work with particularly interesting point

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,430
relating to the use of tactile paving

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,170
whilst useful for those with visual

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,770
impairments they can actually become a

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:25,230
hazard for a wheelchair user so

00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,810
essentially the the chairs front wheels

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,970
the little jockeys can become caught on

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:33,000
the bumps and cause the person to be

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,790
thrown from their chair so John who is a

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,830
very very able-bodied very able person

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,780
regularly comes out of his wheelchair

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:43,020
because of tactile paving

00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,820
so and in areas like this where tactile

00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,160
paving stretches the width of the

00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,930
pavement it's meant to guide the person

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,730
with visual impairment to the crossing

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,040
becomes even more difficult for a

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,750
wheelchair user so it's what's really

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,480
interesting that is you know what is

00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,940
assistive for one person becomes an

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,750
obstacle for another and I think that's

00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,430
a really really important thing to note

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,340
it also raises lots of questions around

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,830
things like this so areas of bad paving

00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:13,890
or broken paving so obviously we use in

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,170
the UK things like fix my Street I don't

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:18,150
know if that's outside the UK or not but

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,460
this is an area that has a river running

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,830
underneath it so while the paving is

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,440
will be fixed it's an area that

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,510
regularly has problems so there was a

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,760
whole question about how all do you map

00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:32,340
should that you don't you can't map each

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,590
individual broken paving but the area

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,320
itself perhaps can be flagged in some

00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,940
way and what about this so this looks

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,830
fine at the moment but

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,330
summer that's loads of brambles that

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,570
whole paving will be covered with

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:48,780
brambles so suddenly that becomes

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,070
problematic and this is just an example

00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,470
of the high street that is used

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:55,290
regularly you can see Bullards a boards

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,570
taking up pavement space you know could

00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,040
this be how would you look at that bolas

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,350
and lampposts you know ask something

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,850
more permanent here's another view you

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,920
can actually see a mobility scooter in

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,980
the background and zipping down a very

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,720
busy road because he can't use the

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,270
pavement in fact Stockport Council

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,910
requires all shops to register their

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,860
Able's so they're supposed to be

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,920
supposed to be in line with bollards so

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,100
we know that this is an area of ongoing

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,720
potentially limited accessibility this

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,360
is a just around the corner from

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,160
disability Stockport's building so as

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,170
you can see there's not really an

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,820
accessible drop curb no tactile paving

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:37,200
this is on the other side so that's the

00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,330
other side of the street so you can all

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,250
see how that's problematic but how do we

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,130
map this do we map this what kind of

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:47,400
factors do we need to take into account

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:49,980
so this is what we kind of collected

00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,410
this is what Stockport Council put

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,000
together so this is all the information

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,560
that we collected within the scope of

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,300
the project so you can start to see

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,180
hotspots along with that captured

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,250
information we can this has been really

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,100
useful for Stockport Council in planning

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,650
their Town Center redevelopment and the

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,480
documentation is potentially useful for

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,900
those who want to use it but perhaps not

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,550
the most accessible really unfortunately

00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:18,510
this will destroy as the scope of our

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:20,280
project got but it for me it opened up a

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,870
much wider question which is something

00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,780
that I think there's a lot of discussion

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,610
today about which is can we make can we

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,650
make our Maps and routing out some more

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,990
inclusive and how so obviously when

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:33,330
planning to get from A to B Maps tend to

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,010
give us the fastest or most efficient

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,230
route but they don't often take into

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:40,410
account the wide variety of mobility and

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,420
accessibility needs so whilst there is

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,210
plenty of information there's lots of

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,670
maps and apps that can help guide people

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,920
around public buildings or trans

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:51,620
systems such as wheelmap or sociability

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,090
a lot of these celebrate on the

00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,120
assumption that people with

00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:57,920
accessibility needs just sort of catch

00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,990
and get to those locations in the first

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,700
place and with the case of will map but

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,060
there's certainly not a lot of data in

00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:08,600
the UK on will map this is a quote from

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:11,060
Pete who has total blindness and he has

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,950
is his it's one of the best arguments

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,350
I've seen from up in the pavement so to

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,360
to most people the road is the same

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,010
whichever way you're going but for me

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,570
each side of the pavement is a

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:25,940
completely different terrain to learn I

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:28,610
thought that was that was really really

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,800
powerful observation there are some

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,810
examples in the UK at least of how it's

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,120
being done this is a map of Easley that

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,000
gives users an accessible route from the

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,670
train station to the town centre this is

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,770
a community built map of Hebden Bridge

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,720
you can see it's cut they've color-coded

00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,000
the sidewalk so you can get a sense of

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,030
how easy or difficult certain terrains

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,400
may be like why is this crowd-sourced

00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:55,250
map of Casa Fiorentina in Tuscany as

00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,900
detailed color-coded system for

00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,370
navigating the most accessible routes

00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,010
through the area but but these are

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,870
printed Maps not much use in terms of

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,780
sharing data you know and obviously if

00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,850
you can't actually see or read what

00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,860
about digital routing software we are

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,330
starting to see a growth of awareness in

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,580
the need to provide accessibility

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,260
options which is great but whilst this

00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,170
haven't yet made it to you perhaps the

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:21,650
most commonly used routing and mapping

00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:24,620
apps yet there are ventures like project

00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:27,050
sidewalk or access map I think there

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,610
these are some quite good examples I've

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,020
seen that I think of beginning to tip

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,890
the balance although coverages and

00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:35,660
widespread and at present but it's also

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,660
important to point out that these focus

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,790
on mobility and accessibility mostly

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:45,800
just wheelchair or scooters and not

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,660
other ones as well so open route service

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,890
I think was discussed just now shows

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,930
promise incorporates different

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,520
wheelchair profiles allowing you to make

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,650
adjustments for your route preferences

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,120
but at present only caters for those in

00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,410
wheelchairs and scooters and I've not

00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,940
actually been able to get this to work

00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,130
because as I think the gentleman said

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,490
that

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:04,230
data is quite sparse okay so there needs

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,690
to be a greater awareness of the needs

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,630
of map mobility and accessibility in a

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:12,240
more detailed way width of road inclined

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,680
camber things like bullard street signs

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,020
in the middle of the pavement these are

00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,839
permanent fixtures fixtures that could

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,000
be mapped and in my opinion maybe it

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,010
maybe should be you know no different to

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,910
say drop curbs and just in tactile

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:30,030
paving at the same time if we're an

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,920
able-bodied person like myself we cannot

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,680
presume to know what to look for and

00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,900
what to map right you know working to a

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,570
consensus in a sort of Wikipedia style

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,800
is really good but is not the same as

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:45,360
equality is not the same as inclusion

00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,700
you know with any consensus based system

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,160
how do we make sure the voices of the

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,430
marginalized are heard and included it

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,070
needs to be part of the design if you

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:58,100
get it wrong from the start then the

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,690
systems itself may not be able to

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,100
describe the experiences you want to

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,170
describe and I think that's really

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,820
really important I think with the

00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:10,110
mapping mobility project it was a good

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,390
pilot for a methodology that quickly and

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,690
inclusively crowd-sourced a lot of dates

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,160
are on a very localized level and I

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,170
think that the OpenStreetMap community

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,210
is you know potentially in the best

00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,490
position to push this to push this in

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,920
the right direction after all you know

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,140
look how quickly it created what the the

00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,990
most detailed crowdsource map of the

00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:33,210
world with this extremely flexible

00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,250
tagging system there's absolutely no

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,260
reason that some standards could be

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,050
developed for all manner of disabilities

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,880
and needs but just hammer the point home

00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:46,530
we have to be careful when presuming to

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,300
map for people and not not you know not

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,580
with them or by them unless we are

00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,680
helping those communities to map for

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,350
themselves you know mapping with them

00:18:52,680 --> 00:19:01,770
then we risk creating more biases yeah

00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:03,060
we regardless of our intentions so just

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,410
some sort of next set of policy we need

00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,990
to do need to think about how we

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:09,940
describe different mobility impairments

00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,799
different experiences and this does need

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,899
to be led I think from the communities

00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,669
themselves we're not just talking about

00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:17,350
wheelchair users we're talking visual

00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:19,029
impairments acute neurological

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:22,059
impairments each with their own unique

00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:23,950
abilities and disabilities and what

00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:26,110
we've seen is that you know what works

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,230
one person might not work for another

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:32,440
person ideally we want these communities

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:34,149
to be mapping for themselves with the

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,840
groups we work with they simply don't

00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:39,580
use programs such as OS n so they need

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,889
to be provision for training that kind

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,289
of thing we're King and opened it in

00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,879
Manchester to continue this project all

00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:48,639
of our stuff is in the open it's on our

00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:50,769
on us on our github you can download

00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:52,659
what we didn't you're a methodology and

00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:54,879
do it yourself and if it's something

00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,289
that you want to replicate and try out

00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:58,480
in your community or you have

00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:02,190
suggestions then we'd love to talk to

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,720
you I'm around for the rest of the day

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,690
yeah I think that's it so thank you very

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,859
much

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,859
[Applause]

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:17,620
thank you Sam for this interesting

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,620
presentation do we have questions

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:41,200
I often find that anything that isn't a

00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:44,970
nuisance for me personally is not

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:48,429
something I have the confidence to

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:51,730
support on - Matt how would I how could

00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:55,330
I addressed that that's a really good

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:58,539
question and I think I think part of it

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:01,570
is including the person for people who

00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:03,429
might find that an obstacle you know as

00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,990
I say we can't all there are certain

00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,630
things that we know are there like the

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,950
drop curbs tactile paving of things that

00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,140
can be mapped but I think you're right

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,580
you're not entirely sure if you should

00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,549
map it because it might be an obstacle

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,350
or a nuisance then perhaps you know one

00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:18,940
element is to sort of not map it but

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,740
then the other one is maybe go and talk

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,630
to your local charity or a local

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:26,700
community group but who might be

00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,700
interested in that sort of thing

00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:37,740
I'm assuming them part of your problem

00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,149
of moving on is about getting funding to

00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:45,740
do carry on projects like this is there

00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:48,330
any interest with government yeah that's

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:51,179
absolutely right I mean we're I'm

00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:53,970
looking for ways to continue this in

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:56,039
Stockport there is another council in

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,269
Greater Manchester I'm not going to say

00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,009
their name - I don't want to drop the

00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:00,809
minute in case they pull out but who are

00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:03,539
also who are interested in the project

00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:06,240
they were interested in mapping sound

00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:08,519
auditory levels on certain streets or

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,230
people perhaps on autistic spectrum who

00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,909
are affected by different sound levels

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:15,690
so we've actually been talking to them

00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:20,580
so there is ways we're looking but yeah

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:22,200
I hope it gets used again where someone

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:27,119
else is it's really important that stuff

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:29,509
you doing thank you yeah thanks a lot of

00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,509
questions

00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,800
I think this free presentation is really

00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,080
inspiring and yeah great to see the work

00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,490
that's going on up in Manchester I was

00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,370
wondering you mentioned earlier on that

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,770
most people you were working with hadn't

00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:51,150
necessarily heard of osm and tended to

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,670
use things like Google Maps or Apple

00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,780
maps is there a way for this data that

00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,470
you're collecting to find its way back

00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:01,020
into those products to find them find

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:03,090
this information over an integral and so

00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,980
on just a good question and that's not

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,110
something that uh that we've looked at

00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,750
at this point I think we've been mostly

00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,240
focusing on Open Street Map you have a

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,070
stream map community haven't looked at

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,870
any of the wider ones I mean you know

00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:19,230
you do tend to find that things that end

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:21,600
up in OpenStreetMap do turn up in Google

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,520
and Bing and so I think part of it is

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,040
because we covered it from a very

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,020
community grassroots level it feels to

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,600
me like that's the best position to the

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,700
OS 7 community is the best one and I

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,010
think that's where the push can really

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,140
come from actually if just and we are

00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,770
starting to see it as the previous talk

00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,720
you know there is more of an interest in

00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,730
accessibility mapping accessibility

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,890
providing accessibility routing I think

00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,960
that you know all the best ideas get

00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,820
stolen right so if the open stream that

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,290
community is continues to do it in such

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,150
a great way I think it wouldn't be long

00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:57,540
before we start to see it in another

00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:59,460
more mainstream perhaps the more common

00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:06,110
maps and apps if I can call them that

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:06,110
yeah we have time for one more question

00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,210
if that's not the case let's thank them

00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,930
again for making the world more

00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,930
accessible

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,420
