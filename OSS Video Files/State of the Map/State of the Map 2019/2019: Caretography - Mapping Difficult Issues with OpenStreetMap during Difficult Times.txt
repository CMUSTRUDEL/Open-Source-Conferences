Title: 2019: Caretography - Mapping Difficult Issues with OpenStreetMap during Difficult Times
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2019
Description: 
	We map because we care to represent the world. Yet maps are never "true", they are shaped by their creators and their circumstances. Map-making is world-making: maps by different authors can give access to different worlds. So how can we make, share, and use maps that are created _by_ these worlds, and not just by a privileged few? How can vulnerable communities influence how they’re represented and affected by our maps?

The popular view is that mapping the world is just an act of reflecting reality and reflecting nature. People rely on map-makers like us to show them the “true” spatial arrangement of the world. And yet, making a map also involves making assumptions, omissions, additions, and generalisations, and it feeds on our training, experiences, and personal perspectives as map-makers. A map is never really “true”, it is shaped by the hands of its creators, and it is always also a product of chance and its circumstances of making, sharing, and use. It can be said that map-making is world-making: maps shape our understanding of the world, and inform our actions in the world, and a map by a different author can give access to a different world. So how do we create a map of the world that is created _by_ the world, and not just by a privileged few?

To fully appreciate the complexity of this challenge we need to extend our understanding of what counts as maps and mapping, and why. In order to understand our responsibility as map-makers, we need to become both _critical_ and _caring_ cartographers. This shift in perspectives and attitudes can help us understand better what can happen when our everyday mapping practice connects with real-world circumstances. It may also help us become more responsible as the volunteer workers of OSM.

David and Martin will guide you through a careful and caring consideration of OSM based on personal experiences, and talk about the responsibilities we carry as we map and make the world during difficult times.

For example, we may encounter circumstances where the OpenStreetMap approach to openness brings complications. Can the communities represented on the platform make decisions about how they’re being written about? Indigenous communities around the world regard their land as sacred and don’t want it to be mapped. Should we as a global community know when not to map? There are circumstances where the act of mapping itself can bring danger to the mapper. Do we have the right methods to assess such risks? What support can we offer those who take them? If we don’t, whose hand gets to shape the map instead? And what does all of this this mean for a do-ocracy, where decisions emerge slowly and can often contradict each other? Or to put it even more broadly, how can we diversify, democratise, denaturalise, and decolonise open mapping?

Who cares, you ask? David and Martin have participated in the OSM ecosystem as mappers, researchers, and organisers, and have been involved in the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and other global mapping initiatives. Based on their personal experiences they will introduce you to a careful and caring consideration of OpenStreetMap cartography, and talk about the responsibilities we carry as we map the world. They ask you to consider that maps are not _universal_, and that even in OpenStreetMap many different maps and mappings are possible. They propose that a better map may be a _pluriversal_ one, where many different perspectives can coexist. Can OpenStreetMap accommodate this? Which practices can help us produce maps that represent the world more equitably? More importantly, if we think that mapping can make a difference in a time of global precarity, inequalities, climate catastrophe, and mass extinction, then they ask _you_ to care.

	00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:13,160
welcome everyone to our next session on

00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,019
cartography yeah we're very honored to

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,020
introduce two speakers here to you today

00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:20,020
we got David Garcia I think better known

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,810
as map maker to most of you

00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:26,449
he's yea passionate about hot osm and

00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,640
oils geo and very very passionate about

00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:31,640
creating maps as well and he also now

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,110
started researching maps also and the

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,540
use of crowd-sourced geographic

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,060
information for New Zealand specifically

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,609
as he also started his PhD at the

00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,649
university of canterbury last year as

00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:44,629
well and he's presenting today with

00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:46,489
martin deters I think also well known to

00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:48,710
our community he did a lot of amazing

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:51,039
research about hot and the missing maps

00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,940
community told us a lot about ourselves

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,100
enabled us to learn a little bit more

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,989
about ourselves how we model what is

00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,390
motivating us how we are interacting and

00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:01,899
what kind of impact that has and he now

00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,940
works for the Oxford internet Institute

00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:06,770
where he's looking at Wikimedia and the

00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,080
Wikimedia community and Wikimedia data

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,580
and most importantly how the knowledge

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,799
that they shared in Wikipedia is

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,509
controlled in who has actually access to

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,369
the knowledge that is presented in the

00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:17,960
key media and he's now also taking this

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:19,700
conversation further to doors and

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,680
humanity yeah I'm very looking forward

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,079
to hearing more about this we got 45

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,880
minutes for the presentations 40 to 45

00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,770
minutes and then 10 minutes for the

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,340
discussion afterwards as well if the

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,140
flood to you

00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,880
thank you very much Melanie good morning

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,170
everybody I hope you're well I hope you

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:39,710
slept well David and I met a few years

00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,880
ago at a map of Hong and I I saw him

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,159
present there and I was immediately

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,570
fascinated by his cartography and by his

00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,700
way of telling stories about the

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,680
cartographer so we kind of started

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,869
chatting and then we started following

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,880
each other on social media and we now

00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:56,659
live on separate continents but we

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,219
through these kinds of in mutual

00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:00,320
interests that we share we kind of kept

00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:03,530
in touch and then earlier in the year we

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,299
thought because we have kind of

00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,119
complementary perspectives on

00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:10,820
OpenStreetMap and on mapping as a

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,980
practice and on online community and

00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,960
global communities and so on we thought

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,360
maybe we should try and turn that into a

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,400
talk together and and kind of tell tell

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,080
you about some of the stories that we've

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,330
encountered and we've been we've been

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,120
experiencing so the story that we're

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,680
going to talk about today or the

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,930
not that we're giving you today's when

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,090
one way of describing it could be we

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,739
these are our thoughts about the present

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,900
and about the future of OpenStreetMap

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,790
hello I'm David I make maps and I'm now

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,970
a student and I love OpenStreetMap

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,849
I love tracing coral reefs and this this

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,879
also came out this conversation is also

00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:51,879
about something like there is something

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,829
that we say about what we do we're doing

00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,319
we're gonna do this as OpenStreetMap and

00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:58,859
this is what we actually do and this is

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,540
what happens and that's my interest I

00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:05,319
really look for those situations where

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:08,829
the technology is and its limit order

00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,480
surprising ways of using it and as a

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:13,780
Filipino living in New Zealand I've been

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,579
through disaster or war and now I'm

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,430
interested in indigenous issues because

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:19,720
I'm kind of in exile there and I have to

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,190
stay there for a while because it's not

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,590
safe in the country so I thought okay

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:28,209
how do I tell this story because I love

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:30,370
osm and it's a very my life is very

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,169
meaningful because of of OpenStreetMap

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,790
and I think now that I'm a researcher

00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:37,000
how can I still the contribute

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:40,840
OpenStreetMap and can kind of be happy

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,519
and finish the PhD and then we talk and

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,519
then over here so thanks for coming

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,760
so as Melanie said my name's Martin

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,380
these days I call myself an accidental

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,290
academic I started out as a software

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,320
developer and in startups and so on and

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:02,010
then through a few detours ended up

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,430
being being an academic my current job

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,260
title as digital geographer as part of

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,700
my research in the last few years I

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,100
spend a lot of time with hot and miss

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,610
with missing maps and one of the

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,620
questions in the research that we did

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,890
together was how do we grow the

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,260
community so I want to start with with

00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,020
with that I've presented on the on the

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,450
findings at past that previous hot

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,160
summits and and state of the maps so I

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,960
don't want necessarily go into all the

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,020
details but I want to give you a high

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,130
level perspective as a starting point

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,480
and into our talk

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,400
so the question back then really was we

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,510
realize realizing that there there are

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,600
many places in the world there are

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,460
unmapped so we need as many participants

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,520
and in the practice of mapping the world

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,220
as we can now get but we didn't at the

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,800
time really understand what it was that

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,660
drove the enthusiasm of mappers or what

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,750
it was that allowed us to build these

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,370
these large volunteer communities so in

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,770
that research we spent looked at a lot

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,600
of factors that might inform someone's

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,760
decisions to participate and then to

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,800
stick around so we looked at task design

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,160
at the in the tasking manager we looked

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,780
at mapathon zazz setting as both in

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,310
terms of the coordination practice but

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,500
also in terms of the social experience

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,170
we looked at validator feedback the

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,480
importance of receiving a feedback once

00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,040
you've contributed again I won't

00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,360
necessarily give you all the details but

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,650
I really want to give you kind of two

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,870
broad conclusions that I personally got

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,550
out of that research the first is about

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,500
this question of recruiting where do you

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,940
find us or how do you highly how do you

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,910
make these mappers so initially I

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,570
thought my mental model in the beginning

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:48,450
was how do we convert someone into a

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,370
really good mapper so that they they

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,560
enjoy the practice and they stick around

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,270
and then and they contribute well and a

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,050
lot and all these kind of things and

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,760
over time I realized well maybe that's

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,590
part of

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,420
the question maybe also not everybody is

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,960
going to be interested in mapping and

00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:10,550
and I think mapathon sand and

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,860
volunteering as a model form for mapping

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,540
as a kind of context for mapping as

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,180
opposed to you mapping your neighborhood

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,280
volunteering for a social cause really

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,260
Illustrated that to me because through

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,440
hots through missing maps and and

00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,390
organizations like that a lot of a lot

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,520
more people got exposed to the mapping

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,380
practice and largely what we found many

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,030
people who start doing that don't

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,910
necessarily stick around even though

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:37,580
they might maybe appreciate the initial

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,530
experience I think in the end this

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,280
question of what would make someone stay

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:45,500
this is really also a question about the

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,330
person it's really a question about what

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,070
is what are they interested in what do

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,190
they gain what what do they get

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:54,320
enjoyment out of also do they find a

00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,900
social setting in which they're they're

00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,670
comfortable so broadly speaking for me

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,260
that now means maybe it's not really a

00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,970
question of converting someone into a

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,460
mapper but maybe it's a question of

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,870
giving everybody an opportunity and and

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,790
when that happens to give them the

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,460
support but also accepting that not

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,890
everybody is going to to keep doing that

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,240
and so one of the things we learned

00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,720
through the map of thoughts is one of

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,400
the key ways of of doing that is to have

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,620
regular mapping activities that are

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,120
public that are open that are announced

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,700
in advance so maybe that people know

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,040
every first Wednesday of the month I can

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,110
go there these kind of things and we saw

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,000
that really drove in in London and in

00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,210
other places that really drove growth in

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,850
the community the other really important

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,740
lesson we learned is about feedback it's

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,050
also something that came as a bit of a

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,480
surprise to me that we looked at as one

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,550
of the studies we looked at a validator

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,960
feedback what happens when people

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,310
contribute for the first time through

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,350
the tasking manager or maybe at a mapper

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,180
phone maybe at home and then a validator

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,820
looks at their work and then sends them

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,660
a message and then valid marks the task

00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:02,420
as validated or kind of sends it back to

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,560
four or four corrections and we largely

00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:09,020
found to my surprise that it doesn't

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,250
seem to be that bad to be told that you

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,170
did you made some mistakes there

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,240
and many other online communities and

00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,800
Wikipedia Stack Overflow and many other

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,860
places where people get rated for their

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,600
contributions a negative rating can be

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,750
really detrimental to motivations

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,180
because it feels like a public shaming

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,790
validated feedback is private so you

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,010
don't feel shamed when when a validator

00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,760
tells you are here is it how you can do

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,380
better next time

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,659
I think it is important that how the

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,140
validator communicates that what what

00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:41,789
kind of type of message they send

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,740
another thing we found is that something

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,360
that is incredibly powerful for the

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,970
motivation or the decision to stick

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,800
around is to say simply say thanks or to

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,450
simply be appreciative of the

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,970
contribution for many people who

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,190
contributed online maybe the validator

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,620
feedback is the first time they have a

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,170
social encounter with another person in

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,310
an open street map context so it because

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,260
suddenly it becomes really important

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,820
what that person tells you and I think

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,410
for many people it's incredibly

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,140
meaningful to then be told

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,820
thank you your contribution is as

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:17,010
meaningful to us and you helped us

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:18,480
advances further so rather rather than

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:24,000
thinking of it in terms of our kind of

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:26,040
writing system or or yeah as it is

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,690
around many other platforms here I think

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,560
it's closer to the mentoring system and

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,780
I think that's quite important

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,170
interesting so many many more details I

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,580
put last week I published in my

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,710
OpenStreetMap diarrhea published a

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:42,480
summary of the research you can go there

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:44,250
or the links to the papers and so on now

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm a digital geographer at the Oxford

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,200
internet Institute I work with this guy

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,820
here Marc Ram is a geographer he's done

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,589
lots of interesting research in the past

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,290
and he's an information geographer so

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:57,570
with him I do information geography so

00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,130
where geography maybe might ask is there

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,839
a castle in this place is there a

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,000
mountain in this place information

00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,190
geography asks is this castle on

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,710
OpenStreetMap is this mountain on

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,630
OpenStreetMap so a few years ago Mark

00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,890
and his colleagues made this map which

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,110
many of you might might have seen

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,210
already this is the contents density on

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,160
OpenStreetMap if we take all the nodes I

00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,850
believe in data or knots or

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,100
OpenStreetMap

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,710
on a map of the world and we draw that

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,540
as a heat map then we find that

00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,970
well OpenStreetMap at the time I think

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,430
that's 2014 so maybe now looks quite

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,230
different but back in 2014 over 300 I

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,750
was kind of mapping the world but really

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,800
there's a lot of emphasis on Europe and

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,959
North America Japan and some other

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,330
corners of the world at large places in

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,130
the world we're not on map in my current

00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,529
work I also look at Wikipedia and

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,959
Wikipedia you see a very similar kind of

00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:51,330
distribution this again is an old map

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,970
that's from 2011 current Wikipedia looks

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,950
much better but there you'll also see

00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,350
the similar kind of emphasis on Europe

00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:02,070
and North America and a certain certain

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:04,200
countries in East and South Asia as on

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,760
Australia but many other parts of the

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,220
world that were at the time we're not

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,810
really represented on Wikipedia so in my

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,310
current work are partially I'm trying to

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,850
understand why is that why do we see

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,899
these kinds of imbalances of

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,520
representation the fact that certain

00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,760
parts of the world are represented on

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,290
these platforms and others aren't and

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,060
there are many factors I mean in fact it

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,470
would be a whole separate talk to go

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,120
into all the details but I think one of

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,550
one one of the foundational elements

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,920
that is also quite intuitive for us to

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,170
understand a lot of it at the time also

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,450
had to do with connectivity can people

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,830
how easily can people go online so this

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,290
something does not rapidly changing

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,250
because in many parts of the world

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,630
connectivity is getting cheaper and more

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,640
affordable with smartphones and all

00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,680
these kind of things so so this is a

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,150
these are now old numbers by the thing

00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,640
is quite striking a striking way to

00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,680
illustrate that again a map produced by

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,400
Mark and his colleagues this is the cost

00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,029
of broadband connectivity relative to

00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,160
the monthly average salary and once you

00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:03,870
compare it in this way you see that

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,480
there are parts in the world where

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,089
broadband costs more than the monthly

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,510
average salary I think that is quite

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:14,339
striking here we don't I'm European we

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,200
don't think twice about having two three

00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,870
types of connection I have my cell phone

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,480
I've brought man at home my employer has

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,520
broadband so there are many places for

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,959
me to to be connected and there are many

00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,440
parts in the world it's getting better

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,880
rapidly in Africa and other places India

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,140
also is now much more connected than it

00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,970
was 10 years

00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,650
but but still fundamentally it's a case

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,700
brought connectivity is not equal

00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:42,480
equally distributed and as a result we

00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,820
see that not only is representation of

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,430
the world unequally distributed not only

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,040
is Africa for example not as well mapped

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:52,340
as Europe it's also who makes these

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,350
representations is unequally distributed

00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:58,490
so this here is a map of Wikipedia and

00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,990
is asking the question who in the world

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,120
is able to create their own Wikipedia

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,180
articles about their own places so to

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,460
the this shows the extent to which

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,930
articles about countries in Africa have

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,600
been written about people from these

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,130
countries or articles about places in

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,920
Europe have been written about people

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:20,090
from these countries with we can do that

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:23,010
easily in open and Wikipedia because the

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:26,070
IP addresses of anonymity of anonymous

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,660
editors are in the public editor history

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,080
with OpenStreetMap it would be more

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,030
challenging to to show that and again

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,080
you see we see there many places in the

00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,510
world where people don't write their own

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:40,380
Wikipedia articles but instead they're

00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:43,020
being written about by others to their

00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,760
big credit the Wikipedia community is

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,350
really switched on and they they're now

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,430
putting a lot of effort into into

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,870
addressing this issue and in fact

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,690
they've recognized it as a social

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:54,660
injustice they see this is that this is

00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:57,390
the result of a structural inequality is

00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,980
an imbalance in opportunity and they are

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,510
now putting a lot of resources a lot of

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,400
time a lot of effort into addressing

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,230
this and in fact they made if part of

00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,210
their strategy for the coming years is

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,100
one of the central goals for the

00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:10,890
Wikimedia Foundation and the Wikipedia

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,930
community as a whole is it's a concept

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,980
that they call knowledge equity which is

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:20,700
essentially the the value that they now

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,500
hold high to say that the people who are

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,180
being written about on Wikipedia should

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,770
be participating in those

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,510
representations they should be making

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,460
and be able to make decisions about how

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:33,150
their community is how their places are

00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:35,160
being represented on Wikipedia so this

00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,760
an open street map from the beginning we

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,540
had this question of local knowledge

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,640
which is part of that

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,320
but I think the next step from there

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,180
what what what the notion of local

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,400
knowledge does not quite already

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,660
articulate is also the question and at

00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,000
the moment not everybody has an equal

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,470
opportunity to participate so I think

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,800
from an OpenStreetMap perspective this

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,660
is an interesting step to take and as a

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,550
result Wikipedia is they're very active

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,080
very globally active community like the

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,420
opposite mob community so there are

00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,510
hundreds initiatives of initiatives to

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,400
address systemic biases one of the

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,890
challenges is that there are many

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,740
unexpected barriers to participation so

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:20,410
I mentioned one in this connectivity

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:22,840
another one is the fact that the the the

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,400
the capacity to participate to make time

00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,050
available to participate is not equally

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,820
distributed last year I was at wiki

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,920
mania in Cape Town which is global

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,660
gathering of the Wikipedia community

00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,900
where in a Q&A session and African

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,280
editor stood up and said so hold on

00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,610
you're asking us to contribute our

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,940
knowledge for free people here can't

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:45,070
afford to donate their time so she was

00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,410
wasn't long she was a very active

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,870
Wikimedia and Wikipedia and so she she

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:53,140
was not it was a bit of a rhetorical

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,370
provocation in that in that moment but I

00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,820
thought it was a very nice way of

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,170
illustrating an additional barrier of

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,940
participation if you're interested in

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,100
that there's an article that that mark

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,080
and me put on a wired where we tell that

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:09,370
story with a bit more more detail but

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:13,270
largely speaking the the the the summary

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:15,790
is this capacity to volunteer to donate

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:19,180
our time to OpenStreetMap to Wikipedia

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,130
is not globally Universal and in fact

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,890
it's if we look at it from a global

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,060
perspective it's kind of an exception

00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,160
which also means that I've been looking

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,420
at hot sand and a missing map from a

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,040
European perspective from a North

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,870
American perspective with marathons

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,030
volunteering settings and so on most

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:37,840
likely my research does not translate to

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:40,030
many places in the world this also means

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,670
that community mapping which is the

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,560
thing that we are doing also most likely

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,140
because of that looks quite different in

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,880
different places in the world and it

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,430
also means that one of the one of the

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,950
surprising powers of OpenStreetMap and

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,320
of hot and organisations like them

00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,690
is there in fact they are part of a

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,360
global volunteer force I'm a part of a

00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,589
global community community and part of

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,670
an open-source community and all the

00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,870
things but I think they are very

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,520
importantly we also have to recognize

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,980
they're part of a global employment

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,660
network and it is just as important as

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,120
all the other parts because this is one

00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,770
of the ways in which many parts of the

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:21,160
world can participate in the creation of

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:24,309
maps that otherwise could not so all of

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,010
these are kind of steps or kind of

00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,780
perspectives on trying to understand

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,600
what are the limitations of this model

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:34,990
of contributing to OpenStreetMap what

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,059
what are things that maybe look the same

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,200
around the world maybe aren't there

00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:40,720
there are other questions we could look

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,220
at so a long-running question in the

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,200
OpenStreetMap community particularly in

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,940
the hub community what do we do about

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,330
vulnerable communities sometimes being

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,650
maps also exposes you to risk how do we

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,299
deal with sacred knowledge their

00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:55,049
communities in the world who don't want

00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:57,130
certain knowledge to me right public

00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:59,730
there's there's a language barrier

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,049
um I was talking event from

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,600
OpenStreetMap India the other day and he

00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:06,760
had a very nice example of the language

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,549
barrier this OpenStreetMap the the main

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,799
sites about India is everything is

00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:14,080
labeled in English the English is spoken

00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,450
in India but only 20 to 30 percent of

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,190
the countries speak it there depending

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,590
on how you count their 20 official

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:24,460
languages in India about 70 are spoken

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:26,290
in India so they would one language for

00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,000
one country would not make sense and

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,559
that's in that situation so as a

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,470
response OpenStreetMap India is now

00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,510
experimenting with bike vector tiles

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,640
which allows one of the issues with with

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:40,809
language selection on OpenStreetMap is

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,270
it requires terabytes of space to to

00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:45,220
store all the tiles and if you were to

00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,919
offer multiple language version based on

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,840
the raster it would it would be become

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,880
incredibly expensive but vector Charles

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,559
one of the surprising side effects of

00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,460
offering vector tiles as a way of

00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,010
displaying the map is it allows dynamic

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,260
kind of

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,550
adjustments like localization so

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,559
OpenStreetMap India is now play

00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,480
experimenting with vector tiles where

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,940
any selector a language selector they

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,200
don't it's there they have a first set

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,650
of languages and I imagine they're

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,070
they're just going to expand that in

00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:19,710
order to address the language barrier so

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:21,540
let's say the idea editor was an

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,640
important credibly important technology

00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,880
to make it easy for newcomers to

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,920
contribute to OpenStreetMap I think

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,020
vector Charles maybe so surprisingly

00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,210
will be an incredibly important

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,100
technology for the world to be able to

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:40,290
consume the map in their language

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:43,470
appropriately for their context so for

00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:46,200
me as a technologist the my journey over

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,059
the last ten years was has been a kind

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,580
of a process of unlearning of realizing

00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,929
me as a European as a as a computer

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,670
scientist and so on I have a particular

00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:55,500
perspective but there are many things in

00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,780
the worlds that I don't actually see and

00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,360
yet I'm as a software developer I am

00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,490
being asked to write software for the

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,170
world so the journey for me over the

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,809
last 10 years was to slowly realize well

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,190
really I can't because the assumption

00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:10,050
that we're usually making as

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,970
technologists that we build one

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:15,210
technology one software one platform one

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,480
mapping process one editor for all of

00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:20,240
the world something that is universal

00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,880
this may be actually not that useful and

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,950
maybe there's a kind of post-colonial

00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,870
term which I think is very useful in the

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,550
business context maybe what we should

00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,890
actually be striving for is something

00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,770
that is pure reversal because it is not

00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,510
one world that looks the same everywhere

00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,940
it's actually in fact many worlds many

00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,800
circumstances many capacities many

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:46,010
different needs they all coexist at the

00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:48,300
same time so the fascinating thing about

00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:50,880
OpenStreetMap for me as a as a

00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,640
phenomenon as a movement as a community

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,179
as a set of technologies and so on is

00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:00,030
that we quite mature now after after 15

00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:02,580
years and we've come really far but yet

00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:04,559
we are still regularly finding us

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,110
ourselves in situations where we are

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,049
running out of understanding of how to

00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:12,010
do this well I think

00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:13,659
that the general aspiration of

00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:16,390
OpenStreetMap which I would articulate

00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:19,870
as a map for the world built on local

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:22,210
knowledge driven by a global community I

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:27,520
think that is that is a very there's

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:29,980
very nice vision and I think what what I

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,559
wanted to express and then I think what

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,640
I'm also getting from from from the

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,650
conversation that I've been having over

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,330
the last few months we will still it

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,809
still brings us back to these questions

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,070
how do we do it as well okay that's it

00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:45,370
for me I'm going to hand over to David

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:49,630
and then in the end we'll come together

00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:51,940
again thanks Marty oh my so nervous okay

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,010
hello everyone I'd like first of all I'd

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,039
like to ask who's an indigenous person

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,860
in the room I also think that's a

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,659
problem and maybe we can work on that

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:04,450
another I'd like to thank everyone who

00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:06,880
was the reason why I'm here a long way

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,980
for me to participate in my first State

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,750
of the map you wouldn't believe me how

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,169
how I got theirs I think my friends

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:16,720
co-workers people of Aotearoa New

00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:18,520
Zealand who funded my scholarship my mom

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,120
she paid for the ticket this is for you

00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,970
Bob I participated in osm and my life

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,260
gets mini because of osm right now I'm a

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,330
PhD student

00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,890
I'm writing a sari it's a personal one

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,720
and this is the title how to map an

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,659
island in the Pacific

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,570
I make nice maps this is kind of my

00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:39,010
daily therapy and these are the samples

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,780
this is where I live on the Left it's

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,010
out your OVA also known as New Zealand

00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,870
but this is where I came from

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,480
it's Philippine seven thousand six

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,100
hundred forty one Islands it's a Cebu

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,409
tefillin that we place at the same time

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,870
there's a popular saying in our place

00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:55,240
especially in the Pacific cultures if

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:58,140
you want to know where you're going then

00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,809
you should know where you came from and

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:04,690
this is our story the story of the

00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:08,320
Pacific people's they migrated it from

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:10,470
Southeast Asia before the others did the

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,120
rest for China nice we settled the ocean

00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,500
well before the European state and this

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,960
is a forgotten story that you should

00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,149
know we were there first and our

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,700
knowledge of series including this

00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,730
knowledge this is a map it doesn't have

00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,580
boundaries

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:27,290
the shells represent islands and the six

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,820
represent the ocean swells the

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:31,430
relationships between the islands and

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:34,160
our ancestors use this for every voyage

00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:37,820
and felt the waves and use the Stars and

00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:40,790
it's a different world view it's not a

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:44,350
polygon it's not a vector tile and it's

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:46,990
embody this is also where I came from

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,550
when the volcano exploded in our town in

00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,770
1981 the volcanoes name is spinet Oba

00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,480
our life was very difficult at the same

00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:56,270
day there was a typhoon so we were very

00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,220
lucky the largest eruption of the past

00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:01,310
three decades and a type one at the same

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,200
time our towns robbery and left well

00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,960
life was kind of difficult and then I

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,510
went to college where I lived in a slum

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,770
for about seven years and I learned

00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,810
mapping there because you're addressing

00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,640
disasters like this one this happened

00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,790
today 10 years ago it's called typhoon

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,630
Ondoy and I don't see the slides here

00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:22,460
but this is this is also part of my osm

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,170
journey because this is how I learned

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,820
how to make maps we were making maps

00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:28,040
with indigenous peoples in the upland

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:32,990
and try to understand the floods and

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:34,880
when this typhoon in 2013 typhoon Haiyan

00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,980
was the strongest cyclone to make

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,200
landfall in global history by then and

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,980
this is how it looked like this is in

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,930
Tacloban

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,670
incidentally it's it was the same place

00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,230
where friend out the Miguel Miguel EIS

00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:47,210
or Ferdinand de magallanes when they

00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,580
were circumnavigating the world they

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,200
arrived in the Philippines here's it so

00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,790
globally important historically

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,980
important place

00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,980
the sad part is a thousands of people

00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,720
died so one week before the typhoon

00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,850
there is a group of OpenStreetMap

00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,920
volunteers and they said hey David

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,740
there's a typhoon coming it's a week

00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,420
from now we know where the path is we

00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,700
need to make maps and there's this thing

00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:13,520
called a map a pod and we need to do

00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,560
this so the responders can can can do

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,600
their job and I was I was a journey

00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,700
instructor in a GIS laboratory in the

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,430
university okay how do I do this well

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,310
okay this is the door use use of

00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:27,770
computers and everyone was doing this

00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:30,530
for for couple of months and if you

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,910
helped us and you're a part of this I'd

00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,190
like to thank you very much

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,570
this is the result the before and after

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,870
in

00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:39,669
and this was very useful because we had

00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,440
to understand the places where the

00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:43,029
recovery was going to happen I and I

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,460
eventually left the University and

00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:48,039
became a humanitarian worker for example

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,649
this is the the destroyed Beach and

00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:52,570
that's where the soil was and the winds

00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,909
were so strong that that piece of food

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:56,200
wasn't there before the typhoon so back

00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:58,889
then it's in there you were killed by

00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,750
the waves are killed by the strong winds

00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:03,880
pick your choice choose between the two

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,299
I'll focus on this island and I love it

00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,850
very much

00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:08,620
it's called victory island even after

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:12,309
the disaster government was evicting

00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:14,169
them for for some weird reason but it's

00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:16,210
a very beautiful place in the middle of

00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:18,549
a reef and I just finished tracing the

00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:20,320
reef recently it's very wonderful this

00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:22,240
is how it looks like in OpenStreetMap

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,970
but the sad part is that in government

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,580
maps it's just a coral so OpenStreetMap

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:30,970
was very instrumental in in addressing

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:33,549
that special injustice there are 700

00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:35,049
people there they lost their relatives

00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:37,690
the bodies were never found and they're

00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:39,700
not even on the map so we use open

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:41,919
street map to map with the communities

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,450
and not for the communities and we found

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,460
out that in the process of the

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:48,159
participatory mapping that they've been

00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,840
living there for 30 years and they've

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,409
been reclaiming the island with with

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,500
trash

00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:55,360
and it looks like this and for me

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,419
OpenStreetMap was a way for us to help

00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,190
understand your situation so ok we made

00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:04,299
maps to them and because there's no

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:06,429
internet no no smartphone there no no

00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:08,590
internet access no a lack of electricity

00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,330
we made paper maps and laminated them

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,889
and put them in tarpaulin because

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,169
there's a lot of rain and it's a high

00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:17,320
entropy environment and talked about the

00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:19,899
evacuation recovery etc for about a year

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:23,590
we stayed there for for quite some time

00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:26,799
I even became a judge of a local beauty

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,690
pageant in the process and then the year

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,320
in the year after there's another

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,809
typhoon

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,070
it came to the same area and gladly no

00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:34,870
one no one died because people

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,700
understood the maps they were part of

00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:40,600
the making of the map we were not just

00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,129
making maps for them but with them and I

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,010
think maybe that made all the difference

00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:47,860
so the missing maps

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,480
and then the because the job contracts

00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,220
with an international and named the

00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,040
international agency were very short I

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,540
had to get the scholarship the contacts

00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,340
were just three months short and then I

00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,870
got a scholarship to UCL and I met

00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,309
missing maps and that's where

00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,530
OpenStreetMap happened spent the year

00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:04,870
there try to educate myself once more

00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:07,240
because there after I went back to the

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,880
Philippines and I went to a city called

00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,049
Bowie with with a group with the team

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,820
because Isis and the government were

00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:14,380
fighting months before and we were

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,929
tracing buildings things or some

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,360
Philippines and others so that recovery

00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:22,059
and the construction can can be we can

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,820
help in that this is for a photo I took

00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:27,160
inside the the war zone and it's a very

00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,740
very important experience for me so

00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:33,549
again with when an urban planner had in

00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:36,460
a GIS person had I tried to but we tried

00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:38,530
to facilitate something this is also

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,990
part of this story because there are

00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:43,720
moments during that exercise when I as a

00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,390
specialist wanted to do the same thing

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,250
that we did in the typhoon moment okay

00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:51,179
let's finish the map let's make the GIS

00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:55,660
files very very clean good projection

00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:58,570
the topologies clip and and fit and the

00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:01,179
cadastral files are clean but then the

00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,890
participants only well and some of them

00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:04,179
are almost crying during the activity

00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,880
they said well they with if you talk

00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:08,470
about this you know our clan members are

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,990
fighting and they there are disputes

00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:14,049
over the land if you push this too far I

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,820
don't think we will produce peace so at

00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:17,590
that moment I thought well am i

00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,049
mapmaking or our peacemaking

00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:22,120
and maybe there are moments when the

00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:26,650
right thing to do is to not make a map

00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:28,450
and to just listen and then we were also

00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,710
doing this at the same time this is kind

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,570
of relate that you're mapping human

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:34,000
rights violations under the current

00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:36,309
government but it became very dangerous

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,770
and surveillance and all of that great

00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:41,020
stuff so I went to New Zealand to start

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:44,470
a PhD we're kind of ok this is a safe

00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:47,410
space and then I've been thinking ok

00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:48,910
what am I gonna do now I I still

00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,440
remember this phrase it's very important

00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,929
for me if you want to know where you're

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:56,169
going you should remember where you came

00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:57,159
from so I tried to go back to the basic

00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,380
OS and

00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,240
with these try to trace sweeps that's

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,630
hard shape that's very nice

00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:07,000
it's fun during lunch I also make one

00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:10,539
map every day using opposite map data

00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,700
and blender and use the the polygons

00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:16,659
there operate open street map

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:18,159
contributors and also participate in in

00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:19,840
hot especially every Friday during

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,340
excavations because I'd like to give

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,990
back because you helped us in the

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,659
Philippines and I really feel the need

00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,519
that I should I should give back I'm

00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,960
becoming part of this community too and

00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,090
we're inviting you to Wellington in

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,409
November for our own shine a conference

00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,070
because it's gonna be fun it's the

00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:38,529
second one and now an hour here now I'm

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:40,539
here in front of you I like this image

00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:42,190
that the monkey with the mirror because

00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:45,250
there's something written in the website

00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,129
and it's very important too and it's sad

00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,110
it holds a mirror to remind anyone

00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:51,700
crossing the bridge they look back from

00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,549
where they came from and remember

00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,289
remember who they are

00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:57,580
there's popular thing in the Pacific if

00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:58,840
you want to know where you're going then

00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:02,220
you should know where it came from

00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,809
because I'm kind of lost right now I

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,429
went back to the Philippines last August

00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:07,870
or July I went back to the typhoon zone

00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:09,940
in the war zone and I tried to remember

00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,110
ok David why are you doing this why are

00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,370
you mapping and you know it's very

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:17,500
existential and I've also been trying to

00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:19,360
study Pacific cultures event Oxford last

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,779
July and by accident there's a display

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,399
this was our display our the charts the

00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:28,570
ocean charts of our Pacific ancestors

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:31,000
the sad part is these these treasures

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:35,519
are not in the hands of Pacific people's

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,519
most of them are here in in Germany and

00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:41,769
maybe the sad part is besides this image

00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,450
there's apparition there's there's a

00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:45,279
description it says it means something

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,110
like this this was an Oxford last July

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,509
and I found it by accident

00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:53,919
he said the Pacific navigation

00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:55,809
traditions decline in response to the

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,850
European colonization of the Pacific I

00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:01,389
said ok maybe that's an honest telling

00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:03,159
but then well yeah it's not just in

00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:05,260
response to but because of because we

00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:08,200
lost lands we lost labor lost our lives

00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,160
even lost knowledge and now we can even

00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,580
read the stories

00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:16,630
does this kind of triggered another

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:19,140
thought process so what now again what

00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,310
does it mean for us in the Pacific and

00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,050
I've been thinking well it's obviously

00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:27,790
map gonna be another story of an

00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:29,350
outsider discovering us discovery if you

00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:31,690
look at osm we've been trying to avoid

00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:34,570
that to be very very honest and him very

00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:36,970
thing for this movement on the left is a

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:38,710
painting in Hammond in Frankfort it's

00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,600
nearby it's called the geographer by

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,990
Johannes Vermeer it's a very beautiful

00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:50,050
one it's a it's but it's a plastic image

00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:53,410
of this you know this sense rational map

00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:57,700
maker geographer drawing other places

00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:59,860
this explore discovered the world but he

00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,540
doesn't really understand the lives of

00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,400
the people he's mapping and he's a he

00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,280
and we should be thankful and he is the

00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,550
hero so I thought well what does this

00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:17,710
mean for us and then this is this image

00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:19,480
were in mana we're a work worthy are we

00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,680
gonna leave this model on the left and

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,470
go to the right and have a more diverse

00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,780
community because I think it's not just

00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:29,920
the maps that are missing the map makers

00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:31,390
are missing too and also they're missing

00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,790
stories about the mapping time we should

00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,470
tell more of that so I'm not making any

00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:37,060
Universal claim your honor I don't want

00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:39,570
to fight but I think these are things

00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:42,940
that we should ponder on because again

00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:45,310
going from the quote earlier I think for

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,780
us if about the point that there is that

00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,300
there's no indigenous person in this

00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:52,000
room if the day will come that if you

00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,700
wanted the a day to come when there will

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,220
be a person right here an indigenous

00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:00,580
person and that person loves of a street

00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,950
map how can we make that happen how can

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,930
we become a good opposite map as a star

00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,180
because other awesome volunteers are

00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,440
also good ancestors to me they helped in

00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,179
the London marathons

00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,310
they showed me how to do it and

00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,960
obviously map doing hand I asked for

00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,030
help during though in the war zone and

00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,159
it did that so I think we need we need

00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,760
to continue doing that and what I'm

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,050
learning so far is

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,990
is this that in OpenStreetMap we each of

00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,850
us kind of pays attention to a different

00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,860
thing more some of us be attached to the

00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,290
accuracy and availability others okay

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,330
let's meet this I make it accessible or

00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,760
no I'm gonna teach students make them

00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,290
more able the ability and there are some

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,820
of us or focus on the ethics and the

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:43,580
haunt ability and and it's all wonderful

00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:48,080
and it makes makes me reflect about

00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:50,659
these points something like okay for for

00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,280
us to have a better movement maybe let's

00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:55,330
see the world from another volunteers

00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:58,790
ice maybe that that will help a lot and

00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:00,170
I really like this this this part the

00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,640
third question what if there are time

00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,680
situations or moments when the right

00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,950
thing to do is to not may come up and to

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,100
step back and do not be the hero and to

00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:12,650
let another person take the map and run

00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:15,380
with it I'm stealing a hold from

00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:18,800
computer to dress a very nice way to do

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,780
a literature review it's very nice right

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,180
we don't have to be a voice for the

00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,750
voiceless sometimes we just need to pass

00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,970
the mic so I leave you with this message

00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:31,280
maybe it's not just about hashtag bridge

00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:35,740
the map maybe it's also time to the pass

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,740
the map thank you very much

00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,800
[Applause]

00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:54,410
this guy's making me cry every time he

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,730
speaks so we we felt in addition to tell

00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:59,960
you these stories we thought you should

00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:01,430
also try and find a way to kind of find

00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,660
find some kind of essence and find find

00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:09,140
some kinds of core learnings for us that

00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:11,510
we that we want to share with you and I

00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,430
think one of the things that has been

00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:18,440
coming clear to both of us through

00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:21,859
through this work is that while it's

00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,859
it's a novel aim to have one map of the

00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:27,650
world it might be an impossibility and

00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:33,410
in fact maybe we should not even try to

00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:34,880
do that try to force that to happen and

00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,390
in fact maybe the question is more how

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,190
can we have multiple maps of the world

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,780
coexist there there are different ways

00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:45,109
of thinking about it conceptually I

00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,329
talked about it I once already described

00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:49,630
as a notion of vertical maps of kind of

00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:52,250
vertical realities that scan towards us

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,750
and the question then it also is like

00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:57,829
what feeds into this map and what makes

00:36:53,750 --> 00:37:00,290
that map exist and and I think David

00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:02,480
articulates us really well and is also

00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,849
part of our responsibility of mappers

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,130
it's also also to recognize that

00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:09,230
sometimes it should not be me who draws

00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,780
that part who makes that particular map

00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:14,420
and sometimes it should be someone who

00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:16,549
has a different kind of experience or an

00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:20,329
experience of that place that I don't

00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:22,130
have I think also as a social space for

00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:24,430
hot that there's equally true that

00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:27,099
sometimes it should not be me who

00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:29,390
coordinates the initiative or who

00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:31,670
organizes the events or who is the

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:33,049
keynote speaker and sometimes it should

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:36,710
be someone else or someone with someone

00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:41,210
who's the board member or any any of

00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:43,490
those and any of those roles yep

00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:45,650
I'd like to do touch on this points two

00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:47,809
and three this is just very obvious

00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:50,720
because I think in the in the GIS

00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:53,590
literature for the for the guys kicks

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,780
out here OpenStreetMap is called crowds

00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:58,420
since state the collection but the more

00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,930
I say in the movement this is a lot of

00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,300
work

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:03,430
this is labored and takes time and

00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,050
course and you need to emphasize that

00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:07,660
it's not just crowdsourcing this is

00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:11,020
called work and that's very important

00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,640
and the connection to that we want to

00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,650
recognize the wide range of labor that

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,720
goes behind the making of the map so the

00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,550
mapathon happens because someone bought

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,740
the pizza and the beers and we'll talk

00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:23,440
to the sponsor someone tweeted about it

00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,630
and people invited young people and they

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,780
might not they're volunteers here or we

00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:30,340
don't have a high number of changes and

00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,920
then the edits but they do all of that

00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:34,330
labor just so that the mapping it

00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,210
happened so I'd like to encourage you to

00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,770
think about that in our that

00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,050
relationship to improve our relationship

00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:44,200
with the people who might not have the

00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,450
time to have 1,000 buildings in one week

00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,530
but they they work behind the scenes to

00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,860
make that happen

00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:53,950
that's for point number three number

00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:56,620
four - I I'll pass I'll mention this now

00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:58,330
maybe we can all spread I scare whatever

00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,970
whatever that means

00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:03,550
me as a neurodiverse person sometimes my

00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:06,040
hand shakes and it was very nice because

00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,530
whenever there was an activation and it

00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:11,380
can't participate Russ or Rebecca says

00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,490
well yeah make some time how are you

00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,520
that's very nice

00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:17,710
and my question there is okay who cares

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:22,300
for the people who care we should also

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:24,760
ask about them and for me that also

00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,110
resonates because as part of doing this

00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,300
work over the last few years I also

00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:31,270
sometimes took on too much and more and

00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,970
more than I should and in in the final

00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:36,400
stages of my PhD I had my first ever and

00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:39,130
hopefully only ever panic attack which

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:43,540
was a circumstance where I was on three

00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:45,580
deadlines on five projects and had

00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,260
finished some but there is seemed like a

00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,390
never-ending thing and I received an

00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,560
email by someone who was talking about a

00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,210
project that I thought we had finished

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,410
and they had an additional request can

00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,910
we refine this and so on which in

00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,190
principle is nice but in that moment I

00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,960
panicked and it remembers staring at my

00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:01,730
screen and and and physically being

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,230
unable to respond and I recognized

00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,609
but what I was just going through it I

00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,890
realize what the only thing I need to do

00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:09,079
right now is close my laptop and and go

00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,519
on a long walk and to me that there was

00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:13,609
a there was a wake-up call and made me

00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:17,480
realize that this this question of care

00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:18,950
is essential when we care about the work

00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,190
and when we put effort behind the work

00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:23,990
and maybe ambitious and and and when we

00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:26,539
feel the urgency maybe also sometimes of

00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:28,549
the situation that we also recognize the

00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:31,190
first loyalty that we should have is to

00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:33,230
ourselves and and to the people around

00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,670
us and we should support them in that

00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,710
journey and I think that's really

00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,240
important something to that this is a

00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:41,450
very important moment so last March 15

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,930
the crisis tears of that happened near

00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:47,359
where I live but the miracle of the

00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:50,599
moment I suppose was the first folks who

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:54,410
asked are you okay David was obviously

00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:56,240
people and we said hey I refined few

00:40:54,410 --> 00:41:01,000
minutes after that and for me that's

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:03,440
that's that's wonderful now okay next

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,660
how are we for time we have got many

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,670
stories where we're now we've been up

00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:10,670
wondering how much how much detail we

00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:13,400
cannot go into oh you already know it's

00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:15,440
good it's good we've got we should close

00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,329
in around 12 minutes so we got 12

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,920
minutes per discussions now as well okay

00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:20,119
let's listen maybe very briefly touch

00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,410
over the last two points and then and

00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:23,750
then we couldn't we couldn't jump to

00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:25,490
questions so one of the things that

00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,289
again would be kind of its own talk but

00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:30,349
we touched on it in a number of

00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:32,150
different races I think one of the

00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:34,519
things that for OpenStreetMap and for

00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:36,490
hot and organizations like them could be

00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:39,079
really useful is to find ways of

00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:41,240
codifying our understanding of our

00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,009
responsibilities as mappers but I

00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,109
noticed in some of the projects I was

00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:46,670
involved in outside of OpenStreetMap

00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:47,329
that but that had to do with geo data

00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,369
and so on

00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:51,049
is is that sometimes you will be given

00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:52,579
professional opportunities to do work

00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:55,519
where you're not entirely sure how to

00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:57,230
assess can I do this responsibly and I

00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,700
was in one of those circumstances and I

00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,710
realized my professional training had

00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,599
not prepared me to answer really that

00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:04,910
question and thankfully I was surrounded

00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:06,650
by people who I could see get guidance

00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,079
from and in the end in this particular

00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,809
circumstance I ended up declining

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,430
the job but I really recognized at the

00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:14,529
moment we often we don't know how to

00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,630
assess should we be doing those so I

00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:18,009
think OpenStreetMap and hearts and

00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:22,029
organizations like them they should have

00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:23,859
a professional code like a code of of

00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:25,509
mapper ethics or whatever you might want

00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:29,140
to call it the basic set of principles

00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:33,670
that allow us to as practitioners as

00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:35,650
markers to assess how we can be

00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:38,589
responsible in our activity mmm I'll

00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:42,130
mention the last one briefly so when I

00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:43,839
was racing indigenous issues concerns I

00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:47,109
thought well I'm gonna lead the project

00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,839
David are there gonna be the person but

00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:53,170
this is not me I am NOT an indigenous

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,450
person I am a Filipino national a nice

00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:57,279
Philippine national but I am NOT an

00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:01,239
indigenous person trying hard to be an

00:42:57,279 --> 00:43:03,190
ally I think so our worried relatives in

00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:05,170
the Pacific but I'm not an indigenous

00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:08,619
person in this is why I put that last

00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:10,390
point here I dream of a day when there's

00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:13,180
someone and the bar was an indigenous

00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:14,769
person because that's very important

00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:17,410
someone who embodies the experience who

00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:18,549
really understands what it's like to do

00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:21,069
for you to lose your land because

00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:23,949
someone drew a map that's very important

00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:26,739
for us because now I was thinking in

00:43:23,949 --> 00:43:29,199
2050 reckon I look back as the opposite

00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:29,729
our family we thought you were the good

00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:33,059
guys

00:43:29,729 --> 00:43:36,219
what's gonna happen so imagine that no

00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:37,749
will it be different or will it be like

00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:40,809
right now how can you be a good

00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:44,079
OpenStreetMap ancestor thank you that's

00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:45,130
it well maybe as a last word I think

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,289
it's likely that we don't want to leave

00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,479
you on a dark note as I was not the

00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:51,489
intention of the talk I think in all

00:43:49,479 --> 00:43:54,339
this throughout all these experiences

00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:56,319
it's also important to acknowledge and

00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:57,819
to recognize that contributing to

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,400
OpenStreetMap is an incredibly joyful

00:43:57,819 --> 00:44:02,380
experience and it is because we get to

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,349
meet people like you and we get to meet

00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,880
each other I get to be friends with

00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:09,759
David so otherwise I would never have

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,390
met and and I deeply admired the guy and

00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:16,749
my life is enriched because of it and

00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:17,890
and maybe sometimes that makes you look

00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:19,839
at the world differently and I think

00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,890
fundamentally that's that's what we're

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,480
talking about

00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:24,510
and sometimes less is hard and sometimes

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,599
it's joyful and both kind of coexist

00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,599
thank you

00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:38,890
[Applause]

00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,840
great yeah thank you so much I think

00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,360
yeah we could talk alright yeah listen

00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:45,610
to you talk or what a whole afternoon

00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,170
actually but yeah yeah we're you're

00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,890
still around today as well and we got

00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:51,010
now

00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,900
yeah around 8 8 minutes left for a

00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:55,300
discussion are there any questions

00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,970
Jennifer yep all right thank you very

00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,730
much that was absolutely brilliant I

00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:02,890
wondered I totally agree that we should

00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:04,480
be trying to put marginalized

00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:06,700
communities and individuals in the

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,050
center and I but I wondered if you

00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:12,670
thought that that we are somehow

00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:17,730
OpenStreetMap is going away from that by

00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:21,970
the influence of big corporates mapping

00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:25,930
activities and I also thought do you

00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:28,810
think we as we have a responsibility not

00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:30,460
to be working with authoritarian regimes

00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:32,980
that are actually working against

00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,080
indigenous people perhaps I'm thinking

00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:43,150
particularly in the in places like the

00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:44,560
Philippines I think I think the the

00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:47,110
question like when what I've been

00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,940
learning for me a good illustration of

00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,860
this is the Facebook automated imports

00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,690
where where I think the fear that I'm

00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:55,960
hearing that you're articulating is the

00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:58,150
fear of a large powerful organization

00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,360
that kind of takes over and I think the

00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:03,370
Facebook journey really illustrates to

00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,440
me how even if it starts out in a way

00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:07,300
that would tell us many babies not as it

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,400
should have started out in the end I

00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,500
think the the the the circumstances we

00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,560
finding it ourselves and now this these

00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:17,980
imports are organized now we're in in

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:20,050
fact it's now communities and organizers

00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:22,360
who are in charge of saying this is

00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:24,850
where we want the support of the machine

00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:27,790
but fundamentally is so organized and

00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:29,800
coordinated by humans so I think that's

00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:32,710
an illustration of I think the best

00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,600
possible outcome and in any one of those

00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:37,120
circumstances where we initially we

00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,280
might be concerned about an imbalance of

00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,440
capacity or an imbalance of power I

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,170
think the real strength of OpenStreetMap

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,930
as an ecosystem is that we we work

00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:47,000
through in part

00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:48,650
through discourse that someone proposes

00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,359
something in someone else response and

00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,210
then we have a dialogue and then out of

00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:55,550
that ultimately the outcome emerges and

00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,990
I think that's really powerful I have a

00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,790
quick answer the part about the

00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:01,970
authoritarian regimes I really can't the

00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:04,329
treating varies part about working with

00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:07,010
corporates this is a very personal

00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:08,690
observation the people I worked with in

00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:10,490
the in the war zone in the disaster zone

00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:14,420
when our contracts and they're very

00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:17,030
employed by corporates that's how they

00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,680
can continue to become osm volunteer so

00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,720
they still do the volunteering organize

00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,819
things we had an open street map Cape

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,430
during the 15th anniversary last last

00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:27,020
time that was fun

00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:29,599
but they have to pay the bills and they

00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:32,990
have children and there were someone to

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,369
pay them to do over sell so I don't know

00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:36,770
if that's a normative statement or not

00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:42,740
but that's that's what's happening Janet

00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:46,640
thank you for the more questions yeah

00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:50,480
vomit thanks Rob

00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:54,020
well you made a very good point that we

00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:57,559
should pay the contributors I believe

00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:00,530
totally that in this world where one of

00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:03,440
the functional fuel is money you cannot

00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:05,960
run an engine that solidly works on

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,670
motivation and recognition I mean you

00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,670
need to bring something which is more

00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:13,849
tangible so keeping that in mind how do

00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:17,240
you see value propagation should take

00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:21,109
place which is a monopoly independent

00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:25,040
and which is being driven by the

00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:27,140
protocol I don't know or how that should

00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:32,240
work I mean so that the contributor

00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:36,410
should make something like which is he

00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:38,630
wish he can he or she can touch I don't

00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:40,940
know this is well how do you how do you

00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:45,339
perceive this situation like you have a

00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,339
picture in mind in that direction or

00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:51,140
so it's the acoustics in this room are

00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,640
quite bad it was quite quite hard to

00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,140
understand your question but so yeah in

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,510
part you're asking about the question of

00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,549
labor and then payment yes yeah but I'm

00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:01,270
not totally I would I don't believe in

00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:04,369
like wage kind of system but rather

00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:06,980
value value that's a contributor has

00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:10,339
general value and how it should come

00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:11,690
back to him that is more tangible so the

00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:14,180
question in part is the question of

00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:16,849
incentivization right what what what

00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:21,380
yeah how should we reward contribution

00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:25,369
NZ will do more you mean like mana in

00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:26,660
simple words yeah it's quite a

00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:28,490
complicated question I say any other

00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,630
thing so thank you for asking my

00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,400
question because it remains unanswered

00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:33,740
like fundamentally there is not a

00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,710
straightforward question to answer you

00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:38,690
can look at it from the perspective of

00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:40,490
motivational psychology which was my

00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:42,859
original research looking at what drives

00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:45,109
mappers and and there we largely find

00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:46,940
that in volunteering settings people

00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:48,680
kind of have their own motivations and

00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,900
they they get their own enjoyment out of

00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,390
the practice and you don't need to give

00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,029
them candy in order to keep them around

00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:57,980
in fact just make sure that there are no

00:49:56,029 --> 00:50:00,440
barriers to participation and for them

00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:03,859
that's already has value and and and

00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:05,720
often as valuing has a kind of reward in

00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:07,819
itself and when you then start

00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:10,520
introducing payment that's actually

00:50:07,819 --> 00:50:12,289
often discouraging like volunteering and

00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,359
payment does not really easily get along

00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:19,660
and in fact often it's it's it's it's

00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:24,049
quite powerful yeah but mass adoption is

00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:25,130
also one of the requirement okay well so

00:50:24,049 --> 00:50:26,480
that was the first part in the second

00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:27,980
part is the the reason why this

00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,470
challenge because this does not apply to

00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,869
all the world circumstances and all the

00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:34,369
individual circumstances and for some

00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:36,289
people the question is not how can I

00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:39,230
volunteer my time but the question is

00:50:36,289 --> 00:50:42,859
like how can I earn how can I again

00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:44,480
market employment skills how can I

00:50:42,859 --> 00:50:47,630
advance myself personally and

00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:50,450
professionally how can i educate myself

00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:53,599
in a way that maybe it allows me to

00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:56,569
build a better future for my family how

00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,660
can I respond to circumstances in my

00:50:56,569 --> 00:51:00,809
community

00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:02,730
that we are affected by and what what

00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:04,589
active steps can I take all these kind

00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,160
of things and top of that how do I pay

00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:07,559
my rent

00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,000
yeah while doing that I'd like to add to

00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:12,230
that kind of a counterpoint to what I

00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
said about employment I also recognize

00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:18,230
that's the sheer pleasure of making a

00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,339
map piece for the craft mappers out here

00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:23,849
that's very important you're not paid

00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:25,920
you know you just enjoy it and we just

00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:28,529
have to recognize that that lutely

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,750
that there's inherent value in that in

00:51:28,529 --> 00:51:33,509
itself you're nothing of any purpose I'm

00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:37,740
just this a nice polygon and I close it

00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:40,380
and in fact it feels right mmm as basic

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:41,849
as that so I think largely what we're

00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,740
trying also trying to say is I don't

00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:45,660
think there is one way of rewarding all

00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:48,359
OpenStreetMap matters I think there are

00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:50,970
many ways and they're all kind of thick

00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:52,200
also varies by the person people

00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,109
different people might go for different

00:51:52,200 --> 00:52:00,480
things doesn't answer your question

00:51:54,109 --> 00:52:03,599
thank you yeah I think versity hello

00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:06,630
okay yeah you raised a number of good

00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,519
points in saying that yeah I remember

00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:11,039
one thing that you mentioned there might

00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:14,069
be for example holy sites should we map

00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:18,259
them in how far we do we need to respect

00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:20,660
local customs and so on in a larger

00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:23,670
pulling that up a bit

00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:25,710
many wars have been fought on the planet

00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:28,049
about people thinking that they have a

00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,789
good idea that should benefit everyone

00:52:28,049 --> 00:52:31,710
like you know we have democracy you also

00:52:29,789 --> 00:52:34,170
need to have democracy we will send our

00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:35,009
troops to help you get democracy or

00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,960
something like that

00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:40,549
we have this religion and it's going to

00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:43,410
benefit everyone sometimes I wonder if

00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:46,259
maybe OpenStreetMap is not the right

00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:48,269
thing for everyone maybe this idea we

00:52:46,259 --> 00:52:50,160
have OpenStreetMap it is so great and

00:52:48,269 --> 00:52:53,490
it's had have already helped all these

00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,710
people it's also going to help you let's

00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:58,700
put this marginalised group on the map

00:52:55,710 --> 00:53:00,800
because we are sure that it will benefit

00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:03,890
maybe sometimes I sometimes feel there

00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:06,320
might be a hint of cultural imperialism

00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:08,030
like you know this is we know this is

00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,830
good and it's going to be good for you

00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:10,670
maybe you don't know it yourself but we

00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:14,030
are going to help you

00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:18,050
I wonder if and and you and you set

00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:22,310
things like let us put marginalize

00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:25,220
people on on the boards and let us try

00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:28,160
and shape the organization to fit these

00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:30,320
people better but just because there are

00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:33,350
different kinds of marginalized people

00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:35,540
don't doesn't mean they agree on the

00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:38,120
contrary marginalized people fight each

00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:42,560
other to the death in very many areas of

00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:45,950
the planet so maybe maybe it is a bad

00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:48,650
idea to have one organization one

00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:50,630
central organization to run all this one

00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:54,830
OpenStreetMap project maybe there should

00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:57,470
be like smaller federated projects and

00:53:54,830 --> 00:54:00,230
then people could like design locally

00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:03,590
how they want their whatever mapping or

00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:05,570
maybe they don't want any I don't know

00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:09,830
maybe we should go away from this from

00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:11,930
this idea of having the the hot or the

00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:14,930
open street ever or something just say

00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:20,750
you know let's let's try and kind of

00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:23,090
federalize that in some way in a

00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:25,160
personal note I kind of find it very

00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:28,220
comfortable uncomfortable when someone

00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:30,950
says hey you are the map maker David I

00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:32,840
am just a map maker I'm not the map

00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:34,400
maker I think there's some connection to

00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,380
that kind of let's be the hero let's

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,780
let's this is good for you and I am

00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:41,090
trying to unlearn under that that image

00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,600
of the geographer by Johannes Vermeer on

00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:44,570
the left

00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,260
I think that's related to that I agree

00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:47,870
with their point

00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:49,880
what if there's going to be a ministry

00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:53,090
of mapping led by indigenous peoples and

00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:56,380
it's not OpenStreetMap OS I'm a bird who

00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:59,120
covers it that's what I said earlier

00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:00,830
maybe it's not it shouldn't be me who

00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,420
should be making these these maps I

00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:05,540
totally agree with that on a particular

00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:07,430
point a moment when I went to the altar

00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,080
I went to a conference a Maori housing

00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,910
an urban

00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,070
conference funded by my scholarship I

00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:14,560
was so excited I thought the more

00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:16,390
intellectual and activist let's let's do

00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,940
OpenStreetMap in outer oh it's gonna be

00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:21,040
good for everyone and dr. Jenny Lee

00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,350
Morgan said well they will talk to the

00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,450
indigenous people first stopped at the

00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:27,610
Evita try because we have data

00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:30,180
sovereignty we have indigenous data

00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:32,830
sovereignty and on a very fundamental

00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:35,830
worldview level it's different from the

00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:39,040
Western property model the knowledge is

00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:42,610
not privatized it is shared by the group

00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:46,090
some things must remain hidden and this

00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:47,620
is for us some things we will share but

00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:50,440
we have to talk with our elders and the

00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:52,870
whole clan and it takes years to talk

00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,740
about that because in the previous age

00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:59,140
and we were colonized this what they say

00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:02,860
we lost land because those features were

00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:04,000
not so I brought Lee agree with most of

00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,850
the things that you said and thank you

00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,830
for saying thank you for raising it I

00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:11,650
have to closer this custom unfortunately

00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:13,810
and I hope can you get them in the in a

00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:15,160
break sorry for this yeah it's a really

00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:16,810
really amazing discussion I would like

00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,370
to follow on this and please also let us

00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:20,860
know what we can do more from the state

00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:22,600
of the map decides to also make our

00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,160
conference more inclusive so it would be

00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,200
also interested to get your feedback but

00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,970
also all all-over feedback and how we

00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,450
can make this happen thank you so much

00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:30,450
for that I guess

00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:39,979
