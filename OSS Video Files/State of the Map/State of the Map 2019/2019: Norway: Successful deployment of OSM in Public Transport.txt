Title: 2019: Norway: Successful deployment of OSM in Public Transport
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2019
Description: 
	Norway has deployed OSM on a national level for journey planning and is taking initiatives to expand the user, and usage of OSM in Norway and abroad.

Enturâ€™s mission is to enable and increase the use of public transport in Norway. Entur operates the national registry for all public transport in Norway, collecting data from 60 public transportation operators. The registry contains data about 21,000 daily departures on 3,000 routes. This data is open and free of use for app and service developers.

We would very much like to present our success story of using OSM data as the foundation for all interchanges and routing in our national journey planner (used in the app: Entur, and http://en-tur.no), and the surprisingly easy challenges we faced due to the quality of OSM data, and the way we solved the large scale challenges, such as missing roads around the country. Why we are going to continue to build on the usage of OSM, OpenTripPlanner and other open source platforms on a European wide base to create an ever-improving public transport information distribution.

We are actively engaging with the Norwegian community to build relations, improve quality and mapping methods, even arranging beer meetups.

We are of course providing all our data openly, making it easy for OSM to make good use of for example our national stop place database, or for our NeTEx based time table data to be used in innovative solutions.

	00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:15,020
good afternoon and welcome everybody

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,160
I am TD we are going to have a talk by

00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,130
your Hannon Wicklund

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,099
it's going to be on no way successful

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,619
deployment of open data in public

00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:27,390
transport it's going to be a 20 minutes

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:32,369
talk and five minutes for questions

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:35,400
thank you so the the program says or

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,610
some but I want to change it to open

00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:43,739
data because it's more than that it's

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:47,250
not just OSM so I'm from I'm from Sweden

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,480
but I work in Norway and this is my

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,820
company name it's pronounced intoed

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,149
means a trip or a journey or something

00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,020
sir add the identity come back came up

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:05,280
with it so here we can see the wrong

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:09,270
point and my name you want victim Data

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,009
Manager and OpenStreetMap guy so I do

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,090
all the mapping no one else understands

00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:17,670
but mapping is before we start with the

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,979
real things I want to do a little bit of

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,689
backstory because in order we have a

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,729
long tradition of collecting all

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,009
timetabled public transport information

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,850
in one place you can see on the side

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,460
here this is the first edition from 1869

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,750
it had all the steamboat boats and

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,939
trains or almost anyway and the text up

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,680
there actually says I wish we had more

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:46,049
which is exactly what we say now and in

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,869
94 we get digitalization with the

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,710
database and cd-rom version and stuff

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:57,540
for that 2005 we had the first national

00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:01,200
journey planner online and 2016 our

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,060
company was created out of a split and

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,909
merge kind of thing which I won't get

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,040
into now but the goals of this new

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,360
organization which is into it is to

00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:16,200
promote support public transportation

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,060
and to do it in an open way this is

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,010
requirement from the government that you

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:25,860
wanted this by the way this is the

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:29,070
right-wing government I'm just gonna get

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:33,780
into it so first of all what do we do in

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:37,380
OpenStreetMap we invest quite a lot in

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,660
pre-emptive mapping so we don't know

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,130
what's where the problems are but we can

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,520
see that there might be problems in the

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,710
future

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,180
so we have done almost six million edits

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:53,700
already and situation in Norway is that

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:58,140
we have open data government which is

00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:03,209
actively promoting opening datasets for

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,770
public use this includes the orthophotos

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,410
you can see a picture here there's a guy

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:12,810
kicking a football into a goal this is

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:17,640
way up in the north not in the city and

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:21,060
this of course we use along with this is

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,430
not think we have road network as well

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,980
we can import that from the national

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,989
survey company and of course if you

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,900
combine that with perfect aerial photos

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:37,110
which are highly rectified you can

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:38,700
create sort of permanent mapping of

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:48,750
roads you don't need to go back and fix

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:54,090
it again of course the pre-emptive

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:56,190
mapping means that we don't actually

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:02,550
experience that many problems from the

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:06,750
public there's rapidity as well from us

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:10,620
because any time get a reaction we can

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:13,049
of course instantly edit it and as you

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,620
can see it says we are running straight

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,359
of the nightly export from Gear fabric

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:24,350
we are not afraid to use it right away

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:29,120
you know snapshots and in terms of

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,950
a bit last year yeah so we have for

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,650
example here's a visualization which we

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:38,620
use for VMT mapping this is it measures

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:43,730
routing distance versus air distance and

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:52,520
I just used map CSS to visualize it red

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:56,050
and green you know good and bad I want

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:59,390
to get to the problems we have with OSM

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,000
first of all complex areas which is

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:06,170
actually being discussed right now in

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,270
large room by the French from Paris and

00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,580
it has to do with how do you walk across

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,230
this complex area you can see if you

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,310
know the carto you can see that this

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:19,430
highway pedestrian area which is very

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,960
complex and you need a algorithm to sort

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:25,910
of route across that and you have the

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,910
levels and everything and of course a

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:33,910
lot of problem is when you have you want

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:36,590
to wait like how is a path in terms of

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,080
quality for a pedestrian who wants to

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,460
take a bus and then you have in Oslo you

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,460
might have a different situation from

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,580
far up in the north so it's difficult to

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:49,190
map it in the same way I think be easy

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,660
to make a routing engine for a city

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,760
because you can map the whole city in a

00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,100
single way but if you have a huge

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:59,350
country with huge differences in climate

00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,350
even this is going to be a problem

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:07,070
discouraging routing on roads is not a

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,080
problem we have how do you get this

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:14,120
routing to not go into the intersection

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:18,080
and start using the pedestrian paths or

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:21,500
sidewalks instead it's a problem and of

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,020
course the layers when we use OTP right

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,180
now it just puts the coordinates and he

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:32,800
doesn't know which level the person is

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:35,139
on or the stop and this is we had talked

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:40,539
just earlier today in the small room

00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:48,030
about tagging and we kind of see that

00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:50,979
there is oh wait sorry doesn't match so

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,080
when you have our SEM with kind of free

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:55,630
tagging and you suggest you mailing

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,330
lists and stuff it creates this

00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:00,669
flexibility but it also creates the

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,440
problem that there is a bit it's

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,910
difficult to find proper documentation

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,690
in a single place

00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:10,569
it's kind of uneven difficult to find or

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:15,340
rely on this is a problem for us as a

00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:17,169
company because you know you can sort of

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,919
awry rely on it up to a certain point

00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:23,259
but in the last sort of 20% of the

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,030
quality you need it kind of force falls

00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:27,099
short because of the differences in

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:31,810
variations and such so we would like to

00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:35,969
see a more organized effort from osm to

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:42,400
make proper documentation and Moore's

00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:45,280
singular mapping standards so I want to

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:50,909
talk about what my company does as a

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:53,139
whole the bigger picture so we have a

00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:55,719
self-service point for all public

00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,250
transport operators in Norway they are

00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:01,719
required by the government to deliver

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:03,610
their data into this input along with

00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:06,729
real-time feeds and then of course we

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,219
had our SEM there this is done we use

00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:11,050
mainly in ethics but we also use GTFS

00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:13,569
now as this will back up then it's

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,780
packaged and then it comes out at the

00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:18,490
other end as api's and data dumps and

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:22,060
they turn around for this is about one

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:26,380
hour the whole thing which we are part

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,210
of one big part of this package we have

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,729
is this stop point this is top places

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:35,979
which is a single point stop place

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:38,169
database which which is administered by

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,599
these local governments were also

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:43,169
responsible for uploading data we have

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,239
one database so that we can avoid

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:49,389
duplicates

00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:52,629
and so that for example a new user new

00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:55,149
company can simply find their stops that

00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:56,649
I have to map out their own stops just

00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:02,290
go to the database these are our stops

00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:05,230
and the stop is database is also using

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:08,169
the orthophotos I talked about before so

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:12,040
when we map the stops we also use the

00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:18,220
same backdrop to map our SEM so it's

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:20,859
always in synchronization it's also

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,019
available as an API so there's a link

00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:26,319
there you can get my presentation later

00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:32,079
and you can click it and it's a graph QL

00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:34,149
script or API and yes all the stops are

00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:38,529
currently being automatically imported

00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:41,169
into SM by a user it's an automatic

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:46,949
script and it synchronizes our Sam with

00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:49,779
our stops this is the interface for the

00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:51,850
the user interface for the rest of place

00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:56,169
registry so you can see in enter

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:59,279
facilities and names and the red things

00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:05,110
are the exact stop positions which are

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:09,699
underneath a sort of lay collecting

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,199
point like stop place the second part of

00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:15,519
our system that one wanted up but is

00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:17,199
open trip planner because we have we

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,230
started using up a trip planner based on

00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:27,100
what they did in Finland did you transit

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:32,259
so we built on their branch and now we

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:35,199
are also building a coat EP 2.0 which

00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:37,419
has an ethics import so input support

00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:39,999
and the new search algorithm which is

00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,220
faster boots because Norway is too big

00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,369
to use the old one and there's some

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,069
links there too you can click on later

00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:54,309
so I want to talk about why this is good

00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:56,829
for Norway because of course it's not

00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:57,710
cheap to have developers working on this

00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:00,830
building new

00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:05,990
tools and it's like a huge investment

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:09,110
for the government but this is kind of

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:13,310
absorbed later on because what we see

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:16,010
now is that the more and more of the

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:19,430
major operators in Norway are starting

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:21,350
to build their systems on top of our API

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:25,640
instead of building their own systems

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:29,210
so we unify the whole thing and of

00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,540
course that saves a lot of money as a

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,540
whole

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:43,490
yes we are currently handing out 300

00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,310
million search results per month 300

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:50,110
million and this is rising you can see

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,110
this actually graph back here and I made

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,060
fictitious but it's it is growing and

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,560
the more you see like you have that we

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,140
have the biggest one right now at the

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,030
Oslo region they're using it and you can

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:05,060
see more agents like Bergen are starting

00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:13,520
to build and it's gonna snowball get

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:17,750
bigger so when I said it's open data I

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:22,150
wanted to make a little point here it

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,860
actually means that the api's are

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:27,040
completely free to use anyone here

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,710
go to our website find the link and

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,480
build your own search engine right now

00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,550
the only thing require is like a header

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:40,430
so you know whether it's not a random

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:42,410
thing and as well as the open data you

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:49,040
can just go and get our GTFS data

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:51,740
anywhere anytime I mean everything

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,560
almost everything we have in the middle

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:58,190
box there is open source so anyone here

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:03,130
is free to copy our systems use our

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:03,130
front-end backends almost anything

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:12,899
and we use open formats so it's netic

00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:19,230
smiley but we also have GTF at each of

00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:21,839
us and this creates for us the this

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,990
virtuous circle so the more you publish

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,209
data the more access accessible it is so

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,579
it's visible so you get more incentive

00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:36,389
to increase the quality and the content

00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:38,519
amount and I'm pretty much done here so

00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:40,230
I wanted to say I've talked to a lot of

00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,230
people here I've seen and recognized

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,120
most people and we would love for to

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:49,829
have more collaborate collaborators on

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:54,029
our development more users for our data

00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:57,559
and yeah or just copy our stuff and do

00:13:54,029 --> 00:14:02,059
it one thing it's fine as well and

00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:02,059
that's it for me for now

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,819
[Applause]

00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:14,869
also shout out to people back home in

00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:16,419
Norway I know you're watching thank you

00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:18,049
very much your hand for the up

00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:21,679
enlightening talk

00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:25,939
and we would like to have questions yes

00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,559
as many as we can what you why we do the

00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:31,069
questions I can you say that my slide

00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:33,829
also has all these links at the end you

00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:35,959
can just click things yes thank you for

00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:38,299
your presentation we have actually next

00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:40,099
talk also related to public transport

00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:44,059
and my question is I understand you have

00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:46,909
an open API kind of free to use and you

00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:48,859
have and you published etfs data but for

00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:52,069
example we are mostly interested in our

00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:56,209
topic will be about offline routers so

00:14:52,069 --> 00:15:00,349
my question is do you publish data which

00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:03,470
has links between GTFS and osm relation

00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:05,269
ages so it could be built in I don't

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,209
think we have any or some edge

00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:10,669
information in the data as such no it's

00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:14,179
just it builds to a graphic routing

00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:16,459
graph and it's all inside OTP but

00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:20,269
internally you use that map in somehow

00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:21,919
because you use as I understand yes we

00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:23,869
use Open Street Map for Rob do you have

00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,309
this information but it's just not yeah

00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:29,259
I don't think it comes out anywhere now

00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:29,259
how do you think but it probably could

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,009
you mentioned your data processing is

00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:47,790
for the open source

00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:52,060
have you seen cases of parallel use

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:54,160
other users of your code for the same

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,899
sort of processing or is the main

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,990
benefit of open sourcing it the

00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:01,329
transparency the UM for reuse or is

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,949
transparency must leave a goal of

00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:06,009
publishing that code I think it's both

00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:10,769
we want to have more contributors and we

00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,769
want it to be transparent as well so

00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:16,300
well if you use it separately and we

00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:19,300
don't know about it then I guess it's no

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,250
benefit for us but if you contribute if

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,319
you see problems and you point it out to

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,360
us or whatever you know that's a good

00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:27,449
thing we don't have any negative

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:39,370
feelings about using open source stuff

00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:42,010
it is positive sorry

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,709
and since you publish the output already

00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:47,170
all all the outputs are to make all the

00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:49,089
API a public why would anyone replicate

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:54,940
the same system to publish the same

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:57,519
outputs I can't answer that

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,790
have you seen examples of other users

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,199
running it just to know if someone else

00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:07,329
in Norway runs it also in Norway

00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,540
nowadays the base their systems on our

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:12,370
API so they don't use our system so it's

00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:16,919
mostly a transparency thing so that

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,919
everyone can see how it's produced okay

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:33,580
no I was just wondering why isn't

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:47,620
everyone doing this I mean yeah me too

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:49,750
okay questions comments anyone anyway

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,940
I'm gonna be out here some I think I'm

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,020
gonna listen to you next I'm gonna

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:57,310
listen to you talk but I'm gonna be

00:17:53,020 --> 00:18:00,160
outside afterwards okay and I have an

00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:03,190
announcement to make that please before

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,770
you go remember to leave the name tag

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,110
covers so that the in the box provided

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,740
in the foyer thanks everybody for

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:14,039
attending thank you
