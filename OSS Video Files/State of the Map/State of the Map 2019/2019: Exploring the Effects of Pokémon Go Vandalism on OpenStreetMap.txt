Description: 
	This presentation describes the nature and life-cycle of carto-vandalism through a data-driven analysis of harmful edits originated from Pokémon Go players. It also assesses how the OSM community reacts to vandalism.

The utilization of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data by mainstream tech companies has been on the rise in recent years. Two prominent examples are Snapchat and Pokémon Go that became OSM data consumers in 2017. Snapchat [reports](https://bit.ly/2YAzv70) 190 million daily active users in 2019. Pokémon GO was used by 28.5 million users daily during its peak popularity in 2016 and it still managed to engage more than [10 million](https://bit.ly/2VJS3EO) users monthly in 2018. The large user base of these application puts OSM in an unprecedented spotlight which can be considered a huge success for the project. On the other hand, increased attention comes with side effects. Acts of [vandalism](https://bit.ly/2HBLE4R) manifested in the data no longer stay within the OSM community but will be visible to a worldwide audience. This increased visibility of errors caused by malicious actions (e.g. fake place names, fictive data) can potentially undermine the reputation of the OSM project. In August 2018, a case of [anti-semitic vandalism](https://bit.ly/2HHPRno) surfaced on Snapchat's online maps and also made it to various mainstream media outlets, such as the [BBC](https://bbc.in/2JLO4QY), [Time](https://bit.ly/2VJwpkd) or [The New York Times](https://nyti.ms/2onZJJS). Another type of vandalism can be observed in connection with Pokémon Go, where users modify the underlying OSM data by adding [fictional map features](https://bit.ly/2EjFSnD) (e.g. parks, footpaths and lakes) to gain benefits in the game. 

OSM’s vulnerability to vandalism is often considered one of its drawbacks directly related to data quality. Despite this and other negative effects on the OSM project, carto-vandalism [1] has only been addressed sporadically in the literature. One study identified motivations behind such actions [2], while some other studies characterized different types vandalism based on investigations of community forums and mailing lists [1] and documented cases of vandalism [3]. According to Linus’s law, the collaborative nature of OSM ensures that vandalism will be discovered and corrected [4]. However, it is unreasonable to expect that all harmful contributions will be found by community [5], therefore, automatic detection of vandalism with rule-based methods is of interest [3, 6]. The OSM community also developed a set of tools to battle vandalism.

Using Pokémon Go as an example, this study focuses on the nature and life-cycle of harmful edits with an emphasis on the OSM community's response. Based on OSM changeset comments and discussions, the study first identifies Pokémon related vandalism together with changesets that fixed them or reverted them. This duality allows to study not only the act of vandalism itself, but also the community's response. By analyzing changesets committed by Pokémon Go players, the presentation describes in detail what kind of fictive information these players tend add. A better understanding of this will allow to develop more targeted rules for vandalism detection systems. However, it is important to note that not all Pokémon Go players vandalize OSM and some of them are probably valuable members of the OSM community. It is less obvious, though, if those who started their OSM careers as vandals can be converted to real contributors. As OSM relies heavily on its community, this study seeks empirical evidence of vandals converted to OSM contributors. This would help utilizing OSM's increased visibility to engage and retain more contributors. Vandalism directly affects data quality, therefore we provide a first description of the life-cycle of carto-vandalism analyzing a large pool of events and considering both spatial and temporal constraints. Our initial data analysis shows more than 1,000 revert changesets in response to Pokémon Go vandalism. Since OSMappers often revert more than one changeset at once (e.g. https://bit.ly/2YC7U5f), this number corresponds to more vandalism cases in reality. This provides sufficient amounts of data for our investigation.

the next presentation is about exploring

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,410
the effects of

00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:29,800
vandalism on USM and it's being

00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:32,970
presented by tatio Novak please for my

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,640
part as this is my current leaving town

00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,390
participated in this work together with

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,480
three researchers from different

00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:44,129
universities in Florida the first author

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,629
being La Venta you have he's part of the

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,760
organizing committee of the academic

00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:51,579
track and it's my pleasure and honor to

00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,809
be here and present this book yeah I'm

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,660
going to talk about the heavenlies

00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:58,719
Pokemon and lo SM and how these things

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,190
related Mallis so this is my outline for

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,890
today pretty standard I start with an

00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,170
introduction then methodology results

00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,720
and then I'll wrap it up summary and

00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,270
future work and I'll start by saying

00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,759
three words about Pokemon and how it

00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,369
relates both to constructive mapping and

00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,350
vandalism in OSM then I'll present the

00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:20,250
goal of our work and then move on to the

00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,250
methodology and so on

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,890
so yeah Pokemon is augmented reality

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:31,450
mobile game you play with your

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:33,910
smartphone and go is to local locate and

00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:38,319
capture those virtual creatures and

00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:40,000
those virtual flying monsters and by

00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,030
playing it you are required to go to

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,539
different places in the map and collect

00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,819
points capture those creatures there's

00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:51,970
you can also interact with other players

00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:54,580
and so it's a really interactive game

00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:59,440
both with the environment and with with

00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:02,349
other people and the thing is that it

00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,950
has a really high popularity even today

00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:08,319
at its peak of popularity in 2016 it had

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,720
almost 30 million different users

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,810
playing it every day and so today there

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,370
are roughly 10 million people playing it

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,230
and what you see in this picture there

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,250
is a so-called Jim I think it's where

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:23,439
people get together to battle against

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,920
stronger pokemons and extra and also to

00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:32,020
exchange points and do all sorts of

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:34,000
interactions in the game and I really

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,280
wouldn't have anything I guess against

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,489
it except that there's one so called

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,400
genes right beside my office I took this

00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,959
picture on Wednesday and it's ironic

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,630
because they were really disturbing me

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:53,550
as I was trying to prepare this

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:56,319
presentation and but they are not just

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,290
negative aspects from the game there are

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,890
also a lot of positive ones as well so

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,420
there are plenty of evidence that

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,450
Pokemon planes associated with altered

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,940
or activity so with physical activity it

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,799
also is known to increase local

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,810
businesses because after all these

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:18,280
people are buying seems to drink or

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:21,540
whatever as they play and it turned out

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,280
that result that it actually inspired

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,080
different citizen science projects right

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,019
so I brought this article here from

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,720
nature where it says that scientists are

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:36,609
urging Pokemon players to keep an eye on

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,220
potential new species and just this may

00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:42,400
be transforming existing taxonomy and

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:47,320
another very representative example is

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:50,680
photo photo photo quest goal which is a

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,750
citizen science project and application

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,019
for collecting land use and land cover

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:59,650
data and it has a gamification and

00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:08,079
community principles just as Pokemon go

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:13,510
has so om is the background map from

00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:17,859
from Pokemon and the players of discover

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:20,890
that spawn points these are where points

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:23,620
where Pokemon creatures appear are

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:26,889
influenced by certain features of the

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,930
map so they started the communication in

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:32,770
specialized forums you see on the left

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:36,849
hand side and also dedicated websites

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:40,440
for for gaming sometimes post articles

00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:44,289
with instructions on how

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,530
and so potentially there's a new

00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:50,229
community of constructive mappers that

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,199
kink that can come from from from

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:58,690
Pokemon players because the idea is that

00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:01,810
by inserting non inserting futures on

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,780
the map that influence the appearance of

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,520
those those creatures they will both

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,770
contribute to the map as well as get

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,090
advantage by collecting the appearing

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:15,430
creatures that will appear on the

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:18,310
features that they are inserting as I

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:23,080
said I mean the the OSM community seems

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:27,370
to welcome this potential large mass of

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:30,009
new mappers just attested by a page from

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,680
osm wiki where it says all the flurry of

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:35,380
new mapping editing activity coming from

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,849
Pokemon the players have discovered that

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,349
there's association of Pokemon

00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:42,509
appearance and certain features of the

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:46,330
map and it also instruct mappers or

00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:49,180
players I should say to map correctly

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:57,690
and not insert in existing things just

00:05:49,180 --> 00:06:00,280
to get advantage in the game so but

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:03,370
unfortunately there is not just

00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,039
constructive mapping emerging from

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:10,120
Pokemon players but also vandalism by

00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,770
this the topic of my my talk here today

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,190
what you see in this picture is a very

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:18,970
extreme example because footpaths are

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,550
especially associated with those spawn

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:25,300
points where Pokemon creatures appear

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:29,289
and this user inserted I know hundreds

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,889
of footpaths in in worship Park area

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:36,280
vegetated area just to get advantage

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:37,960
from it and also certain Pokemon

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,909
creatures are associated so land use

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,370
types for instance there are certain

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:45,370
monsters or creatures that appear in

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:49,180
lakes so people will map swimming pools

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:51,310
as lakes they might map forests as a

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,870
park just so that these creatures will

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,770
field

00:06:51,870 --> 00:07:00,270
they will be able to collect them so

00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:07,350
this is the underlying cause of Pokemon

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:10,460
related vandalism in OSM of course

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:13,650
vandalism is a important topic because

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:17,250
it kind of undermines the reputation of

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:19,380
OSM brought this example where a vandal

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:24,570
actually changed the name of New York to

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:29,580
do trophyless and somehow map service

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:32,250
there are based on on netbox showed the

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:36,000
map with instead of the name New York

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:38,370
Joe propolis and that looks really bad

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,170
so our images so we should definitely

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:45,170
put efforts in avoiding situations and

00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:52,260
so when inspection is important thing

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,550
especially because according to Linda's

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,200
law any type of vandalism or bugs will

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,530
eventually be corrected but it's

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,930
unlikely that all harmful edits will be

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:11,640
detected and at least in a short period

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:16,080
of time so there is some related work on

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,870
vandalism in in osm the OSM wiki for

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:24,720
instance provides those who are

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:27,320
reverting suspicious editing and also

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,680
provides guidelines on how to manage

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:35,700
vandalism and it also provides a few

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,610
suggestions on how to detect vandalism

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:42,660
but these are mostly very simple rule

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:47,670
based strategies and and that not always

00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:49,500
works and so and this taken into

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,620
consideration for instance very long tag

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,240
names or very new users that produce a

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,340
lot of edits and a short period of time

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,190
or change sets with a very large number

00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,860
of edits so these are hints that these

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:06,959
are probably changed

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:10,170
that are disrupting and then I train in

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,110
academic literature there's also a few

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,360
papers on that the paper from La Scala

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,209
is continues to be a reference from my

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,100
perspective I will not get much into

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:25,380
that because a time limitation here so

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,860
I'll move on to the Gopher work which

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,750
was really to undertake some first

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:34,470
exploratory analysis on what we say is

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:37,740
the nature and life cycle of Pokemon go

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:41,550
related vandalism but also to focus on

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:48,810
how the OSM community respond to to such

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:52,140
cases of vandalism so going on to the

00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:56,940
metal methodology what we did we use the

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:59,730
chain set dump to get all the existing

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,160
change sets and mail until now and we

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,279
applied this search string on it so what

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:10,140
you see here so pokemon pokemon okay our

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:12,899
stems and and and on the other side of

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,570
the end operator you see three verbs and

00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:20,550
because these are stamps regardless of

00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:23,699
the verb tense of this works in the

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:26,850
comments of the chain sets we will get

00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:29,670
those change sets as as our data so

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:32,399
demonstrate how it works so we apply

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:37,079
this search string and in altering sets

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,120
and then we will collect a few chain set

00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:41,310
so this this would be one case there's a

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,410
comment there says reverted change set

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,940
blah blah and parts of change a table

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,740
because of pokemon vanilla so it

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,910
contains these themes we are we are

00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:55,740
using another search stream and then we

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:58,680
look for eight digits integers in those

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,399
comments to detect the chain sets that

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:05,160
are being fixed or corrected reverted as

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,230
you wish to call it right so in this

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,529
case we will collect then those two

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:13,699
change sets so we have them both the

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:18,209
fix it change sets and evangelism ones

00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:21,599
another approach that we applied in case

00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:23,309
there was no indication of the change

00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:26,279
sets that were being corrected at the

00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:29,249
comments we took a look at the previous

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:32,039
versions of all the edits that were made

00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:34,769
and in the case that all those edits

00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:38,369
came from a single change set then we

00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:41,219
used that as well in our in our analysis

00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:42,779
so in case those edits are coming from

00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:45,479
different change sets then there were no

00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:48,689
way to know which one was from vanilla's

00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:50,909
which one was another type of valid

00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:55,939
chain set so we discarded those cases

00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:58,829
altogether so we have now then is a

00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:01,859
large group of chain set categorizing to

00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:04,229
vandalism fixes and we have their

00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:07,199
respective users or creator of solution

00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:13,739
sets which we also tagged as vandals and

00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:17,519
fixers so this is our database actually

00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:19,289
so we got pretty much all data that you

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,149
can get with the main API from the

00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:23,009
change sets from the users and from the

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,049
edits or from the change sets as I said

00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:27,509
we categorize them into fix and

00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:31,439
vandalism we also save the team's

00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:34,129
timestamp the user ID tags number of

00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:37,979
changes etc we created a network

00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:40,499
connecting fixing the chain sex to of

00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:43,019
vandalism change sets and that allow us

00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:45,869
among other things to calculate the time

00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:52,289
difference between a vandalism act and

00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:54,179
its respective repair from the users we

00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:56,269
categorize them as vandals and fixers as

00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:59,609
I said we collect also the age which is

00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:02,459
the time since the creation of the

00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:04,079
account in osm also computed a neighbor

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,079
of change sets those user creators

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:11,209
number of edits and so on and from the

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:14,879
edits we categorize them into creation

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:20,009
modification a deletion and we are

00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,940
currently working on saying what type of

00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:25,000
future is being edit and for there

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:27,670
fear is in this Joe Johnson presets but

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,850
this is ongoing work which will allow us

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:38,320
to assess what what features are the

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:40,750
object of finally is being in OS M so as

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,480
I said we categorized the users into

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,070
manuals and fixers but it turns out that

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,900
things are a little bit more complex

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,900
than that so we've seen this case here

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:52,270
the same user appears a tad vandalism at

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,650
first on the left hand side and if he's

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,470
not really a beginner because has

00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,930
already and nineteen chainset edited and

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:03,940
then nine changesets

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:06,640
after that he or she was actually

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,310
detected as correcting another gene set

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,270
so this is probably a case of someone

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:15,690
that acted at least in some occasion as

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:20,290
a vandal and turn out to be actually

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:23,820
someone that's five minutes better rush

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:26,770
that's correcting those those skills so

00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,750
going on to the results here so what you

00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,430
see on the first two graphs above are

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,120
the first one is the monthly number of

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:38,860
of change sets indentified as vandal is

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:41,380
in orange and fixes there off and on the

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,460
middle this is the number of monthly

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,990
users engaged in vandalism and fixes so

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:51,820
it's very interesting to see those Peaks

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:54,970
here in the in the time axis and we

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:58,090
assume this is related somewhat to map

00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:00,730
updates from from from Pokemon so every

00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:04,060
time the math gets updated some of the

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,290
vandalism attacks get deleted they get

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,580
because they get corrected by a

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:11,320
community so that triggers vandals to

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,890
act in vandalism against so that they

00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,620
get advantage once again in the game and

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,480
the last graph here shows that this is

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,300
the cumulative number of users engaged

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,950
in vandalism fixes and so the number of

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,950
people fixing it

00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,280
relatively steady here meaning that

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,600
these are the same people actually

00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,880
engaging in correct in the cases where

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,220
else the cases of vandalism the number

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,420
of users in engage in vandalism tends to

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:43,040
grow with time so this is a graph

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,520
showing add a number of analyze and

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,250
change sets by the time taken to and

00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,140
correct them in our so most cases get

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,700
corrected actually in the first few

00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:56,270
hours but there are cases that take a

00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,790
long time to be corrected and but 50

00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:03,880
percent is corrected in less than 8

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:05,810
hours and average time is 90 days and

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,730
two out of three times

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:13,580
share of three of those twin sets are

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:17,510
fixed within one day so you see the

00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:20,360
lines here are kernel density estimation

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:24,520
gray areas are the confidence of

00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:28,190
interval and the green area stands for

00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,830
the average time takes to fix the

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,690
vandalism change set and the orange line

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,850
stands for the vandalized

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,340
change set so there is an inverse

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,600
relationship here meaning that at times

00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,280
where you have lots of cases of

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,110
vandalism the community speaks in those

00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,860
really really quickly whereas when you

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:48,050
have little cases or few cases then

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:54,520
community is mostly focusing on

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:54,520
correcting older cases of vandalism

00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:02,560
these two breaths here show a

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:05,839
correlation of time and and time to take

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,329
time taken to correct the vandalism X so

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:12,709
here in this case you have single cases

00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:14,360
of vandalism and and how much time it

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,000
took them in the community to correct

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,280
them and this is the decreasing line so

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,350
there's a negative correlation here and

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,199
this is statistically significance which

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,940
allow us to say that the time thing to

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,850
discover those and fix those when these

00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,530
acts are is actually decreasing same

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,710
thing on the right hand side here this

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,230
is average bite month and

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:39,880
it's a negative correlation and is

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:43,029
statistically significant so this is the

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,340
amount of users engaging in in vandalism

00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:48,669
in time so most of them are first-time

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:51,250
vandals were else on the right hand side

00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:54,399
you have the number of people correcting

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,899
it and most of them are returning users

00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:58,000
so do these are the same guys that

00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:01,200
corrected vandalism before they continue

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,520
to act as fixers of mendel in the case

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,130
so as I showed before the number of

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,770
vandals is constantly increasing whereas

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:16,799
the name of users correct in it its

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:21,850
stadium vandals are usually very young

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:24,010
users so 50% of them have created their

00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,980
accounts in less than 35 minutes before

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:30,909
they engage in disruptive editing where

00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:32,500
our fixes are there for five years more

00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,630
or less so you see that on the

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,539
distributions here so the distribution

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,700
of the fixers is much more we have

00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:44,710
distributed much more even whereas this

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:47,460
one is much tailed a second so these

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:51,730
regards they added her software users so

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:53,890
vandals are editing using mostly their

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,929
IDs or the most standard way whereas

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,669
fixers are using more sophisticated

00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:00,220
tools which demonstrates that there are

00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:04,690
more experienced and know how to handle

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:07,890
those tools to fix vandalism cases we

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:12,010
also inspected discussions between

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:14,200
vandals and fixers so there are cases

00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,630
where there is pretty constructive and

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,340
civilized discussion which indicates

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:21,039
that some sandals are actually

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,720
transformed into constructive mappers

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:28,000
after you get approached by the

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:32,820
community so are going on to the summary

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,100
and future work then wrapping it up then

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:38,100
let's say the OSM community seems to be

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,799
getting better at discovering vandalism

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,610
vandalism is not sustained by the same

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,970
by the same you

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:49,559
but always from different ones fixes are

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:55,420
sustained by a dedicated small community

00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:57,850
and communication is helpful and we are

00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,670
now working towards a detection

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:03,610
mechanism to to identify vandalism case

00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:08,049
in an automatic way in a very time

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:11,410
effective way so for future work we

00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:14,910
intend to consider an explorer or the

00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:18,370
matrix as I said to formalize a binary

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:22,780
classifier for detecting vandalism and

00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:24,700
then to extend our findings to other

00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:29,350
cases of vandalism and not just Pokemon

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:33,090
go yeah that was short Pat thank you

00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,090
very much all right thank you very much

00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,770
we have about three minutes for Question

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,570
Time

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:48,150
and then afterwards there's gonna be an

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:49,920
exchange of if of sessions so we have

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,160
two mics one is there so just raise your

00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,160
hand

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,730
thanks that was really interesting it

00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,380
looks like there were two big spikes in

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:03,120
the vandalism do you know what those big

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:07,800
spikes correspond to yes that's a very

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,870
good question not able to provide a

00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,800
definitive answer but I think they are

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:15,600
related to updates made by Niantic is

00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,660
the company that runs pokemon go so

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,700
every time it updates the map because

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,470
the vendor is an ex get corrected by the

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,040
community so the disappeared from the

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,870
Pokemon go map I assume that vandals

00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:32,130
engaged in vandalizing again so that

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:37,140
they regain their advantages this is one

00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:39,060
apart is that we have but an yeah and

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,590
it's nice to know that there are all

00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,660
these peaks because you can concentrate

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,150
element when those peaks happens so you

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,530
can concentrate on those when trying to

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:53,780
detect vandalism eggs automatically

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:56,100
thank you anymore okay you have one here

00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,110
do you know how many of the Vandals were

00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,520
actually malicious two versus the people

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,950
who actually didn't know that they were

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,170
doing anything wrong sort of just came

00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,440
in there and thought that it's okay to

00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:11,940
do something like this

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:14,250
yeah that happens I try to show that

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,790
because lack of time I had to rush it

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:22,410
but exactly some of them didn't really

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:25,550
know they were well districts destroying

00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:29,580
things so once they get approached they

00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:31,740
yeah eventually became constructive map

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,990
or so you can look at the presentation

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,020
afterwards but there's one dialogue here

00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:39,720
where person from the community says

00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,880
okay correct that please and the guy

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,890
says okay sorry I corrected that and all

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,350
next time I use this link as an

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,580
instruction to map it correctly and said

00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,460
you know thank you

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,830
so that happens a lot and I'm

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,690
generalizing and calling everyone vandal

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,009
here but of course there are many

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,730
different cases and many different

00:22:56,009 --> 00:23:04,110
motivations for people to provide false

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:07,409
information okay thank you very much

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:09,869
are there more questions oh we have

00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:14,059
another am I considered okay

00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:14,059
please let me cause a different person

00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:21,570
I'm Kari from Brazil finally what is

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,879
your perception do you think that

00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,029
Pokemon population and community is

00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:30,149
likely to provide good mappers for 4sm

00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:34,340
or you are not very much inside yes

00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:34,340
you're not enthusiastic at all about it

00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:45,330
and we get dedicated especially to that

00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:48,119
and if you see the narrative on that on

00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:51,269
that page is it goes in the direction

00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:53,369
okay we've seen a bunch of you coming so

00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:56,190
be welcome and just make sure that you

00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:59,509
met correctly so that's my perception of

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:03,509
it and probably the majority of Pokemon

00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:04,710
mappers are called that way is doing is

00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:06,690
contributing actually they are

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,749
constructive mappers but there there are

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:12,210
a few of them which is actually

00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:14,519
destroying it yeah but here you see our

00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:19,799
search string was Pokemon and then

00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:22,409
revert reconstruct so probably if we

00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:24,419
have chosen another search string we

00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:26,730
will detect those cases of constructive

00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:32,789
map being related to Pokemon players

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:34,529
coming from okay okay thank you I'll

00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:37,950
allow one more question and then we can

00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:40,230
close please so just a quick question

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,350
again so it seems like there's

00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:45,929
definitely a use case for a layer called

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,850
Pokemon go somewhere and I don't think

00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,440
like I think people just want to take

00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:54,539
advantage of the great tools we have for

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,759
osm for their own specific cases so is

00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:58,960
there a recommendation how they can use

00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:03,580
them to build their own custom layers

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:14,789
things not sure I got the question

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:21,010
correctly this it's kind of I think you

00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:29,649
met perhaps as a layer custom layer on

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:31,179
top of OpenStreetMap okay I guess it's

00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:33,820
more of a comment than a question isn't

00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:35,950
it yeah yeah exactly

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,669
okay so yeah the question is answered

00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:46,020
thank you very much so let's give you

00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:46,020
