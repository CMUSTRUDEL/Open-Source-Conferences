[Music]

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,590
it's nice to have a chair but I get a

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,340
bit emotional because of this is the

00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:29,650

00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:42,550
I may not see for a year or more so you

00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:45,160
may be honest the hot-looking theory but

00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:49,000
I've got some exciting announcements a

00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,130
few things to talk about also some of

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,280
you may know from other states of the

00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:57,880
maps that you know it's not over until

00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,250
the loud matter sings I'm just gonna

00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:06,119
tell you my audio cables plump in and

00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:08,890
we'll see what happens at the end say

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:13,840
can anyone tell me where states of the

00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:14,290
map was in 2008 Limerick in Ireland are

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,600
good

00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,369
Pete hand up if you were there it was my

00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,890
first state of the map we've got one

00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:23,020
side one two three four five six of us

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,330
that's cool you can maybe spot them

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,549
there there's a few people drinking

00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:31,420
enough they - it was much smaller and

00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:36,189
more casual and so I want to invite

00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:38,080
Dermot to come up because Dermot you

00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:39,460
were there in sorry I should get back

00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:45,400
do you know where you are you in the

00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:51,270
photo yeah we kind of hidden behind my

00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:55,630
separate yeah oh that's nice

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:58,630
so yes demet was there and don't shake

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,640
my Poland it's a OpenStreetMap community

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,369
like covers and you sent me some photos

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,460
that you do different things organize

00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:11,829
events and projects which maybe you're

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:15,020
part of a t-shirt which that's some

00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:17,970
state of the map he you it's in

00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:24,000
yes sorry I should have I didn't expect

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:27,360
them to speak but he's also you would

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,770
poet laureate of state the best my

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,180
understanding I'm still poet laureate

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,120
because there hasn't been another poetry

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,100
competition since Amsterdam

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,650
so yeah I'm constraint that communities

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,270
I mean I think if you are in a

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,880
constraint knuckle what you all are by

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,770
being here then having you have a

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,110
community it may be small it may be

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:50,250
large it makes some of these things that

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:54,000
I think my volunteer be organized

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,470
different things and it's great that we

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,459
have this formality there's the

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,880
OpenStreetMap

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:02,550
foundation which represents

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,620
OpenStreetMap and runs the official

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,590
website and some of the official servers

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,160
and runs this conference and we have a

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,860
local chapter kind of framework to say

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,950
ah there's an organization in this area

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,739
at the world they are representing

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,650
OpenStreetMap in that area might mean

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:26,489
myself I'm part of OpenStreetMap UK

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:29,760
which is kind of your neighbor and so

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:33,989
I'm quite excited we we do overlap with

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,920
our remit because of political

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:39,510
situations but we won't go into but and

00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,080
because of different organizations that

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,760
overlap anyway we overlap in in our in

00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,790
overlaps with yours which is very

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,640
exciting but you know we want you to be

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,739
an official I presume that foundation

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,459
local chapter you've been working on

00:03:52,739 --> 00:04:00,060
that creating a formal organization

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,640
that's registered in Ireland and so if I

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,519
can write down some of the agency

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,110
Foundation board members and there yes

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,500
it's gonna come just the water than my

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,890

come on Frederick what I'm free of here

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:21,150
it's a nice odd number which is saying a

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,430
pub methods so you today on this spot

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,090
open suit my fatherland is going to

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,330
become a local chapter

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,210

house I haven't seen this yeah yeah

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,990
you've probably seen this agreement hunt

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:47,000
and you probably know better what I'm

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,000

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,990
two to sign anything without reading it

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,770
or at least ashore did you know licenses

00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:00,139
are important to us I would I would like

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,030
to think that you guys know what is in

00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:05,030
the local chapter agreement anyway I'm

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:08,630
afraid it as this isn't the first local

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,790

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,880
we'll get some photos of you guys

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:16,850

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,270
help you out and the wiki's got more

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,390
information about that and the

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,120
foundation website

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,120
[Applause]

them to get you company into my house

00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:21,810
well if you pay for the electricity we

00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,960
could maybe hold some servers there I

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,180
don't know yeah we'll be saying in the

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,590
EU for anyone who gets confused about

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,419
these things so maybe maybe that maybe

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:35,009
that'll help cool so yeah talk to talk

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,159
to these guys if you're interested about

00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:40,500
what being a local chapter means and I

00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,599
think the very thing to talk to you even

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,990
if it's at early stages and to answer

00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:47,969
your questions you can be member of our

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,580
like the chapter you can also be a

00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:52,529
member of the Foundation which is great

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,990
if there isn't a formal local chapter in

00:06:52,529 --> 00:07:06,090
your area I encourage you to go to the

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:09,060
website how did that happen I encourage

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,009
you to go to that website you're new

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,919
become a foundation I really hope it

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:16,440
doesn't do that on the other slide so

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,870
let's move on to this then and I want to

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,000
say well done to everyone that was

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,550
nominated for an Open Street Map Award

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,830
we have the ceremony earlier in the

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:29,279
conference so there are the winners of

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,770
the awards and their nominees you've

00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,050
done great stuff you can look at the

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:37,860
website if you want to know more details

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,330
about why they were nominated and I

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,310
think if you know them going to

then we'll do clap at the end we've got

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,760
the state of the map core working very

00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,680
people like Christine and a few others

00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,180
of us look at the names thank them if

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,320
you know them go and thank them in

00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:46,150
person we have say they really help

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,490
throughout the year and choosing the

00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,230
conference we've got the local team that

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,480
knew the area knew the venue

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,730
knew where we could have a good social

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,710
and things like I knew where we could

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,280
find some students to brew our first

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:02,710
conference beer we've got the academic

00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,370
committee that really understand the

00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:08,740
academic world the research body and so

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,170
they were able to review those sessions

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:15,370
that were proposed to make sure their fi

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:18,010
quality just as the kind of wider

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,820
program selection committee did make

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:24,250
sure we had high quality interesting

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:27,310
talks that were new material and new

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:30,880
people speaking as well as experienced

00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:33,070
people that you got to hear and we have

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,290
the video recording and streaming team

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,420
because if you missed a talk there were

00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,650
so many great tracks you'll be able to

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,110
go and look at the ones that were

00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,750
recorded maybe you went to talk and you

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,550
want to watch it again I know I do and I

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,810
want to share with friends so thank you

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,570
for them they've been really helpful

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,880
with their equipment and when things

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:55,150
when some of us less able that

00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:58,150
technology you needed help and there's

00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,280
some special thanks that they think on a

00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:03,190
team but we got Dorothea

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:06,690
he's the administer for the foundation

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:09,390
we like to use her time a lot

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:12,600
in group so she's particularly helped

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:16,740
with the scholarships and their visas so

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:20,240
people could come Frederic Ram he's the

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,800
treasurer on the board is really helpful

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,470
just about kind of finance because

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,570
obviously there's a lot of money coming

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,640
and going and it probably causes some

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,670
headache

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,470
Ilia who we wanted to have Awards a few

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,120
years ago and it never happened and

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,150
because we're too busy running the

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,010
conference so Ilya thank you for I love

00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,870
that they now happen every year and

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:47,880
that's why I included the names in

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:49,710
earlier on Rachel who helped with the

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,660
hot summit and was working on that

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,450
because if some of you might have gone

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,430
to that in the dates before this one so

00:13:54,450 --> 00:14:00,060
it was really great to have a connection

00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:03,060
on both teams doing that and things like

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,970
just moving so you had Express

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:08,610
registration and you know we knew things

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:12,000
would be clear and we didn't duplicate

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:15,810
effort we could reuse things like the

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,620
names ideas and Tom Hughes who helps

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:21,510
with the operations working group and

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,230
kind of things like the website and

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,390
systems and all these people in their

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,700
own thing even these people stood up

00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,100
here they helped with little bit because

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,050
there's lots of things that if we had to

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,970
do them all sometimes we just need to

00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:39,720
find someone can you sort this out and

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,820
come back to me with the details or oh I

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,170
think we've both got this covered one

00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,520
person could do it can you get to the

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,790
other room where they're short on people

00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:50,220
they've been really great we've had some

00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:53,730
of you guys are on the Erasmus mapping

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,700
program it's been great to see you and

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,170
have your help as well so so that's all

00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,180
the things but as I said there are names

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,940
in the booklet please thank them

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,230
individually if you see them and for all

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,670
those people and groups I mentioned

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,840
another round of applause please

00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,900
[Applause]

00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,900
[Music]

00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,900
yeah

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,200
so it just very quick from the local

00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:25,580
team also thank you all for attending

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,640
without you the conference would be

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:31,779
would exist I hope you had a great time

00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:36,230
make new friends learn something new and

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:37,880
yeah just had a good time so as he

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,680
already said it's of course a lot of

00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,290
work to organize such a conference and I

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,029
would say that without support from the

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:47,089
organization committee the local team

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:50,100
couldn't have made it and just a small

00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:53,179
gift from us to

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,179
[Music]

00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:02,029
[Applause]

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,029
[Music]

00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,409
thank you guys I'll let you go back to

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:16,749
your seats something you don't like even

00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:21,749
being at the run you have thank you more

00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:24,399
thank yous so these people are great I

00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:26,829
don't have to spank the sponsors you

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,159
know they didn't pay for me to include

00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:33,999
them in the closing but they do enable

00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:36,159
us to keep ticket prices low

00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:38,049
we need these volunteers but you know

00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:41,349
there's things like catering and the

00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:43,629
venue higher and also we have a

00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:46,479
scholarship program for people that need

00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:48,069
a city financial assistance with whether

00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:51,899
that be flights or flights and

00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:55,809
accommodation and without the sponsors

00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:58,839
we wouldn't yeah we wouldn't be able to

00:16:55,809 --> 00:17:01,179
do that it just would be a bit beyond us

00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:05,289
or you your ticket price will probably

00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:08,679
be far too expensive for me to ever have

00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:10,959
started coming say thank you to them

00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:14,789
that's the the main sponsors up there

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,789
and some of the other ones

00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:20,920
[Applause]

00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,920
[Music]

00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:32,590
and that was a blank slide which

00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:35,590
confused me but what does it take so

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:38,140
this is the design of the logo in his

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,580
iteration hopefully you now know it's

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,400
you've maybe gone to the bridge where

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,980
there's the brass monkey which the logos

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,800
based on if not you can check that out

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,260
later and there's some dates here I took

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,250
on a you know it starts in March you

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:57,430
might think when when the call for

00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,700
venues comes out we have a public call

00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:03,800
asking who wants to host which community

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,440
once stakes of the map to come to them I

00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:11,240
would say it actually starts before

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,770
March because we need as you saw how

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,750
many volunteers there were and that

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:18,350
really was involved with all the tiers

00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:21,380
and you can look at all the names and

00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:24,920
they really helped too and so we need

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:27,470
people locally we need people with

00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,150
experience of running an event so I

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,940
would say if you want state of the map

00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:35,240
to come and to come to your local

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:39,170
matters which I think you should that

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:42,770
actually run a smaller event running a

00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:50,410
city state of the map run a country one

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:53,330
or a regional we hear about these murthy

00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,490
we hear you know there's oh there's lots

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,340
of events going on like state of the

00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,810
matthew state of the map Asia they're

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,230
not the international one they're not

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:05,210
run by the foundation as such but you

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,370
can get in touch with us the state of

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,950
the map team are details on the

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:14,090
foundation website or on the conference

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,440
website and you can so you can get in

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,230
touch with us and we'll help you and

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,910
we've got some notes that we built up

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,740
over the years on how to run a good

00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:24,620
event and I would say that's a great way

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,020
to start and then you can think about

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,800
hmm

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:32,470
2021 maybe we'll have a state of the map

00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,480
2022 maybe we'll host it

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,340
but if you think that then that means

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,190
you've got time to run an event we can

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:42,720
see that you've got experience as a

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:46,270
local team we can see you've got

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,020
experience running an event and to know

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,780
how that went

00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,510
and then we can help talk to you about

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,940
how you could scale that so really it's

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:59,350
much better if before March next year

00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:02,230
you get in touch with us before that but

00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:06,510
I kind of missed the year there didn't I

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:11,500
I kind of missed 2020 which is next year

00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:15,510
say yes so we we did the call for venues

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:19,540
2020 it took a bit of time we didn't get

00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:22,390
responses straightaway because yeah this

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:25,390
is why it's good to plan early and start

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:28,180
thinking about it even two years before

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,880
if you want to do that but we did decide

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,250
where we had some contact with people

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,710
after the deadline closed and and then

00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,300
we had the decision to make still and

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,950
you can see I'm really building up to

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,600
this and I get really excited because I

00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,630
have to figure out where I'm putting my

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:47,980
main holiday each year and say if we

00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:50,850
have a drumroll please in 2020 state of

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,620
the map will be in

00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:58,749
Cape Town

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:58,749
[Applause]

00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,300
so they were the days if you need to

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,490
tell your boss that you need the time

00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,530
off holiday or you need to tell you boss

00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,250
that he's going to pay for you to go to

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:23,020
the conference and start you know

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:25,120
sweet-talking him now maybe gonna buy a

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:28,570
state of the map beer from outside and

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:34,090
take that back to him but if you've got

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:36,010
a if you if you've if you're here you're

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:39,750
a delegate you're on the mailing list so

00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:43,690
once we sorting out more details which

00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:47,650
tends to come around Christmas New Year

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:50,920
time when we've built up and put more

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:54,130
things in place then we'll send an email

00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:56,260
to the delegates of this year if you

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,870
didn't come here so you're watching the

00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,580
live stream or one of these people is

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,440
gonna go back and tell their friends

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,320
that you should come to state of the map

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,000
2020 then they can go to the State of

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,610
the mat website that's on the bottom

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,840
there and there's an email signup for

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:17,830
update so we will reuse that for for

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,660
next year so so not now and so we're

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:22,360
defense you know maybe South Africa's

00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:25,800
far away for it for you maybe July is

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,820
far away for you there are lots of

00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,490
OpenStreetMap events and you really

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,810
can't read this because there's so many

00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:35,080
which is why I put the address up there

00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,580
current offense so looking at the flags

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:41,530
we've got things happening all over

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:45,400
Germany Japan France UK I won't try and

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:48,580
identify every flag but yeah there's

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,680
stuff happening in your area if not see

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:56,140
what sort of events happen and organize

00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:59,320
one and keep mapping and encouraging

00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:06,190
each other in what OpenStreetMap work

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:10,270
you do meanwhile say if you've got a

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:13,180
name badge we actually the holders for

00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,880
these were used for conference and then

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,330
they got returned and were reused for

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,960
the hot summit and they

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:23,450
returned and we reuse them for this

00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,890
conference because you know we care

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:28,930
about the environment and we're

00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:31,550
recycling and so will your name badge

00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:33,200
there's a big blue box by the Welcome

00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:36,170
Desk if you could take it before you

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,640
leave dropped it in there and that will

00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:40,430
be really helpful because it can be

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,550
passed on to another conference and we

00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:47,960
can reduce plastic waste and things like

00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:51,770
that if you what help with your travel

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,130
information gain somewhere up at the

00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:58,370
Welcome Desk they have a screen with the

00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:00,830
upcoming train times I think and they've

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,620
got printouts of the schedules

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:06,140
they've also there's some local

00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:09,620
expertise there don't ask me how to use

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:12,980
the travel system in Heidelberg or or

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:16,310
you know what's good they'll be much

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:18,080
better and also you could maybe ask them

00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,480
if you're staying around where should I

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,990
go what should I do and now have

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:27,700
recommendations so we're ending this

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:32,390
conference at the end of this next piece

00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:35,330
the conference will end when it reaches

00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:37,610
zero on the counter so the team would

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:43,550
like to start packing down particular in

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:45,500
this room and the other rooms say yes so

00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,480
please you can go up to the foyer and

00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:53,030
talk to each other and plan your on wood

00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:58,720
travels and do that and hopefully the

00:24:53,030 --> 00:25:01,610
sun's gonna run on this it's not me and

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,590
