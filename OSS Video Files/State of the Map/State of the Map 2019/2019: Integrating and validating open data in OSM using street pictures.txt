Title: 2019: Integrating and validating open data in OSM using street pictures
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2019
Description: 
	Pic4Review now helps contributors to integrate open data properly in OpenStreetMap using street pictures validation. Discover the way it works and how this can help improve both OSM and open datasets.

[Pic4Review](http://pic4review.pavie.info/) is a new editor to work on OpenStreetMap using open street-level pictures offered by Mapillary, OpenStreetCam and Wikimedia Commons. You can create thematic missions to work on a specific subject. The features are loaded in the tool, which automatically find available pictures around it, and offers a simple interface to answer questions and editing the features.

At start, it was helping contributors adding details on existing objects, like accessibility of crossings, name of shops, levels of buildings... This offers a wide range of possibilities, and was already used by hundreds of contributors to edit around 100000 features worldwide. Now, it also offers to integrate open datasets into OpenStreetMap, the proper way. The complexity of integrating open data in OSM lies in the accuracy of these datasets : we should check if features are correctly located, and properly described. This can be done by surveying, or using freely available pictures of our streets. This is what Pic4Review offers to simplify : import your dataset, create a mission, and work in team to integrate the data which can be verified.

This talk will present the problem of open data integration, the Pic4Review tool, and the process of using it for integrating open data.

	00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,520
welcome everybody here at the third day

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:18,420
at swattin 2019 I'm pleased to introduce

00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:21,630
utterly impervious avi avi sari which

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,020
means that from France and he will talk

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,720
about integrating and validating open

00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,330
data and also SME using street pictures

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,730
so let's see what he will tell us thank

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,890
you and hi everyone can you hear me

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:41,430
correctly yeah so easy yeah aware of

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,280
what is open data is it clear for you

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,840
what is open data or not what do you

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,460
know you will knows about open data

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,149
okay so mostly everyone so I will be

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,730
brief on that open data is a data which

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,010
is a geographical or no geographical

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,870
which can be opened by city councils

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:06,180
by governments by some societies and the

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,420
idea is that you can use it for ANOVA

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:14,580
use the purpose is to make to make this

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:18,000
data be reusable by over-over people in

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,760
open data you have some sometimes very

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,610
qualitative data like a good quality

00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,250
very exhaustive very detail and

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,920
sometimes you have more or less trash

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:33,689
you have things missing you have no

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,439
information in the intimated metadata so

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,229
it's quite true and we have to do some

00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:43,619
some sort of what is good and what is

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:47,189
not good so it's quite complicated to

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,020
use sometimes as we confirm in

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,420
OpenStreetMap we have a very rich

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,670
attribute model and most of the time the

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,579
point of interest we aiways

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,220
are very detailed so we go very deep in

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,040
the detail but there is no ground he on

00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:05,280
exhaust ability even if most of the time

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,829
the mapping is quite exhaustive nobody's

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,810
is you have to say ok we'll map is

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:13,049
complete it's not something we do

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,790
because it's a open source project and

00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:16,909
it's

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:21,140
by people contributing on their freetime

00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:22,879
must be so we have no grounds the data

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,810
is where but we are not sure it's

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,030
complete and last thing we have straight

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,459
pictures so you might be aware of what

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,920
straight pictures are these are pictures

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:37,189
which are taken by people in the streets

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,889
which channels are located and hosted on

00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:43,099
project like open sweet cam like map in

00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:45,200
re or Wikimedia Commons and the idea is

00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:48,079
that on the picture you can see many

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,450
details you can see as good as if you

00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:52,879
were there so it's very interesting as

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:57,079
as a data source to use this kind of

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,629
pictures so we have on some part open

00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:02,599
data which can be rich which can be pro

00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:05,090
depending of the source of the data we

00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,579
have Open Street Map which is very rich

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,220
in information but we are not sure it

00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:12,260
can be complete and we have a straight

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,319
picture which here which are having many

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:18,819
details and can be a source to confirm

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:22,639
if something is there and to describe it

00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:25,790
moreover so how can we combine all these

00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:30,500
data to make the best data source

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:33,379
possible in OpenStreetMap well we would

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,530
like to do something like that maybe say

00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:39,319
ok well community is working on its city

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,739
and wants to improve for example the

00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:45,079
tagging of a bus stop so we would like

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,329
to review each boost up having the

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:49,459
strictness sweet pictures around and

00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:52,669
having a simple tool to show it on the

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:56,780
web on a website so people can say ok

00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:59,540
this moustakas name that data and it is

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,000
accessible in will share and so on so

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,729
the idea was to was to make this simple

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,180
in order to improve upon sweet map and

00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:10,609
so it's mostly what dig for of you do so

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,340
you can access it on the on the web it's

00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:17,989
online and you can have access also to a

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:21,680
source code it's open source and so and

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:23,900
so it works that way it's a mostly a

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,030
website when you have mission so

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,699
you can start a mission in your city and

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,040
say okay I want to improve will share

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:33,949
description on crossing I want to add

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,380
the kind of bicycle parking you can do

00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:38,030
pretty any kind of mission as long as

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,810
you have a bit of information in

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,590
OpenStreetMap

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,389
on an open data source and then some

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:49,400
street pictures in your city otherwise

00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:51,889
it won't work out so if I select one

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,050
mission for example with crossings using

00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:58,250
wheelchair I have this kind of user

00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:01,039
interface where I can see on the left we

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,740
have a feature I'm reviewing is located

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,780
by example if this is a crossing and on

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,780
the right I have all the street pictures

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,750
available around so it's only the

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,820
pictures which are looking directly at

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,370
the feature so that way you only have

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:19,370
interesting pictures and then you can

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:22,580
review and on this kind of on this

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,550
crossing for example we see just where

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,470
that there is a possibility to pass by

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,470
wheelchair but maybe not on the other

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:33,289
side so in that case I will say ok it's

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:36,729
only one side which is accessible and

00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:39,110
when I click on this answer this

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,180
information is directly sent to the

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,880
OpenStreetMap data base and you have

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,330
contributed without even knowing what is

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,610
a tag what is a feature with what is

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,880
node and so on it's very simple you can

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,099
put you can make beginners using this

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,659
and they will do the job

00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:02,419
so it's also working on mobile phone so

00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:04,550
if you want so if you want to contribute

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:09,590
on your mobile phone is it also possible

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:11,750
so it's very responsive so you have

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,460
existing mission but you can create your

00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,530
own mission if you want to start

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,190
something on your city so where is this

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:21,800
template system which was to create some

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:26,000
mission based on existing models so you

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:29,240
have like 20 models which are available

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,060
I can make more if necessary and you

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,950
will then just choose area you want to

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,430
create the mission on and you're ready

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,430
to go

00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,030
tool will process with data and make it

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:45,170
available as a mission so you can start

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:47,390
reviewing you can also create own nation

00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,120
from scratch if you want to make

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,980
something highly configure so where you

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,740
can choose one of the data source you

00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,220
want to use it if you want to use for

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,100
example

00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:01,430
Osmos detection so we quality insurance

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:04,580
tour so if you want to use overpass for

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:07,550
example now if you want to use mapillary

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,710
detection so you might be aware that an

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,560
applet every can detect on its picture

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:16,250
if there is for example a fire you want

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,470
and say ok probably is a fire I don't on

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,510
this place but we want to be sure but it

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,880
is there before importing in

00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:26,090
OpenStreetMap so when you can add some

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,900
details on the mission and configure our

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:32,780
people should answer the simple question

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,880
so it's quite a bit more complicated but

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,540
it shows advanced user to create their

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,270
own mission varies Mamie to contributing

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,670
model on this tour so complete existing

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,130
OpenStreetMap data so we take data from

00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,810
overpass and we say ok I want to add

00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:51,560
this kind of information which

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:54,970
accessibility issue whatever or we can

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,650
import open data so we make we take

00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:00,440
information from a city council or

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,050
government I want to import into Open

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,210
Street Map but not in bulk we want to

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,100
import feature by feature to be sure

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:12,470
that we are not importing something

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:15,320
which doesn't exist in reality so the

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:18,260
data sources from this now are mainly

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,600
the open data which is available from

00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,790
the Osmo store so we are was another

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:27,230
presentation of Osmos during the event

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:29,750
so we can have a look at it many what it

00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,880
does is that it takes the open data it

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,490
looks at the OpenStreetMap data and say

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,530
ok this one is missing this one is

00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,830
already on the database and can be

00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:42,920
completed and it's making you know

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,509
compression and we can use mapillary

00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:48,180
feature detection so like

00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:53,250
detection of streetlights detection of

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:56,519
benches and so on so many example of

00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:00,029
what can be added for this tool so

00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,790
street light traffic signs power station

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:05,310
those bugs mostly every kind of point of

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:10,170
in the interest can be added this way so

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:12,240
it's made to be very easy and I will

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:16,410
present you or live demonstration of

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,480
this so we are using some open data set

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,939
in France which is a describing the

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,509
power substation so it's a technical

00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:28,470
team in the power power grid and where

00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:31,290
we have probably a power substation yeah

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,389
and in the picture I can see there this

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,819
little white building it's a very

00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:38,459
characteristic in France so I know there

00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:41,100
is a power substation at this place and

00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:43,649
if I want to correct a bit the position

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,470
you know it looks quite exact for

00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:50,040
example I can move it a bit like that

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,500
and directly import the data and say ok

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,350
the future is there I have adjusted its

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,899
position and now it's in OpenStreetMap

00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:01,379
so it's very simple you can do it in

00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:04,800
like thousand of this during our so it's

00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:08,610
very simple you know for example I can't

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,980
see one so I will say ok I can't see it

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:14,250
so I'm not sure I will not import I just

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,569
keep and then you do it for every every

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:24,329
object and you can add thousand of them

00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:27,000
quite easily so if you if we look back a

00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:31,139
state at a statistics we project was

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,040
around for more than one year no and we

00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:38,540
are like 600 different user which have

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,550
already used it and they are added like

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:47,100
hundred of thousand object and for

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:49,410
example we have 2800 fire hydrants which

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,399
have been added in the world we have

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,949
more than eleven thousand of pedestrian

00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,480
crossings which have been improving the

00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:59,250
description so mostly

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,779
saying if they are accessible in

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:08,480
wheelchair and we have like 7000 power

00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:08,480
substation in front so it's not bad bad

00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:13,380
so the tool is already doing a lot of

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,800
things but we want to go further because

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:19,589
as you see we have only two named data

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,899
sources for now we have to add the open

00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:25,589
data in Ausmus first if we want to use

00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:28,199
it in the picture review tool so maybe

00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:30,660
when one idea of a future will be to

00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:33,600
extend it to all open that asset like

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,120
you can import your work your CSV file

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,300
or George is on file and then generally

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,190
create a mission and but there will be

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,829
some difficulties if we do that because

00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,769
every data source has different

00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:49,980
attributes if out naming and we have to

00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:52,800
make it understandable by the OSM

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:56,399
tagging system so how do we do how do we

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,070
combat this data set into something less

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,750
incompatible so maybe we can use the

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,370
Semantic Web which is something doing

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,980
which has been around for a long time

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,709
but not used yet for this kind of

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,589
application or maybe you can also think

00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:17,010
of exporting directly from open data

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:19,949
portals into XML or SM format so that

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:25,139
would be easier to use so very thing to

00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:27,569
do around this subject we can also try

00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:30,269
to make the data even before it is

00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:32,310
published so we can ALPA maybe city

00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:35,459
councils or governments to make their

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,740
data cleaner as before we publish it so

00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:40,010
maybe they could use it for review

00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,800
internally to make the data more

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:46,290
described and more qualitative and maybe

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,060
we can also stop result of the

00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:50,579
contribution in people for review in

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,949
some cross databases so we can use it

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:57,380
internally try to do the world process

00:12:52,949 --> 00:13:01,110
by themself and then later publish it

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:03,870
and so big file view is a open source

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,750
project so you can still help us to make

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:09,150
it even better the main things we are

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,610
looking for translation

00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,720
we have like eight from wages for now I

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:20,040
think there is a French English Japanese

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:24,120
maybe Chinese also a countryman eight of

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,680
them and so if you have if you want to

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,890
make it available in your own language

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,200
you can start translating I'm also

00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,540
pleased to have always a the user

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,330
feedback to make it better so if you use

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,700
it and find something like he or some

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,760
bug don't hesitate to contact me and

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,740
then I also do some development work to

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,560
make the new features available and the

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:51,779
bug fixing so yeah you can participate

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,160
and it will help make the tool better so

00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:56,990
as a conclusion

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:59,880
this tool is quite simple but makes as

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,339
possible to take the best of the open

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,770
data and open sweet map so we have

00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:08,310
quality of OpenStreetMap and exhaust

00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:12,360
ility of open data set pictures make the

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:15,330
data there is a variable because we are

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,959
sure that the information is there we

00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:21,390
have a date survey date so things are

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,450
quite clear of where the information is

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:29,190
coming from and I hope this is the start

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:32,250
of amazing that I Johnny so just a

00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,709
little confusion before before yen

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,930
quality is never an accident it is

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:39,630
always the result of intelligent effort

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:43,700
it's a quotation from John Ruskin which

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:46,789
is a writer and beta thank you

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,789
[Applause]

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,600
[Applause]

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,880
for your great talk and the introduction

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:03,880
are there any questions in the audience

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:06,580
I really liked the idea of having a

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,200
mission in order to improve data and do

00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,930
you think it would be possible to do the

00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,120
same without a picture but live to go to

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,340
check if somebody was wrong to make like

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,440
a lab it because it looks like a game

00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:21,210
and do you think we could extend it in

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,210
other ways to improve the awesome data

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,890
yeah I think it's possible but maybe

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,330
it's not big for view which will be the

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:32,020
best tool for this because we are

00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:35,200
already application doing run survey x2

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,120
it completely like osm own in some in

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,880
some way so we are already existing

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,070
application doing this as it is a

00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,020
website and it's done loading a lot of

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:48,550
data because you are getting the

00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:51,460
pictures which are quite ideal you know

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,680
adding a resolution so it's not meant

00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:57,400
for mobile in the fact that it's quite

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,620
using a lot of data but it would be

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,990
interesting to maybe push forward over

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:05,200
application to make them muffin and

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:07,870
maybe more easy to use so that while

00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,540
people going live on the ground and

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,400
doing survey will be it will be easier

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,470
for them to contribute but maybe not

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,590
really with each review it's not meant

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,830
for but we maybe push forward the

00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:23,160
community to make tours of beta

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,160
foreground sorry

00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:34,180
hi I'm Jonathan Brown from Canada and

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,519
one of the things I see a lack in

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:40,089
building a bridge between open data and

00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,620
the OSM there was a great presence at

00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:45,700
the Madrid international open data

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:48,430
conference of OSM but not in Buenos

00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,410
Aires last one the next one is in

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,170
Nairobi Kenya is wondering if it would

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,839
be useful to think about combining what

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:59,260
you've done with teach osm and then do

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,579
something as a session in Nairobi as

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,900
part of the international open data

00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:07,589
conference yeah for sure we can we can

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:11,199
think of ways to make it more known and

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:14,020
available for more people but yeah it's

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,240
still something taking some time so yeah

00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,929
definitely local communities can use it

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:27,250
and maybe improve it so a lot right if

00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:29,740
it answers the question looks like with

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,890
the open data community in the OSM

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,660
community okay getting a more

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,740
sustainable connection between those

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,169
communities

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,650
yeah and that's it's interesting to use

00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:42,550
the Osmos tool because it makes

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,890
synchronization between the open data

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,290
set and what's in OpenStreetMap but

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:50,320
still it's something technical we should

00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:53,169
definitely go for own cooperation we've

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,030
opened that manager it's something we do

00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:57,520
for example in France we are trying to

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:00,220
push for about this visiting episode

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,040
subject but I know it might not be the

00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,590
case in all countries so yeah definitely

00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,590
it's something a local community should

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:12,130
be aware and maybe push forward the

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:14,110
authorities to publish more data and see

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:20,500
how we can work with OpenStreetMap in

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:22,929
some cases I was wondering do you often

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,000
find that there are points that are

00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:26,110
nowhere near any kind of imagery at the

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,880
points that are difficult to validate

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:31,590
because because nobody is driven

00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:35,490
mapillary or op3 Karen either

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:39,330
where it can happen sometimes but most

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:42,860
of the time we we still find we we still

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:46,440
find refuge shows on the picture because

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:49,890
mostly data is not bad bad open data is

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,350
not bad that but it's a most of the time

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,800
a lack of precision like the feature is

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:59,250
there but it's like maybe 50 meters away

00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,260
so it could lead to some problems

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,120
finding them because we are looking at

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,400
exact position with a picture

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,240
so yeah in some time we can't find it

00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,400
because it's like 50 meters away so the

00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:16,050
ideas may need to integrate was easy

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:19,020
what is easy to do and for complex cases

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,000
with 10 last percent of the data we have

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,400
to look for well and maybe find it or

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,800
somewhere so yeah it's making the

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:30,200
working more easier but we still have

00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,200
some cases to do manually I would say

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,970
for questions if there are more

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,840
questions in the audience

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,840
there's one

00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:57,999
hi

00:19:53,499 --> 00:20:00,759
great great - great - one question in

00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:04,509
your example with the power stations if

00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:07,990
there's actually not a power station you

00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:09,669
pressed on skip does it mean that the

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,580
other people who will do this mission

00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:16,629
will have this question again and again

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:19,539
or is there some way to say okay it

00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:22,419
definitely doesn't exist here in fact

00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:25,570
very simple system to handle that if

00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:29,259
three different peoples keep one feature

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:33,039
it is been injured it is not shown to

00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:36,850
any other user so as long as VI is no

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:39,279
new picture of this area any change in

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:41,590
the input data we don't show it anymore

00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,360
- of a user so you have to have three

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:46,480
different people skipping this feature

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,720
if it is Eden so that way if you just

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,570
click miss click on this thing it is not

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,659
Eden for every one four five I would say

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,149
so yeah three skips and then it is in

00:20:55,659 --> 00:21:00,909
your but still it's a way to make this

00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:04,799
more secure to not lost feature which

00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:04,799
could be integrated but yeah

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,200
it looks like your great tool and so

00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,490
it's a good job when you showed us the

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,250
demo the first thing that came to mind

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:27,400
is I mean that's clearly machine

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:29,080
learning that we could you could

00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,390
possibly add on the side is that

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,700
something that you've thought about or

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:36,700
something that could help in the future

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,740
yeah and in fact we are already

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,690
indirectly using machine learning

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,430
because we integrate the map reader with

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:46,720
detection which are done by a machine

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:49,110
learning the idea is what we using human

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,790
verification to make the data

00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:54,430
qualitative to make sure very something

00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:58,780
because my machine learning is improving

00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:01,690
everyday but it's not 100% quality it

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,210
may be more than 19 percent but in

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:07,060
OpenStreetMap we are doing very creative

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:10,690
things very making sure things are well

00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,790
so that's why it must be doing human job

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:16,570
and the idea of using machine learning

00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:20,050
will be to automate things but before

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:22,960
you know actually trying to detect new

00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,240
features and so on and then we can make

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,730
people validate okay this one is very

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,950
well detected and it is well so I can

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,320
put it on OpenStreetMap otherwise we

00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:36,730
will have a lot of false positive in the

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:39,210
database it will be not useful so but

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,210
the idea

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,700
so looks like there are no more

00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:48,000
questions so we think a turian again for

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,000
the great

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,519
you

00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,519
