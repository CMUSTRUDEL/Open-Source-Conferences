Hey

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,900

[Applause]

00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:29,630
so welcome to OpenStreetMap to state of

00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:33,650
the map and social the delay normally I

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:37,340
stop more dramatic than that and so if I

00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:40,040
hit my slides and here we are at state

00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,600
to the map I'm Gregory do you come and

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,780
say hi to me during the breaks

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,269
I'm nicely wearing one of the green

00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,040
Spidey's that you can get from the desk

00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:51,320
I also want to say hello to the people

00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,140

now hear me if not you'll be tweeting

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,780
and we'll get onto that but before we

00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:03,229
get onto this some of you may recognize

00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:06,200

00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:09,710
welcome professor zit he's going to

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:15,130

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:24,540
hi everybody it's my big pleasure as a

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,009
host to welcome all of you here to the

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:32,100
State of the map Freud Heidelberg it's

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,500
of course not me who is doing all that

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,600
work but the local team wonderful team

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:43,259
and thanks to them first of all but then

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,770
you made us why Heidelberg and I might

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,970
point out to our more than 10 years of

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,619
activities with awesome data and

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,259
developing awesome services

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,649
but because I'm an old and white-haired

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:59,069
professor I have to tell you a really

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:04,049
old story about historic things starting

00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:06,569
in 1386 so with more than 600 years ago

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,330
that's when Heidelberg University was

00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:13,110
actually founded making it the oldest

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,299
university in Germany and what's the

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,569
story about that the story is that it

00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:22,709
has a motto since then which is in Latin

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:24,950
and it says semper paratus does anybody

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:28,799
know what this means

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:31,260
always open that's it so always hope

00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:33,120
when I sit since 600 years the matter of

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,640
Heidelberg University which makes it the

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,410
perfect place to welcome you for open

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,350
date and open access and open source

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,660
conference but 600 years ago it was not

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,320
about that sense it was about being

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:50,519
open-minded and open-mindedness means

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,970
yeah letting new ideas from all parts of

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:57,180
the community from different regions of

00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,090
the world cultures nature's subgroups

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,359
and specific thematic areas and so on

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,819
come and let inspire you and discuss it

00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:08,519
in an open manner and I think this is

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:12,000
very important for a community of that

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:15,930
big and diverse at the OSM community is

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,079
right now and that's why I really asked

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:23,100
you to be open and that comes to our

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:25,230
motto of the conference which is

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,989
bridging the map which is again an

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,260
adaptation of one of the themes at

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,750
Heidelberg unique

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,230
which is actually crossing bridges

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,970
because we have this diversion of the

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,099
Natural Sciences campus where we are

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,260
here at the moment and the humanities

00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,420
and social science campus at the old

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,349
university which is divided by the neck

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,730
River and reaching the map is something

00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:50,769
heidelberg university really strives to

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,280
do for a long time taking active

00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:56,110
measures and because this does not come

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,690
naturally you have to do something for

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,370
that to integrate the different

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,459
disciplines the different thinking so

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,910
different languages people talk and I

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,650
hope that this motto can be a part of

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,629
this conference where we all come

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:14,049
together now face to face be able to

00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:20,470
talk to each other in person and yeah

00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:21,970
bridging the map so for hydric

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,210
university that worked out quite well

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:28,389
actually so we are very good in the

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,710
recent rankings and maybe one other sign

00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:34,210
is you can see an other I went taking

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,120
place next week which is the

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,680
hydrochloric forum that's an event we

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,660
are not the price we're now securing

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,910
Award winners and field metal winners

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,900
gather together in a yearly meeting and

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:49,570
if you are on your crawl this evening or

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,430
over the weekend it's quite possible

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:55,830
that you bump into another Prize winner

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:59,349
and so we are in very good company and

00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,889
that shows that together we are stronger

00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:06,550
that when we really try to bridge the

00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:11,590
map and in open that this is a possible

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:16,210
to successful future yeah future that's

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:18,340
a lot and last theme park has in its

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,260
local words written to confess I try to

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,740
know that section off six of future sins

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:26,199
that in 86 looking towards the future of

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,810
being progressive shaping the future but

00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,360
with a knowledge in background whatever

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,520
where you come from and future is of

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,500
course also the theme of the day with

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,099
Fridays for future scientists for future

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,350
being active or climate strike and of

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:45,340
course GIS map

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:47,560
skewed data Geoscience methods and for

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,480
that reason or open street that has some

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:55,150
role in birds here we know that it's

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:58,330
important that we can measure and a

00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,250
model the environmental issues with maps

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,800
with geographic information with

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,940
Geographic techniques so we don't want

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,950
to always stretch the goal of

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,160
OpenStreetMap but it has a little roll

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,740
in it some examples from our site at

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,810
Harvard University include for example

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,960
the climate protection lepto Lima should

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,460
scatter order or open fuel service which

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,310
is a service that calculates fuel

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,560
consumption and also emissions causing

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:27,220
air pollutions from cars along the

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,750
routes in integrator than the be our

00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,690
first osm route planner open route

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,180
service or generate land use maps from

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,760
OS m and remote sensing data combining

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:43,720
that with machine learning and so on so

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:46,840
we think that OS m can be to some degree

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,760
part part to provide better data to make

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,120
more informed decisions also about our

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,970
future and this was also a big topic and

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,640
heavily discussed in the hot summit over

00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,620
the last few days already but now I

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,530
think it's actually time to get the

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,740
study part a party started go P open

00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:08,920
sample purchase and bridge the maps for

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,900
a more climate-friendly future maybe but

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,370
first of all enjoy heidelberg have a

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,370
good conference and all the best

00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:25,220
like Thank You professor so wonderful

welcome there from the history of being

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,610
opened open straight up and open data

00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,140
what I'm saying now there's a lot of

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,390
information I'm probably going to give

00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,480
you there's probably some notices I

00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,550
forget but if you need some help

00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,310
first of all you'll see people in these

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,160
beautiful blue t-shirts they're here to

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,440
help you so you can ask them a question

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,290
they don't know everything but now have

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,260
a smiley face and now help you find

00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:56,030
someone who can answer your question so

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,370
if you're unsure if I've told you too

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,530
much and you've forgotten it go if I'm

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:04,310
one of them that includes me and and

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:07,190
they can help you you can also look at

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:10,790
your booklet I've scribbled over mine to

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,130
say which talks so what to go to and and

00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,290
where I need to be so look at your

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,630
booklet it's got helpful information

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:20,960
it's got maps it's got other things in

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:24,020
there you can check the website as well

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:28,870
which has up-to-date information and

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:31,970
there's some boards outside in the foyer

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,760
the orange boxes on there are changes

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,770
from the booklet so maybe you just want

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,560
to scribble on and update your booklet

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:42,370
to be the most up-to-date things

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,050
happening and we have to change things

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,080
there's also the giggety up has the

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,960
schedule in there as well so lots of

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,300
ways to find information and hopefully

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,100
we can help you and if you really

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,830
struggling to find someone in a blue

00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,330
t-shirt you will come past the Welcome

00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:05,590
Desk where you registered and they'll

00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:08,780
always be people where say we're here

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:10,790
with the theme breaking the map we want

00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,920
to make friends and support each other

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,660
you know there's lots of us here we've

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,250
all come from different places

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,860
whoever that's different countries

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,650
different backgrounds which is really

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,710
great some of us on one of the tour

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:28,610
guides went into museum and the lady

00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,420
asked where we're from and we had the UK

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,150
we had Germany we

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,700
Switzerland and this lady was good Oh

00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:38,940
and where were you from Malaysia

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,530
oh I'm where are you from Greece oh and

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,330
it was really exciting and I think she

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,340
was quite impressed and I really loved

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,280
that in our conference

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:50,100
we've got code of conduct to kind of

00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,610
show our commitment to try to provide a

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,590
safe and inclusive space and it just

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,960
kind of says we want to deal with things

00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:01,830
if she's struggling maybe if you felt

00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:03,720
uncomfortable or unwelcomed then then we

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:07,970
want to know about it so we can sort it

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,710
out or find out what the issue is and so

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,450
to avoid that there's too many people if

00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,700
there are issues we want to deal with

00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,760

to run a conference like this it takes a

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,560
long time there's things that cost money

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,940
most of all and so they helped us they

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,900

thank the sponsors for those say there's

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:04,560
a lot to expect to say this is a very

00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,360
packed booklet so there's talks

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,700
there's workshops maybe you've looked

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,210
through and you starting to see the ones

00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:15,060
you want there's an academic track the

00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:17,310
academic track has been kind of reviewed

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:21,030
and there's proceedings and it's all

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:23,880
very good if your academic it's you know

00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:26,550
professional and and great in that and

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,610
I'm not an academic really a trumpet

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:32,130
tend to be sometimes and I can still go

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,390
to those talks if you're interested so

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,370
there might be talk to you want to know

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:39,510
what research are they doing or have

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:42,210
done around open geo data you can go to

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:44,330
the academic talk and go in there

00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,480
likewise anyone who's just come from the

00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:49,670
academic come to the other talks

00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,600
and it's really great to see the

00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:56,120
bridging different communities and make

00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:01,220
sure you move around go to different

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:04,430
charts we have a few traditions so we

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,610
have some workable spaces which used to

00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,990
be called birds of a feather so there's

00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:13,070
lots of different groups within

00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:15,230
OpenStreetMap perhaps you're trying to

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,390
do some riverboat routing and you want

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,920
to find a solution and you want to see

00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,710
if there's other people working on that

00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,740
you can propose applicable you can use

00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:27,440
the bookable space to propose people get

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,240
together and discuss that maybe you

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,860
enjoy mapping parks and you want to know

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,620
if there's other people and you can

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,000
learn from them propose a session I

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:39,650
won't go through all the possible topics

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,140
it's endless and if you want to use the

00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,570
book of all space there's a flip chart

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,870
out in the foyer by the job board so

00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:52,130
it's kind of on the back of this wall

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:53,720
opposite the Welcome Desk and you can go

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,940
there and write your name up on a slot

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,250
and I think we're gonna make the sign up

00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,770
for lightning talks later lightning

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:04,400
talks at kind of five minutes very

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:07,280
snappy talks so you can come with slides

00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,620
you don't need to it might be something

00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,740
cool that you want to share or that

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:14,270
you've done that you weren't able to

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:18,320
kind of propose in time for the official

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:21,860
call for sessions so you can do that in

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,660
the lightning talks and there's some

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,300
evening activities I won't go through

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:30,170
them all because they're in the booklet

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:32,410
but tonight we're at EBU holla so we'll

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,630
have a social that we drink some food

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:38,030
and the details are in the booklet and

00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:42,730
we'll be talking about them later in the

00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:48,950
day and the week t-shirts go to that

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:51,290
there will be information yep and so I

00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,700
think amazingly I'm working quite well

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:59,720
