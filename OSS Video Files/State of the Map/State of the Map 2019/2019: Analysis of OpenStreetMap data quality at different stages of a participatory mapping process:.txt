Description: 
	This study examines OpenStreetMap data quality at different stages of a participatory mapping process developed for understanding inequalities in healthcare access of informal urban residents in Africa and Asia. Recent studies have examined quality intrinsically and extrinsically. However, in both cases, the data production processes are often not completely transparent to researchers, therefore limiting possibilities for systematic data quality analysis of the processes leading to OpenStreetMap update.

Globally, the lack of detailed quality spatial data of informal urban settings, such as slums, is increasingly becoming a concern to both researchers and development agencies (Hachmann, Jokar Arsanjani, & Vaz, 2017; Kuffer, Pfeffer, & Sliuzas, 2016). One potential for making spatial data available is through Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) which is opening up new possibilities of data production in recent years and facilitating the emergence of several initiatives aimed at “putting the most vulnerable people on the map” (MissingMaps.org, 2018; Shekhar, 2014). The increasing availability of volunteered and crowdsourced geographic information, in particular OpenStreetMap (OSM), has led to plethora of scientific studies with emphasis on evaluating the quality of the OSM data. The quality assessment results are usually presented in the form of tables, diagrams, map and statistics per given area (Barron, Neis, & Zipf, 2014; Sehra, Singh, & Rai, 2017). Some recent studies have examined OSM data quality without using any external data; the so called intrinsic approach (Barron et al., 2014). In contrast to intrinsic approach, other studies commonly used what is referred to as the extrinsic approach where the OSM data is compared with external datasets such as the UK Ordnance Survey data or National Park Service lists (Haklay, 2010; Zipf, 2017). In both approaches, the data production processes are often not completely transparent to researchers therefore limiting possibilities for systematic data quality analysis of the processes leading to OpenStreetMap update.

This presentation examines OSM data quality at different stages of a participatory mapping process developed as part of an ongoing research project focused on understanding inequalities in healthcare access of slum residents in the Global South. The following research questions are addressed: (1) What is the level of spatial data quality one can expect at different stages of the mapping process leading to final update of the OpenStreetMap database? (2) What are the factors influencing quality? Our exploratory method applies recently developed data analytics framework for spatio-temporal analysis of OpenStreetMap History Database (OSHDB) to our study areas vis-à-vis the participatory mapping process workflow. OSHDB framework will serve as a mediating framework to allow flexible analyses of OSM full history data completeness in our study areas. A multi-country case study associated with an ongoing research project of the National Institute for Health Research Global Health Unit on Improving Health in Slums at University of Warwick is used. This Unit focuses on health services in slums through the study of seven slum sites across two continents (Asia and Africa), with the ultimate aim of finding optimal ways to deliver health services to slum dwellers (Lilford, 2017). The historical data sets are derived from the following stages in the participatory mapping process: before online mapping (i.e. digitisation from satellite imagery), after online mapping and validation but before ground-truthing, and, after ground-truthing. The before-and-after estimates at each mapping stage are discussed together with lessons learnt, and feedback, from the project including comments from fieldworkers and supervisors. We thus present initial results from a spatial data quality assessment of the mapping process workflow used to map our study areas and update the OpenStreetMap database.

okay so well

00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:17,880
or leaving I I want to welcome

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,369
Godwin gardenia bar which is a research

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,260
fellow at the global sustainable

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,900
development Research Institute at

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,930
Warwick University and we're going to

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,880
stay on the topic of informal

00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:33,059
settlements if I correct but look at

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:40,230
data quality at different stages so the

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:42,180
floor is yours okay so my presentation

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,520
is about analysis of awesome data

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,590
quality our different stages of a party

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,620
remarkable process evidence from

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,219
informal insurgents and this preliminary

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:57,359
study is being courted by myself

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,129
Rafael Troilo from hagit Vangelis and

00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,699
Joe also from the same Institute as

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:06,479
myself and okay so the logos below are

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,070
the logos of our partners and other

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,180
collaborators and the one at the top

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:15,000
right is for our main funder so as an

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,290
overview I'm going to highlight the

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,799
research questions guiding this

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,570
preliminary study and then I'll talk

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,969
about the ongoing project and then

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,670
highlight the I'll talk about the

00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:28,829
participatory mapping process and then

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,100
how we define the mapping stages from

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:34,979
this process and so the nurse will be

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,780
the resource from these define mapping

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,530
stages and then give some concluding

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,539
remarks so one of the question is what

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,119
is the level of special data quality one

00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:46,469
can expect a different stages of the

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,350
mapping process leading to the final

00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:51,390
update of the øresund database and also

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,939
what are the factors likely to influence

00:01:51,390 --> 00:02:00,560
quality so these two research questions

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:03,149
are explored using an ongoing project so

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,070
respect to their own ongoing project its

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,190
relevance to an issue relevance to

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,990
awesome well I would say one thing that

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,720
we are doing differently is that we are

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,210
systematically adapting awesome to

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,070
develop a specially regulated sampling

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,160
method in health research in a

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,350
multi-country informal urban settings

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,909
this specially regulated sampling method

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,190
is not actually presented in this

00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:30,200
presentation but

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,550
just put a citation there if you're

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,970
interested you can look at it later

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:39,160
so this ongoing project is entitled

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,300
National Institute for Health Research

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,010
Global Health researching it on

00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,710
improving health in slums at University

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,470
of Warwick and the goals are to map

00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:51,650
health services and facilities and

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:55,220
understand their usage across several

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:58,250
slums in Asia and Africa and to build on

00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,890
these maps 200 identified cost

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,050
associated with seeking health care and

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,960
also to build economic models of health

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,550
services so across these goals we are

00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,720
involving people who can change things

00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:14,240
like politicians slum residents and also

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,370
the OSM community and also we are

00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,770
collating assistant evidence to inform

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,590
this the projects a four year project

00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:27,470
and costing around and sis million

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:29,900
pounds and it has five main web packages

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,670
and the results in this presentation are

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,470
drawn from the web packet one which

00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,890
mainly about the geospatial mapping of

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,890
the slums

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,350
so in what package one we are framing a

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:45,200
research challenge as at the

00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,239
intersection of special data quality on

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,160
one hand and community engagement on the

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,930
other so really try to combine both so

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,750
the trade-off is the challenge and we

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,760
try to use a combination of methods from

00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:00,650
geospatial data science social research

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,660
to tackle this challenge and the project

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,360
partners University of Warwick is the

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,070
leading institution lead institution in

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,280
Africa we're working with an investor

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,840
fee burden in Nigeria in Kenya we

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,989
working with African population and

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,239
Health Research Center in Asia we

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,489
working with Agra Connie worst in

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:22,010
Pakistan and in Bangladesh we working

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:24,169
with independent resti Bangladesh

00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:26,210
I've highlighted there are about seven

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,919
slums we were studying but for this for

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,630
this presentation I've highlighted those

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,970
that I'm going to show the results so

00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,150
Sasha and in Nigeria

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,870
Korogocho in Kenya and as ambassador in

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,870
Pakistan

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,670
just to give you a bit of idea about how

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,430
they these three slumps look like so

00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:50,450
this as a massive long the builders are

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,820
very tall durable and the structures are

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,340
the roof of rooftop architecture of the

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,730
structures are of concrete type and also

00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,170
there seem to be building structures in

00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,670
a vertical fashion on top of these

00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:06,650
structures and this we realize also has

00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,660
implications on selected the image

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,430
interpretation during the mapping so

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,890
this is the satellite imagery but then

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,560
we found it very difficult to interpret

00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:18,020
the building footprint and this our show

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,020
animation showing this geometric change

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:25,100
and also some graphs in the case of

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:28,520
Russia in Nigeria is slightly different

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:32,450
so it's not it's not that durable the

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,730
structures the rooftops are like of the

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:40,960
roof tiles are like roofing sheets is

00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:43,880
less dense and also not that tall yeah

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,690
in in case of in the case of Korogocho

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:50,000
is the densest of the three and also has

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,970
some similar characteristics in terms of

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,669
the rooftop architecture like Russia but

00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:59,540
slightly different from as ambassador in

00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:01,550
that sense so the part spirit marketing

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,050
process this starts with the preparation

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,169
steps

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:10,910
preparation steps where we we negotiate

00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:14,270
Islam asses with local partners and also

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:17,780
we prepare the mapping platform using

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,430
hot task in manager also we procure

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,120
satellite imagery 50 centimeters under

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,980
imagery we procure and also with other

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,750
state we do also the training the

00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,570
trainers and things like that and also

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,520
we define responsibilities amongst

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,080
ourselves ourselves at university of

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,260
warwick and that of the local partners

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,850
across asia and africa the next step is

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,730
online mapping where we use the tasking

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,100
manager to do the mapping and in online

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,270
validation will use a awesome to do the

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:51,080
validation with the help of other

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:54,050
experience mappers and so after that we

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,260
go to the field we do GPS field mapping

00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:01,160
we track the roads and footpaths in

00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:04,250
particular and conflict the awesome

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,990
database at the GPS deviation level and

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,630
then after that we print the field

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,500
papers go to the field we do what we

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,970
call a structure geometric verification

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,890
we do this in Montana Slee where the

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:20,660
other step structure coordinate in Feud

00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:23,900
notes we realized that the funeral's has

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:27,560
to be a collector in a structured manner

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:30,490
so we combine that with the field papers

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,900
and using open data Cade and open market

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:37,060
afterwards the data collected is

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:42,670
conflating into the OpenStreetMap and

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:45,890
then beyond that we do - we do - key

00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,980
surveys so household survey just to

00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,360
identify the structures that are

00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,910
inhabited and those that are not and

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,280
also the hakka foresee survey and after

00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,380
that we construct the sampling frame for

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,200
the other web packet that is the

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,500
household survey so this sampling frame

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,760
once it's constructed we use the

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,150
spiritual regulated sampling method I

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:12,530
mentioned earlier to draw about thousand

00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:15,500
households for this survey these are

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:18,140
some statistics for the map of the

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,800
participant what is interesting here is

00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:24,710
the case of Bangladesh the third from

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,840
from left where we had the presence of

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:30,380
awesome community and that helped also

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,090
in the first four station of the of the

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:37,280
of the training and then also of the

00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:40,520
fuel work itself these are some examples

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,430
of the online mapping events involving

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,150
the community in Bangladesh and then

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:49,040
Nigeria and these are some of the

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:52,340
examples of the photographs of the

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:57,150
fieldwork itself in Bangladesh and also

00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:59,730
in Kenya so

00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,320
this map is stages are drawn from the

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,240
mapping process the pathways mapping

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:08,670
process and we are defining the stages

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,020
first stage one being the before online

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,570
mapping the period before online mapping

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,580
and stage ubi in the online mapping and

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,620
validation so at this point we've not

00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,090
yet gone to the field so state 3 is the

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,100
actual field where the period for the

00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,280
field work and up to the point where the

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,260
sampling frame or the data is sort of

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:29,450
extracted for constructing the sampling

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,800
frame and we look at the complete nurse

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,630
and also the modification so

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,870
modification within this period and then

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,070
completeness I'm also at the what we've

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,830
referred to as the completeness

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:44,130
milestones so we have this red lines

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:48,120
there as completeness milestones and

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:51,540
others at those points we computed as we

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:55,500
estimate the in this case in complainers

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,690
the assistance of features and we found

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,200
it interesting also to compute the ratio

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:04,490
of the computers estimate my stone

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,890
estimate at stage 3 over that of the

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:11,130
complex my stone estimate of stage stage

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,960
2 so stage 2 we have the just digitize

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,430
the online digitized is satellite

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,590
imagery desired from the satellite

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,660
imagery and then state III we've done

00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,610
the fieldwork and what I do compared it

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,850
to and we are framing this as complete

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,760
as differential so just to compare and

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,970
know the differences so from this I'm

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:33,860
going to show you complete graphs for

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:36,660
these three satellite slum areas and

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:40,760
also the modification for this slum

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:43,380
areas so in the case of as ambassador

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,050
this is a complete graph did complete

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,350
differential the ratio or in terms of in

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,180
percentage terms is about 82 percent

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:55,770
suggesting that actually the estimate at

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,180
stage 3 that is of the gut or you can

00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:01,590
refer to as the grant you can estimate

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:05,370
is or the gap between the state 3 and

00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:07,530
the state 2 is about 18 percent and you

00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,379
see that in state 3 also a lot of work

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,449
being done in the

00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:13,369
so I wanted to show you actually what

00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:14,899
actually happened because we had a

00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:17,869
problem with the interpretation of the

00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:20,660
start light imagery the the geometry or

00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:23,119
should I say the map is three slightly

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:27,829
different from the map in state two and

00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:29,509
this how it works so here it's a stage

00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:32,149
one and state two goes on by from the

00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:32,600
from left to right you see a complete

00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,699
change

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,249
you know if you notice that but you see

00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:38,569
a complete change so that's the the

00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:40,549
program with the interpretation of the

00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:44,449
satellite imagery causing this change

00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:46,189
because almost all the things digitized

00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:52,129
features digitized the buildings

00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:54,799
digitized changed in chakra the the gap

00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:56,329
is very small this or the complete

00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:00,679
differential in percentage percentage

00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:04,189
terms is very wide go very high so in a

00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:10,279
way it could suggest that if you if you

00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:12,860
complete stage two then it's almost okay

00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,079
to sort of use it for Stage three work

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:19,100
without necessarily going to the to the

00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:21,799
field in the case of culture which is

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,759
the dances of the three there's a wide

00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:28,249
gap which is about 37 percent between

00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,449
stage three and then stage two we are

00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:33,799
still talking about completeness of

00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:36,949
buildings here so but then in all of

00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:39,259
these three you notice that the the

00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:42,459
pattern the withers one part one common

00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:45,769
pattern across which is the estimate

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:49,910
Stage three is always less than that of

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:55,369
stage two so in a way I'll talk about

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:57,410
that later in the case of the road the

00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:59,449
part is slightly different so the

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,929
estimates are still three is always

00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:08,480
higher not less higher than our stage

00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:10,639
two and is the same for Russia even

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,069
though is higher but then the difference

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,749
is very small but and it's still higher

00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:19,939
and the same applies to Korogocho now

00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:23,480
let's look at the modifications within

00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:25,339
the stages so we have

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,640
a lot of work being done in stage three

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:32,450
you see the red bars there and the case

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,670
of C just sort of confirming what

00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:37,940
happened in the animation or what I've

00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:40,850
talked about so far because of the

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,620
difficulty in stage two and they had to

00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:46,070
do a lot of work in stage three the

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:49,100
field in the case of sha sha is slightly

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:55,000
different because no not a lot of work

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:58,100
in stage three in the case of gorgeo

00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:05,810
appears to be a lot of work in tagging

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:10,490
and also deleting so in terms of factors

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:12,200
influencing quality the preliminary

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,120
analysis so far suggests that density is

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,520
key to that

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,529
- t or density of buildings or in that

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,870
case I've not shown that of routier but

00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:26,350
density of buildings or roads seem to

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:30,140
have influence on quality so the the the

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:32,150
denser the the the features the wider

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:35,589
the gap or the lower the completed

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:39,620
differential in percentage terms and

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:41,570
also the rooftop architecture appears to

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,410
have influence on quality because of

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,410
what I've just talked about

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,700
well it's linked to difficulty

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,160
interpretation which in turns actually

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,790
have influence on quality that's

00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:00,320
basically what we want to say here and

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:02,300
also the the the results offer suggests

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,850
that mapping skills computer skills

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,390
knowledge of the tools are all factors

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,920
influencing quality so capacity building

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,740
is essential for slum community

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,720
engagement in mapping activities

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,209
especially in this context when we want

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,900
to involve a slum residents which we

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:26,810
consider to be a local airspace

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:29,720
so in summary grant routine is essential

00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:34,280
for areas with higher density of

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,770
buildings and also of roads and we found

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,230
out that

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,790
truth estimates about eighteen to thirty

00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,770
seven percent less than that of the

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,570
online map industry so I'm basically

00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:46,300
saying that the untruth estimates that

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:49,660
is the stage three is always less than

00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:54,640
that of the online not necessarily stage

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:56,260
two and also the results of our points

00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,900
to the fact that less dense areas can

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,030
reasonably rush adapted course they're

00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,860
reasonably be used as a sampling frame

00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:07,270
without necessarily going to the ground

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,790
and roads are easy to interpret useful

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,830
and must be mapped at all stages so this

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,590
helped a lot but then you realize that

00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,720
for the roads they were going higher in

00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,790
stage three and we found out that those

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,980
were because in our contest in form I

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:25,480
ever said those were usually the fourth

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:27,850
parts which we found it a bit difficult

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,230
to sort of identify in the satellite

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:33,670
imagery even though we did some of them

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:37,180
that they were all useful in a way so

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:39,090
for the roads we like I said earlier in

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,770
terms of the common patterns across the

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,500
the the stage two and stage three

00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:46,810
we found that our the the grant

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,510
estimates or state to estimate say three

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,910
estimates are about eleven to two four

00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:56,320
eight percent more than the online

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:58,810
marking estimate and so yeah in the

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,010
summary in terms of factors influence

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,130
equality we're talking about density

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:04,720
rooftop architecture mapping skills and

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,350
of course they are likely to be more

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,189
which are not explode here so far I've

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:14,920
not talked about the awesome platform

00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:17,470
which we found useful in terms of the

00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:21,400
data destruction the historical data

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:25,420
that we used for this analysis and also

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,790
the study points two points towards a

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,830
framework for understanding spatial data

00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:37,360
quality are different mapping stages

00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:39,280
leading to or some update so in terms of

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,440
future work or potential future

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,440
opportunities we are currently working

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,570
on combining participatory mapping and

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,280
automated methods because now we have

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,740
some sort of

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,950
data we've gone to the ground we have

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,809
the ETA we have also data at stage two

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,720
just using the satellite imagery we have

00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:01,090
data on the ground verified the data so

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,559
this is very interesting when you want

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:09,190
to apply or machine learning methods for

00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:11,110
example also there could be an

00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:14,020
opportunity for improvement of workflows

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,740
and mapping tools and also a standing

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:21,940
impact in terms of multi-level

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:24,840
collaborations so thank you very much

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,840
for your attention

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,780
[Applause]

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:38,830
Thank You Godwin for another very good

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:40,690
talk with interesting findings we'll

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:53,289
take questions now there's plenty of

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:54,940
time go ahead really interesting and I

00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:57,730
would love to talk to you afterwards I

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,230
do a lot of work around workflows and

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,830
field mapping for hot and it'd be really

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:05,020
interesting to collaborate the statistic

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,929
I think it was like 18 to 37 percent of

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:11,080
the buildings you can jump to that that

00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:14,289
would be helpful yet less than the

00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,659
online mapping and estimates and we

00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:19,030
actually have found the same thing from

00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:20,679
Botswana to Guatemala and Liberia during

00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,770
field mapping activities I would say

00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,409
very similar percentage for us we've

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:32,080
which is really cool to see it validated

00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:34,270
through your work as well for us well

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,289
see a lot of these are there's been both

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:39,760
urban and rural areas and I'm I'm

00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:42,309
curious because I've always attributed

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,220
it more to imagery and I was wondering

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:47,620
did imagery date come into play for you

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,030
guys what was the imagery dates that you

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,520
were working with was there a big

00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:55,669
difference yes yes certainly certainly

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,409
so this was 2000 and

00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:02,429
20:18 and it was I think the gap was

00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:04,139
about six months yeah so you're right

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:06,860
and even if you have the current date

00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:10,309
even today with the experience in

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,600
Bangladesh one of the slums there is

00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,389
unbelievable if you go there the next

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,730
week everything has changed some

00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:19,649
structures demolished others built it's

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,860
unbelievable it's unbelievable

00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:27,019
but for some places like Sasha some of

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,019
the same you know respect accorded ages

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,480
hi super cool that was really

00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:38,580
interesting um I have a question about

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,190
the buildings that you omitted after

00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,799
doing your field work did you do any um

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:46,889
like spatial statistical analysis to

00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:48,749
understand like what it was about those

00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:51,990
buildings whether it was like areal

00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:53,850
extent or like their orientation

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,230
compared to other buildings like were

00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,539
there any patterns that kind of came up

00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,960
and the structures that you did have to

00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:03,059
remove after doing the field validation

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:08,009
oh yeah that's a very good question

00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:09,480
thank you I recall going through that

00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:11,399
bigger science I was sort of

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:16,200
anticipating questions around those

00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:19,169
things so some of them if my memory

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,710
serves and right most of them like when

00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:24,720
it comes to especially the updates the

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,399
state 3 once they've gone to the field

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,779
and have come back with 50 pairs and all

00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:30,090
that you're doing the collation

00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:31,950
conflation it's always the case that

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:35,700
their instructors where they have like

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:38,429
three buildings to merge but then how do

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,009
you how do you do that you know and you

00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:43,529
in a way initially they were like

00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:47,580
deleting and creating another like just

00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:48,779
to met to cover the three and then I we

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,759
were thinking about we were trying to

00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:53,220
avoid delete you know as much as

00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:55,889
possible so we try to for example just

00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,139
use one geometry of the three and extend

00:21:55,889 --> 00:22:00,360
it like that and then clear the other

00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:03,330
two as much as possible things like that

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,960
so but then there could be other reasons

00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:11,040
which have not explored yet

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,040
we have time for a few more questions

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,450
thanks Godwin for the presentation just

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,820
a couple of questions so the first one

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,100
is related to the previous one so on the

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:24,070
field you when you do the ground truth

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,500
survey you see that there are many less

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,150
less and less buildings is these only

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,270
due to the fact that buildings are not

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,580
there or only or also the fact that

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,559
something was seen as a building from

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,920
the satellite but was not a building or

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:40,630
something that was seen as you know more

00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,700
buildings attached to each other that

00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,410
actually was one single building and in

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,150
this case how did you serve it because

00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,960
of course you can take pictures on the

00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:52,179
ground but it might be not so easy not

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,650
to survey a building and this is the

00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:56,200
first the second is I saw in your

00:22:53,650 --> 00:23:00,340
workflow that you also use open data kit

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:03,040
can you maybe elaborate more on why did

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:11,140
you use it for photos or questionnaires

00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:14,050
and second one so the second one we

00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,309
wanted to go offline so that was the

00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,530
main reason so we're trying to find

00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:17,890
solutions offline and then come back

00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:23,760
online

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:27,010
you know surfing and we explored methods

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,790
and we realized that we could just sort

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:33,580
of create tiles after after we've done

00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:36,130
the update Stage two we could just

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:40,059
create tiles loaded in open data kit

00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:44,200
because it allowed us to first see what

00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:46,570
has been digitized from the satellite

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,200
imagery and then we could just place a

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:52,570
node at the center of the of the

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,600
structures and later majid so we create

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,309
nodes linking that to odk so we have a

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,520
questionnaire so we asked a question

00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:02,500
like so now identify the structure

00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,630
because we realize also we tried with

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,670
GPS it wasn't working in terms of

00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:09,280
identifying the structures so but then

00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:11,200
it helped with a decade help with at

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,380
least orient orientation so you have the

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,840
GPS sort of function that will show the

00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,870
data collector roughly where the you're

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,580
standing in

00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:23,990
like that and then they have to really

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:26,990
figure out where the structure is and

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,920
and locate that as part of as a response

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,230
to that question

00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,420
and then that would take it the aina so

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:35,960
it basically it was just going offline I

00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:38,240
would say yeah which also has

00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,790
implications especially in data size the

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,100
device and if you want to go scale it up

00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:45,320
you know in terms of area because we are

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,570
talking about small areas in this

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,650
context you know then the maximum is

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:57,160
about one point to two square kilometers

00:24:50,650 --> 00:25:06,440
maximum area size and then the other one

00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:08,330
sorry I forgot it oh yeah yeah yeah so

00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,980
yeah yeah this is something that we are

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:15,260
looking into why this is the case but so

00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:18,260
far is basically the for the trainings

00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:21,080
like try and identify all structures so

00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,750
so far as the satellite imagery suggests

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,059
is a structure you know of course

00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,100
mapping skills and all that is also my

00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:31,190
play a part in that but then so far as

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,750
it suggests so then we zoom in this is

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,740
the case and we also the free

00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,770
distraction because it's going to

00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,450
retarget so it tagged us buildings and

00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,570
if it's building dense like we use that

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:44,900
as a basis to go to compare that with

00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:47,990
the stage three I don't know if I

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,490
answered your question but yeah so of

00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:53,000
certainly there are some arrows around

00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:55,910
that in terms of interpretation stuff

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,090
for example nizam busty because of the

00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:02,750
rooftop made the architecture there it

00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:04,820
was almost impossible to to identify the

00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:07,160
building footprints so we could actually

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,860
one of the recommendations would be just

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,780
even we sat in such a situation you

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,020
don't need to even map the buildings at

00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:17,270
all but we found the road networks very

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,790
useful so you could just mob the routes

00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:21,260
and just go to the field this one thing

00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,940
we found very

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,650
that there's no point to my beauties

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,960
doing that industry if you find it very

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,580
difficult to interpret the satellite

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,309
images and there's no pointer and that

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,320
we might solve this question I think or

00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:40,150
you're worried in this question you know

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:43,309
as to you know how to thank you for this

00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:46,280
there's the last question but also we're

00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:48,679
out of time so go ahead and ask it but

00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,290
people might may come in and out so okay

00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,150
it's really quick I I understand

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:56,150
previously you were using printed field

00:26:53,150 --> 00:27:00,679
papers for our use is that true

00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:04,040
have you stopped if so why we are still

00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,600
using it but then we want to build on

00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,850
the experience we have so first we

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,120
wanted to test it and so with this

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:12,380
experience we want to go further to

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,840
understand for example one difficulty is

00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,600
once you've done the field papers you've

00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:21,640
done the annotation and all that coming

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,809
back to the the OSM to update is

00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,090
something that the map s were like oh

00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:29,110
there's a lot of work you know and we

00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:34,100
must we must find a way to sort of

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:35,330
release relieve them with this burden at

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,600
the moment we don't know there could be

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,130
some I know we have is a possum that we

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,980
were trying to explore posting which

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,350
allows you to sort of deploy digitally

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,540
with a nicer printed it out printing the

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:49,940
people hardcopy you know and then

00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:53,770
deploying it on the tablet and I'm going

00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:57,890
there to map and then going back to the

00:27:53,770 --> 00:28:01,760
the conflation to update the OSM data

00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:06,770
database yeah we explored that and later

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:10,360
stopped at some point because yeah we

00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:12,350
wanted to go completely offline yeah

00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,679
thank you I don't know if I answered

00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:17,780
your question okay thank you Godwin

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,340
thank you very much and we should move

00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,600
on to the next talk

00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,940
[Music]

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,049
