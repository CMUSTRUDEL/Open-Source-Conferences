Title: 2019: ODbL license compatibility
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2019
Description: 
	Have you wondered if a certain dataset can be used for OSM? What does it mean for a license to be “compatible” with OSM and ODbL? This talk will give pointers on where to look for information, common compatibility issues, and best practices for presenting a license to LWG for help review.

The talk would go over tips for mappers to help them think through potential license issues for imports. The tips would cover all the major steps for determining compatibility: identifying the data's license, check OSM-related history, identifying/resolving compatibility issues, and achieving community consensus. 
This talk will be useful for any mapper with compatibility questions or who is interested in importing open data into OSM. 
 
Outline:
- Sources of information about the license
  - Website (page from which data is downloaded, about page, FAQ, TOS)
  - Accompanying file (e.g., README, LICENSE)
  - Terms, credits, etc.
  - Metadata
- Information about licenses/dataset previously evaluated for use with OSM
  - Imports wiki page
  - License compatibility page
  - forums/lists
- Common compatibility issues
  - Attribution
  - Use restrictions (e.g., noncommercial/personal/research)
  - Privacy
  - Sharealike
  - Revocability
  - Indemnity
  - Local laws
  - Things that are usually not a problem (disclaimer of warranty/accuracy, trademarks, governing law, ) 
- Making it easy for others to read a license
  - A note about translation
  - Link everything!
  - Include all information about the source
    - Where to obtain
    - Description of where/who the data is from
  - Include all information about the license
    - What the license is
    - Any info about permitted uses
    - Any prior OSM discussion
  - Flag common compatibility issues and why you think they are or are not issues
    - Quote the relevant sections of the license (include the section number!)
    - Explain your reasoning
    - If the license references other laws/regulations/terms, look them up and link to and quote from them.

pillows no good so I know you're gonna

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,420
have a lot of questions for our three

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,890
speakers this afternoon we're gonna go

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,660
on time so I want to make sure that

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,339
there's time for questions I suspect

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,970
that Kathleen Lu is going to have many

00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:31,800
questions

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,390
if you have a question please put your

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,460
hand up and our folks here will try and

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,930
help it my name is Heather I'm on the

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,400
August EMF board and I'm really honored

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,540
to be here to have this conversation

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,720
with you guys

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,340
Kathleen would you hi everyone you hear

00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,620
me okay all right great so for those of

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,410
you who might have seen this talk at

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,890
state of the Mack us I did change the

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:59,400
slides so you won't be completely bored

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:04,739
I did not change the jokes so please sit

00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:08,009
Leo laughs again so my talk is about the

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:12,890
compatibility of data sets into osm

00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:15,450
based on OSM's of open database license

00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,500
so you know this is what I'm gonna talk

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,390
about I'm going to talk about the law

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,520
the license just give you a quick

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,630
overview of why were you know dealing

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,510
with this situation what it is that the

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,700
legal situation involving Mac data but

00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:33,659
then we're gonna go into sort of

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:38,220
examples of practical advice of how to

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,920
find license data what to look for when

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,320
you are looking at that license to see

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,370
whether or not is compatible with osm

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,460
and of course sharing that information

00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,340
with the legal working group which I am

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,380
a member

00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,320
and what the community-at-large so we

00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,570
all benefit from your research so the

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,150
disclaimer at the bottom here this says

00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,610
this is a very long acronym what it

00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:07,570
means is I am a lawyer but I am NOT your

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:11,350
lawyer so this is not legal advice this

00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:13,720
is just some things that you know I've

00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,209
learned a little bit over the years and

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:24,430
as a member of the working group we

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:28,810
would like to see okay so the open

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:32,320
database license you can go and read it

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:37,390
it's kind of long it's kind of wordy

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:40,300
there's it can be a bit of a headache to

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:44,530
read but the key things you need to

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:48,010
remember for purposes of when you want

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:53,160
to import data or you want to trace data

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:56,739
into OSF is there is a share like clause

00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:01,209
that means that whatever data you put

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:04,720
into OSM needs to be sub licensable so

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:09,190
like license back out on terms that are

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:13,120
compatible so if you the license that

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:17,799
the data is under if it can't go out as

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,489
ODB L then it's not compatible the other

00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,799
thing to keep in mind is if you see I

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,380
know the text is probably very small you

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,200
probably can't actually read any of that

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,390
but there are already many many many

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,870
data sets that have been imported into

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,959
OSF and what that means

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:39,360
is you know we oh s M is attributing to

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,220
these datasets there's a webpage so it's

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,900
kind of a long list there's a link

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,519
there's like if you even more or less

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,409
and of course you go with this change

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,780
sets and there's you know details of

00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:51,870
every little for every little bit of

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,790
data that's added that means that to the

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,010
extent that a data set has an

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,890
attribution requirement it needs to be a

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,730
flexible one we'll talk more about what

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:08,879
that means with some examples later ok

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:11,609
so Mac data what the law that protects

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,530
map data is very different jurisdiction

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:19,530
by jurisdiction so we're here Germany

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,320
Europe the entire European Union has

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:25,590
what is called a sua generous law for

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,850
protecting databases that means it is a

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,800
law cific to databases my set so you

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:36,449
know exactly what kind of databases are

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:39,630
protected what they're protected from

00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:42,590
and how long they're protected so that

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,840
is different than copyright law

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,270
copyright law is you know generally

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,900
right it's for things like books and

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:55,010
movies and their scope of copyright law

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,020
tends to focus on creativity

00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:00,979
the thing about creativity is that

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:05,039
databases tend to not be very creative

00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:07,470
there is an argument about you know the

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,320
selection of like what attributes you

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,260
include in the database and you know how

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,990
you list that information that that

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:19,320
might be creative but a fact like the

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,520
fact that like this building is that

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,669
this location

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,270
there's nothing creative about that and

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,930
so there is this inherent tension

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:32,020
in map data between you know

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,620
copyrightability as sort of the

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,449
usefulness of that database there are

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,729
two sort of competing theories of

00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,650
copyright one is called sweat of the

00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:44,440
brow and it's sort of like the idea of

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,569
like the more work that you have to put

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,840
into something in order to create it

00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:53,770
that is what makes it valuable and

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,660
deserving of protection and then the the

00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:00,099
other theory is sort of like you know

00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:02,349
copyright is designed to encourage

00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:04,389
creativity so if there's nothing

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:07,030
creative about it if you are gathering

00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:09,759
facts that sort of exists out in the

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,409
world then you know maybe that's

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,539
protectable by something but it's not

00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:18,280
caught it's not copyrightable it's not

00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:20,919
what copyright law is for so you have in

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,680
a lot of countries where there is no

00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:26,830
suah generous database protection law

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,460
there's just no copyright protection for

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:33,070
facts at all so like the u.s. is a good

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,690
example of a jurisdiction that has a lot

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,690
of law developed on the subject

00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:48,870
so whenever you are looking at a data

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:52,290
set keep in mind that what the law

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:55,680
actually is differs from jurisdiction to

00:06:52,290 --> 00:07:00,180
jurisdiction and a lot of people are

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,600
imprecise with how they describe IP and

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,620
how they describe licenses so you know

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,260
go back to the source and look at what

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,530
the license actually says if there is a

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,830
license you know sometimes you know

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,750
people will just like say that like they

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:23,160
own something right like people might

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:26,730
have a public domain like a good example

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,590
is Shakespeare so all of Shakespeare's

00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,630
works are in the public domain because

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:34,350
he wrote them a long time ago and he

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:38,190
died a long time ago but a publisher can

00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:40,310
still you know take a play you know put

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,590
a nice cover on it write an introduction

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:47,190
forward maybe some footnotes and then

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,900
publish that book and that book is owned

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,820
by the publisher but only the new parts

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,680
that the publisher at it so they're

00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,170
still going to write you know in the

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,220
book copyright you know big publisher

00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:02,160
right and then you're not gonna tell you

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,810
exactly like you know this is the but

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,980
you can figure it out you can go and

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,980
look okay well this is the original

00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,420
Shakespeare this is what's new and you

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,400
can just cut out all that yourself you

00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:15,870
know toss that out and then you have the

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:19,710
public domain stuff that you can use but

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:24,030
you know osm it is a global project it's

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:27,630
for use by everyone for a lot of

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:31,140
different things and so we have to take

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,400
care of it by looking carefully what's

00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,740
the data

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,470
that we put into osm because you know

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,840
trying to take it back out right is a

00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:42,180
big pain and also you know you might be

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:48,290
causing trouble for other people who are

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:48,290
using it so this is just be careful

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:55,530
so the other area of law that affects

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,530
datasets and what you can import is

00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:02,490
contract law so a contract is an

00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:05,190
agreement between you and maybe the

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,070
person who gives you access to the data

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:13,170
that you might do certain things or not

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:16,940
do certain things and that agreement is

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:19,260
sort of between those two people now

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,080
sometimes you will not be allowed to

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,620
have access to some data unless you

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,360
agree to the contract right and you can

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:32,280
sort of make the choice of whether or

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:35,490
not you want to agree it but just

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:38,790
because it just because it is written

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:42,300
that you know the condition for access

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,440
is X doesn't mean that X applies to

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,500
everyone in the world

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,920
it applies to everyone who accepts the

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,560
condition right if somebody does not

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,880
accept that condition then they're just

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,680
that whatever protection is exists is

00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,370
governed by what we talked about

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,590
previously

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:05,250
all right copyright law or database

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:08,280
protection law you know sometimes you

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,590
have to click on something or interacts

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,770
s it you know make sure you read what it

00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,500
is that you're clicking on because

00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:20,130
sometimes I'll tell you whether or not

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,890
you can put it into SM but you know if

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:27,610
you don't read maybe maybe you won't get

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:33,440
sued maybe not probably

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:35,090
so in terms of practicalities of finding

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,900
this information right

00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:40,430
you know you might go onto a website

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,380
there might be like a link to some Terms

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,670
of Service a lot of times that's just

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,980
about the website it's not about the

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,200
data so you might have to like go find

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,730
an FAQ just about the data there might

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,120
be like another page that says dad a

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:55,400
license sometimes that it's like on the

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,980
page with the data sometimes it's like

00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,670
in the download file you just have to

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:05,570
kind of click around and look for it and

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:10,540
of course other mappers have done a lot

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:13,760
of research so past imports but also

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,780
sometimes mappers have looked at

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,910
something I said

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,970
you know like this is probably not

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:22,400
compatible because you know we oh I

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,530
found this and the license and so it's

00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,510
not imported so it's like you know

00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,420
there's a lot of places in a wiki that

00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:35,750
have historical information that can be

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:42,070
very useful so this is a relatively new

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:47,390
page that the lwg has added where we

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:50,090
just looked at some different we sort of

00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:56,420
gathered the information of historically

00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:59,270
what LLG has evaluated and put all that

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:02,840
information onto a page there's a lot of

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:05,030
details into the reasoning of what you

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,410
know what you know the conditions are

00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:12,800
and why this is just like a very general

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:18,920
summary so I encourage you to to look at

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:21,710
that when you're looking at a license

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,190
for data to see whether or not that is

00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,519
can

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:28,040
well with OSM the main things that you

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,980
should look at these are the main things

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,079
that you should look at so as we talk

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:38,149
about attribution whether it's a

00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:41,589
flexible attribution a lot of data might

00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:48,199
have like a non-commercial limitation

00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:51,949
and for OSM because you know the anybody

00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:55,329
can use osm right companies can usm they

00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:57,620
can also resell that data if they want

00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:59,930
though you know they need to link back

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,750
to us um so then you know other people

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:06,500
can go and download it for free of they

00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:08,959
want but you know a non-commercial data

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:13,069
said that sort of limitations not going

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:15,430
to be compatible there is this is not

00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:18,079
super common but sometimes especially

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:23,120
government data sets they might have a

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:26,000
requirement that you update the to

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,029
whatever their most recent update of

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,759
that data is and osm you know we try to

00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:34,880
keep the map like with the freshness

00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:37,990
information possible but we can't always

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,029
promise to have the most recent

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:44,899
information in there so that sort of

00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:49,670
condition it's not going to work

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:51,800
there is also sometimes some governments

00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:58,790
might put out a data said like this is

00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:01,850
for use within say Germany or with it

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:04,939
and you know whatever country and OSM of

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:13,040
course is a global project so the data

00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:16,430
needs to be usable in all countries we

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,490
can't have data that where the license

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,010
says

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,510
it can be revoked at any time for any

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,840
reason

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:30,330
there are certain conditions where it's

00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:32,520
okay because you know for example like

00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,070
if you violate the license right like

00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,770
that's a pretty common one I can be

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:42,300
revoked if you violate there are also

00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:43,620
some privacy considerations sometimes

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,020
you know the government's will say well

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,970
if we accidentally release like a list

00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,240
of people's birthdays we need to be able

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,220
to you know cancel that fortunately we

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:58,020
don't map people's birthdays into the

00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:00,630
map so that is something that you know

00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:06,750
you just have to look at exactly what

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:11,420
that particular law license says but a

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:17,190
lot of times that can be okay so

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:21,230
indemnity clauses are when is when a

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:24,510
license will say like you promised that

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:29,190
if anybody were to sue us

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:32,840
because of your usage of this data you

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:37,340
will pay you you know to defend us

00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:43,220
essentially os MF doesn't have any money

00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:47,930
we can't afford to pay to defend anyone

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:51,120
so unfortunately we can't promise that

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:54,140
sure like clauses usually in general

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:58,050
just not compatible with each other so

00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:00,600
it's a fortunate but each share alike

00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,460
license tends to be just written a

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,770
little bit differently and

00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:07,470
when they each say well you know

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,899
everything has to be licensed under this

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,970
license and this leather license is how

00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:15,120
it has to be under this license even

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:22,470
when they're both open licenses they're

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:25,080
almost never compatible so just to give

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:28,950
you some examples of what I've talked

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:33,080
about here so this is the UK's open

00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:37,740
government license so this is version

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:40,920
3.0 so this is this parts nice so simple

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,950
this is about what you can do to do with

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:48,570
the data so we can copy it you can reuse

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:53,580
it you can use it commercially and with

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:57,589
other data so that's very nice this is

00:16:53,580 --> 00:17:01,740
sort of the big condition on it right

00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:04,709
where you have to attribute but as you

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,780
can see it says that you know if you're

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,720
using information from several

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,670
information providers and listing

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,170
multiple attributions is not practical

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:19,760
you can include a link so this is an

00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:22,920
example of a very clear flexible

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:30,750
attribution requirement in a license

00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:32,460
which is which is nice so this is a

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,260
couple of examples of what I was saying

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,160
about sort of like conditions

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:40,590
you know privacy protective conditions

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:44,100
trademark is all often carved out in

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,720
these licenses that's fine you know osm

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,860
is just going to sort of identify the

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,580
source and not use the marks and no

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,580
commercial manner

00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:02,010
and the you know no warranty that's fine

00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,260
you know osm it's not gonna go and sue

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:10,980
some data source and say like you know

00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:15,030
your data was bad so this is a previous

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,860
example this is a this is the previous

00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,230
version of the open government license

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:24,980
this is version 1.0 which is not

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:28,350
compatible with OS m and because this

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:34,409
previous version has this very sick

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:37,860
attribution requirement and so that was

00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:44,070
decided that it was not flexible enough

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:45,659
and you can see one of the big

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:50,340
differences that there's no mention of

00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:54,450
being able to use a link such so another

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,039
example is Canada this is the open

00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:01,289
government license which is adapted from

00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:04,650
the UK version one thing that's you know

00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:06,360
I want to point out is this definition

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:10,409
of personal information which is a

00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,570
reference to a section of Canada federal

00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:16,140
law so when you're looking at this make

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:18,000
sure to check what the license you know

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,130
it might be pointing to something else

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,500
in this case there's nothing in the

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,360
Privacy Act that's concerning its

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,799
defining a sort of like what you would

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,510
normally expect you know like birth

00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,630
dates and stuff like that but you got to

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:34,140
follow up and go and actually find that

00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,960
section and read it to make sure that

00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,409
it's okay you know

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,020
so the I won't read this whole thing but

00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:45,059
if you're doing your research so you

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,760
know here's an example where you got a

00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,090
check where the data is coming from so

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,480
this is

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:53,860
you United Nations office for the

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,090
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs

00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:00,910
there field information services section

00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:03,820
so they have datas basis under a whole

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:07,390
bunch of different types of licenses if

00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,730
you see this one was listed as under OD

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:14,350
BL which is the same license that OS m

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:20,590
is under and it says but it also says

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:23,170
that it's deprecated and but then if you

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,300
click on that link you go to the updated

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:27,250
data set actually says that the updated

00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,910
data set is public domain which is even

00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,460
better

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,890
it's even more flexible and it can be

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,630
used for anything so when you are

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,120
looking at these things make sure that

00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:39,580
you check the source and make sure that

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,150
you follow through and like look at

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:45,640
everything to get the whole picture

00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:51,100
here's another example also from that

00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:54,430
same webpage so this is administrative

00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:57,790
boundary data for Pakistan and it says

00:20:54,430 --> 00:21:00,790
here that it's for humanitarian use only

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:03,580
now obviously OpenStreetMap is used for

00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,960
humanitarian uses but it's also used for

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,930
a lot of other things including

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,780
commercial uses so you know to check

00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:12,300
this you go to the Pakistani census

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:17,370
office where it says the data is from

00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:21,330
you know they talk about their data and

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:23,580
they talk about a why

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,580
they think about how like you know they

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,559
will sell the data but you know if you

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:33,330
get the data you can't give it in your

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:35,820
videos and it explains that you know

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,549
they are sort of charging different

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,230
prices to different people because of

00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:44,700
how much it costs the government to

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:47,070
obtain that data but as you can see they

00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:53,359
will give it to certain agencies

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:55,499
including the United Nations for free so

00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:59,190
I've been giving this thing off the talk

00:21:55,499 --> 00:22:01,739
faster so if you if you find some data

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:05,369
you don't know what the license is you

00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:07,529
can ask the the source but don't ask

00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,950
them you know is this compatible with OD

00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,389
Beale

00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,690
because a lot of people don't know what

00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:15,149
oh D bail is and don't ask them if the

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,429
data is open because people have

00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:19,379
different understandings of what open

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:21,629
that is some people think if it's online

00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:23,609
if you can see it it's open and other

00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:26,070
people think it's not open unless there

00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:27,239
are like no conditions at all right so

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,830
don't leave that open to your

00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:32,279
interpretation and be really specific

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,179
you ask you find out you know the things

00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,619
that are important to find out are

00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,090
things like is it the government's data

00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,100
or does it actually belong to a third

00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,109
party and the government can't even give

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,980
the permission what are the restrictions

00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:44,249
on it

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,409
yeah ask about that if it's public

00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:48,149
domain that's very helpful to know but

00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:50,100
if it's not you know what are little

00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:53,070
like what's the license and if there is

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:56,549
a potential conflict with odl then ask

00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:59,879
for a waiver so this is actually a

00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:02,580
really nice example that from Australia

00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:05,399
and thanks to Andrew Harvey for pointing

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:07,409
this out to me where they they actually

00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:08,880
wrote into the contract with their

00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:11,340
imagery they

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,080
hire someone to go out and take imagery

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,980
of the area they actually run into it

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,860
you know we work with osm and this needs

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,200
to be able to go back into OSF and so to

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:25,260
the extent that there is a conflict with

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,450
cc-by which is the normal license that

00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:32,150
we're gonna put this out under you

00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,150
acknowledge that that conflict is waived

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:41,220
and there is an example of a CC by

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:47,070
waiver template in the in the in the

00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:50,430
block and then last make sure that when

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:53,550
you do all this ratures and do all this

00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:56,580
work that you put it back somewhere that

00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:58,170
other people can find it you know put it

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,240
up on the wiki include all the

00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,400
information include all the links like

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,440
when you tell people like point to the

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,970
subsisted sections of the license don't

00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,820
