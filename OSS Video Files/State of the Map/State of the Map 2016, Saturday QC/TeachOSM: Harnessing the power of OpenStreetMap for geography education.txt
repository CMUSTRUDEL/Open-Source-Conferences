Title: TeachOSM: Harnessing the power of OpenStreetMap for geography education
Publication date: 2016-10-19
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Saturday QC
Description: 
	Maggie Cawley at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/teachosm-lets-revolutionize-geography-education-worldwide/

TeachOSM is dedicated to making OpenStreetMap the on-ramp to a rich world of open source mapping tools and educational activities. Because of their low cost and relative accessibility, OpenStreetMap and the related ecology of open source geospatial tools are ideal for teaching the fundamental concepts of geography and mapping.

This talk will feature case studies of TeachOSM workshops in the Caribbean and Mauritius that focused on the use of OpenStreetMap, open data, and QGIS. These projects show how teaching open mapping techniques contribute to strengthening economies and providing accurate maps of the local communities. OSM has led to the delivery a new generation geospatial tools that have the potential to improve geography education. Join Maggie and help make a plan to bring OpenStreetMap into classrooms all over the world.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
the right so we'd start this session

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,910
with Maggie Corey who is from a

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,610
boomerang geospatial and she will talk

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:25,439
about teach osm or nursing the power of

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:29,970
osm for education see beaucoup good

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,410
afternoon I'll try to be as upbeat as

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,140
possible because I know everyone just

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,940
filled their bellies so just bear with

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,739
me I trying to try to make the slides

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,300
very simple in case we had any glitches

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,360
as well so you everybody can follow

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,010
along thank you for coming my name is

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,590
Maggie Kali i'm here to talk about teach

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,239
osm how many people in the room have

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,190
ever heard of teach osm awesome all

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,730
right well I guess if you don't that's

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,730
why you're here

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,960
I'm gonna start with a big statement the

00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,560
osm is at the forefront of a revolution

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,440
in education I say this for many reasons

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:19,659
as we know openstreetmap is a very big

00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:21,250
tool and it actually teach osm is based

00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,530
on the hard work of probably everybody

00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:28,090
in this room and teacher sm is born out

00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:30,310
of that so open source tools is behind

00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,560
this it's there that changing the way

00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,020
people are learning what was before

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,190
behind closed doors is now out there in

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,780
the open and it's adding an alternative

00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,960
and augmenting traditional educational

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,429
education I think worldwide I'm going to

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,420
speak to this from an American

00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:50,470
perspective because that's where I

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:53,590
learned and and currently don't move but

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:57,159
where I have mr. my experience so I

00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,659
forgive me if some terms are not the way

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:05,470
that you speak about education but I'll

00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:08,080
do my best so traditional primary school

00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,849
in K through 12 geography education in

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:19,000
the United States is in definite need of

00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:21,750
CPR slowly fading away plus you even

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,280
universities are losing it as a subject

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:28,060
what I heard the Ivy League schools have

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,370
taken in a way as a major and I think

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,390
only 13 out of 50 states actually has as

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,580
a subject in school I did a little bit

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,360
of research and it it's pretty

00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:43,360
depressing here's one thing i saw that

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,390
between 2002-2012 this is a I found this

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,959
on National Geographic the page there

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,670
was zero dollars allocated in the US

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,370
federal budget for education in

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:59,080
geography and to me that spells out a

00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:02,980
big problem there's some more fun stats

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,370
if you look at those links one small

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,860
hope I've recently found out that AP

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,650
courses Advanced Placement they were

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,940
kind of like an elective in high school

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,840
our teachers can elect to teach a

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,019
subject and students can elect

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,810
and geography became an AP course I

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,700
think around 2011 and now it is one of

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,680
the largest and fastest growing in the

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,750
u.s. many teachers are choosing

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,940
geography maybe because they see it's

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:37,549
deficient in other areas and the GIS AP

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:39,379
course has also been approved I have the

00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:40,760
belief that open geo tools can

00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:46,580
strengthen the role of geography and

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:49,730
education geography is in everything we

00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,709
do world is about place and I think the

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,540
definition of geography if anybody in

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,120
the room is a geographer if I get this

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,239
wrong with is the study of humans in

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,980
their environment so it's it sets itself

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,489
up to be pretty inclusive from the

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,500
get-go and I cgo playing a different

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,410
role in education because it can be

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,629
integrated across curriculums you can

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,069
lose it if anybody wants shout out of

00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:18,650
class we can come up with a way to use

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:20,810
it I bet and openstreetmap steps in

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,210
because it's real it's open and it's

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:30,050
accessible and as a learning tool I

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:32,750
think it has a lot of power for the

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,000
project I think it means good things if

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,130
more teachers are teaching openstreetmap

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,410
and more people are learning

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:42,430
openstreetmap you start to build a

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,740
pipeline of spatially trained

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:52,789
relationships you aware humans all over

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:54,830
the world so the teach osm project

00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:59,210
caught this because it's it's not a

00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:01,460
website it's not a team it's something

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:05,180
that people have been working on to

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,470
share education and share knowledge the

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,570
idea is to consolidate all those

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,760
resources i think i've heard talks all

00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,070
week about trainings and people teaching

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,660
osm all over the place and and right now

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,590
i think a lot of those resources are

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,570
scattered around the world so one of the

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,729
ideas of the teacher some project is to

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,010
consolidate all that and structure it a

00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:26,180
little bit so that you can figure out

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,289
what your learning objectives are and

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,300
then find that on teach osm

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,919
and I also want to say it's a community

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,659
it's not Authority you know I contribute

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,330
to the project and there are a few

00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:39,659
pillar members at the moment and but

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,800
it's starting to grow if I go time to

00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:43,589
point out if you've looked at the site

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,050
lately thos a morgue we recently pushed

00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:48,389
it in German so now it's also available

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,889
in English and German and I think that's

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:55,080
just the beginning of the translations

00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:58,979
that are going to happen for the site so

00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,319
the mission of thos M is to promote and

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,759
advocate the use of openstreetmap to

00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:08,279
teach the fundamental concepts of

00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:10,439
geography and within teacher sm i think

00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:15,089
a lot of curriculum has been developed

00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:17,219
around community and university doesn't

00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:18,479
seen a lot of vocational training and in

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:20,309
this talk I'm going to talk a little bit

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,229
more about K through 12 in the primary

00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:24,059
school and and what's missing there I

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,830
think it's a there's kind of a hole in

00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:33,330
the curriculum and then we can start to

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:35,879
address so how do we do that I'm

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:39,180
starting where I am so we thought of a

00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:41,849
program called map for America and are

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,029
looking to the US census to create a

00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:47,339
partnership where the census identifies

00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:49,080
areas in the u.s. that are lacking with

00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,629
information geographic information and

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,689
they put them on tasking manager let's

00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:57,659
go through the workflow we teach

00:06:54,689 --> 00:07:00,449
teachers across the u.s. how to teach

00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:02,430
their students how to use openstreetmap

00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:06,719
and then they begin digitizing these

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:08,610
areas you can go out in the community

00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:12,209
and ground truth so you have a little

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,339
bit of more validation teach osm or the

00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:16,800
community they verify and then it goes

00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:20,309
back to the census and it shows up on

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,939
openstreetmap so it's a way of getting

00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:25,979
geography into pretty much any class and

00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,539
the curriculum will be built based to

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,830
the common core standards because that's

00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,629
a problem in the u.s. I don't know about

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,479
anywhere else but there's government

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:35,159
standards on what you need to teach so

00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,349
by doing that at the beginning you kind

00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:40,039
of make it a little more open for people

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,039
and accessible

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,290
here's a small vision something where

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,560
you can think about what you're teaching

00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:51,840
and I'm a science teacher how can I do

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,020
environmental mapping so you go in your

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,090
12th grade instructor you say okay

00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:01,400
here's one that we go out and map all

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:04,500
the trees and around our school you know

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,480
this is a lot of work so with map for

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,260
America we're looking to start with 11

00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,640
and 12 I mentioned before the AP

00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:15,240
geography teachers this is much better

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,250
when I speak into the microphone as a

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,280
fastest growing group learning geography

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:22,770
in the u.s. so to start with them seems

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,710
to make the most sense in 11 that dwells

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:28,530
grade is where you have your AP courses

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:32,100
so in November at the geography 2050

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:34,470
court conference in New York we have 50

00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,690
AP geography teachers who are going to

00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,300
present this to about participating in a

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,120
pilot project how to get this into their

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:48,210
classroom and what they need in order to

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:51,000
teach osm I think it has a lot of

00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:57,720
benefits for educators they get ready

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,070
made projects their students are shown

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,690
geography in different ways they're

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:05,280
given real tangible skills there in the

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,380
map they're working on real-world

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,020
projects so i think is a student you can

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,360
connect a little bit more to that and

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:17,190
how many people think osm is just pretty

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:23,700
cool how many people have heard about

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:25,260
geo badges great I didn't build do it

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,840
badges but i'll just mention it it's

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,640
some credentialing system based on

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,410
independent learning so if you if you go

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,270
to geo vadas sound of work you can

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,360
scroll through all the whole different

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:39,510
badges and there's ones for i'm an osm

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,370
editor i'm an osm trainer so the idea is

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,960
to tie these credentials into the

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,360
courses so that students and teachers

00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,880
have a way of measuring what they've

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,980
done and it's also incentivizing and

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,750
gives people motivation to say today I

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,019
got three badges there's a Peace Corps

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,189
badge there's a Girl Scout badge

00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:58,069
so you can take all these different

00:09:55,189 --> 00:10:04,220
things and five courses and you get your

00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:06,410
Girl Scout badge benefits openstreetmap

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,899
think I said it's starting to increase

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:11,600
participation and diversity across all

00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,239
generations and it can be around the

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,069
world so you're bringing in people

00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:19,939
you're exposing young people to

00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:21,470
openstreetmap and teachers who may not

00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:22,790
have gotten interested will have an

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,279
easier way to bring technology into

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:30,850
their classroom in a less intimidating

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,850
way so we're growing the community I

00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:34,759
would say if i wouldnt street map

00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:36,619
doesn't make its way into a classroom i

00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,360
think it would be pretty sad but i think

00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:43,819
it already is and i think it has a good

00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:51,230
project projection and future everyone

00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:54,170
benefits and it's a way to show if you

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:58,100
have a structured unstructured

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,869
curriculum around osm it's an easier way

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,089
for people to access curriculum that

00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:06,829
they know is high quality and will work

00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:09,139
in their classrooms so one of the ideas

00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:11,029
of talking today is to tell you all

00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:13,040
about it and hopefully get people to

00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:14,629
participate you know what if you work on

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,429
a score if you've created training

00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:18,769
materials or you just want to help

00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:21,350
translate existing materials if you have

00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:23,149
a case study if you taught students

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:28,360
anywhere in the world we'd like to hear

00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:31,549
about it share those with us connect and

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,990
highlight those successes and also or

00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:37,420
maybe it didn't go quite right that

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,420
maybe we can help in the future I

00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:41,389
thought this was pretty funny but

00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,860
wouldn't it be great if we had a lot of

00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:49,369
minds like Albert Einstein in the

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:51,369
geography community as a young man my

00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:53,869
fondest dream was to become a geographer

00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:55,819
however while working in the customs

00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:58,339
office I thought deeply about the matter

00:11:55,819 --> 00:12:01,549
and concluded it was too difficult a

00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:04,639
subject with some reluctance I then

00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:05,900
turned to physics as a substitute isn't

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:12,710
that a shame

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:15,770
okay so the basic of education is shared

00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,540
knowledge so if that's not open I think

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,400
we're doing something wrong so let's

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,920
talk let's share and let's start

00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:48,230
educating everyone how to use teach how

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:50,930
to use osm thank you any questions hello

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,450
I'm unusual in being a chartered

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:56,450
geographer from the broad geographical

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:59,630
society in london um I was wondering why

00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:01,820
do you think the geography curriculum in

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,560
America in particular has fallen to

00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:11,270
where it is now in terms of what you've

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:12,890
highlighted on your slides earlier is

00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,240
that too difficult flowers for your

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:25,760
different one maybe we should talk about

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:27,530
that on the side okay so this is really

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,300
a question but a comment teach osm

00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,890
website is fantastic if you haven't gone

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,300
you should check it out it's great not

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,860
just for students but also for makka

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,330
thongs for you know teaching community

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,590
organizations your neighbors whatever

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,250
it's got all kinds of awesome resources

00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:43,280
i just want to give another shut up

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:45,580
thanks Andrea mm-hmm I didn't ask em to

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,580
save

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,240
I'm wondering thanks Maggie for this

00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,100
conversation I'm wondering how we get it

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,370
into more languages I worked in the

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,630
arabic-speaking world for a while and I

00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,920
asked on the mailing list it was it

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,200
would there be anybody interested in

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,700
helping me get it into Arabic and I just

00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,399
didn't have the time because I was busy

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,990
with other things but I'm wondering is

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,570
there like some thoughts around how do

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,980
we get more languages and what could we

00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,690
connect with translate Without Borders

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,690
or something like that to help Thanks

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,920
yeah I think thanks to Stefan Keller he

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,149
kind of paved the way and made it a

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,490
little bit easier to start that

00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:27,550
translation process my other thought

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,050
about that is that I think a lot of

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,690
material already exists in other

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,790
languages and may it may not be cookie

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,839
cutter the same I think that's important

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,330
too that it's coming from a different

00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,160
cultural context and how its taught so

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,500
bringing in those existing materials is

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,630
a probably a pretty good place to start

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,730
and then we can build from there if

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,800
people want to help translate what's

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,020
existing on the site so you have it

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,760
simple seamless way to click between the

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,130
languages that's great but if if we

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,610
start by bringing in case studies and

00:14:54,130 --> 00:15:01,510
curriculum from other places I think you

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,220
can go from there yeah I'm following her

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,770
I think there's a lot of interest is

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,480
also in translating into Spanish at

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,580
least including me there are three

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,400
people here that would be very

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,790
interested on it the other thing is like

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,300
have you planned to thinking about

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:22,450
trying to make a more successful

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:25,540
successful results with the teach osm

00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:29,560
platform maybe have you tried to make

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:31,570
some sort of gamification features into

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:38,400
the platform so that way you could

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:38,400
implement more informa teaching awesome

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,230
thanks i'm going to start to answer that

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,399
question that i might turn it over to

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:49,020
our web developer but um I have with map

00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,940
for America the idea for that at least

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,560
what I'm kind of thinking is finding a

00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,830
way to start creating a sustainable

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,510
ecosystem around this so building in you

00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,730
know I'm a teacher and I'd like to teach

00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,010
osm how can I do where should I start

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:05,520
where's the training so some kind of

00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,260
input mechanism and I think it's a great

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,080
idea because we have it we have the

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,029
email but I think I hope that it becomes

00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:16,770
overwhelming to answer sorry Steven

00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:18,660
Johnson or Nuala so I think there's

00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,640
probably a more efficient way and I

00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,180
think we can talk about that and maybe

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,180
figure it out

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,630
okay great thank you so much and thank

00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,630
