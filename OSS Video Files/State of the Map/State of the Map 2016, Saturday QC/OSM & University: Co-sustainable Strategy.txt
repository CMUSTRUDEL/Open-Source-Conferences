Title: OSM & University: Co-sustainable Strategy
Publication date: 2016-10-19
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Saturday QC
Description: 
	Yantisa Akhadi stands in for Vasanthi Hargyono at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/map-it-forward-incorporating-osm-into-universities-curriculum/

Original title: "Map it forward: Incorporating OSM into the universities curriculum"
What started as a spontaneous day of OSM training for a very eager lecturer & his 15 students has now grown in to fully developed training method. Last year this method was used in 13 universities to certify more than 50 students as champions/trainers in their provinces. 5 universities have incorporated OSM into their curriculum.

Vasanthi will discuss that initial project in Makassar, the biggest city in East Indonesia. Learn how it led to a massive explosion in map contributors (900k buildings are now mapped), and how it developed into an educational program. Having access to free map data has already paid dividends â€“ the city government used the data to create an accurate flood contingency planning.

so let's resume and the second talk is

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:11,700
given by a young tisa a caddy from

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,540
humanitarian OpenStreetMap tina of

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,490
indonesia and we talk about osm and

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:24,350
university coats and stay in their

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:27,779
strategy hello everyone good afternoon

00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,670
my name is y NT sahadi probably

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,619
initially you expect that it should be

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,989
fecon t who study for the presentation

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,390
but unfortunately she just got

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,120
scholarship for the master degree in

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,460
australia so and this week she needs to

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,700
have like a preparation study the

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,670
preparation so she couldn't make it to

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,770
the event so I'm replacing vasanti but

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,550
and the title is a bit different with

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:59,010
what you might expect but I ensure you

00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:01,079
that the content will be similar ok so

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,159
probably first I will give you a

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,130
background context about what do I mean

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,460
with the US and university and how it

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,580
can be like Co sustainable strategy so

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:20,460
probably if for you who don't know where

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:23,009
is Indonesia so this is Indonesia we in

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,630
Indonesia where we have been working

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,640
since 2011 the reason of why hot have

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,060
project in Indonesia is initially

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,710
because of this software so this is in a

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,740
safe this is a software called in a safe

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,079
so basically in a safe combines one set

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,470
of exposure data with one hazard

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,049
scenario and then it will provide with

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,630
produce maps reports and action so for

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,360
example if there is floods happens in

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,659
Jakarta we know that where are the

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,130
affected roads and where are like the

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,469
affected buildings and we are the

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,490
affected population so it just take one

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:05,820
by one and then we got the result so in

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,950
order to achieve this because in the we

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,229
need osm as a way to collect the

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,230
exposure data so exposure here what

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,860
women with exposure is population

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,270
buildings and row

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,580
that might be affected by disaster so

00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:23,520
and the only reliable way of acquiring

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,370
this information and in a wide scale is

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,680
through osm it's something that's

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,170
natural because the other way is either

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,750
you collect it by yourself which that

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,790
can be expensive and it can take quite a

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,210
long time and then the other one is pay

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,330
a third party data which is which can be

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:47,220
like quite expensive and this is how it

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:49,140
starts so in 2011 Kate Chapman is gift

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,810
the first training to the University of

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,030
Indonesia in Jakarta and initially we

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,180
also got our first two trainer that is

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,640
Amir and this is for Santi in 2011 so

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,709
this is how it's everything start so if

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,170
you want to collect the data in the

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:08,790
national level then the only natural

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:12,570
thing to do is set up a team of trainer

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,370
because we need people that understand

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,010
what is OS I am how to collect the data

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,380
and how to put it into the platform so

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,500
that we can use it for the disaster

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,110
management so that's the initial idea

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,880
and even from the very beginning we

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,799
already like working with the university

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,690
because we believe they're the one who

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:37,200
understand the local contacts they know

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:39,420
how to adapt they know how to like like

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,720
this one like what we produce initially

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,330
this is basically a training material

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,709
that is adapted into indonesian although

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,450
the one that i present here is the

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,970
english version because we always

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,010
produced in donation as well as english

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,500
version this is initially come from the

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,600
learn osm dot or and then we adjusted

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,130
the content we adapt the content into

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:04,709
indonesian contacts and then we also

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,360
create like training modules the

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,540
curriculum we also develop the

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,840
curriculum on how it can be adapted into

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,549
the local context and like for this one

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,430
the data collection using openstreetmap

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:20,549
can be taught in three days and then the

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,700
QGIS and in a safe can be taught in two

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:26,760
days we also have other project with the

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,280
Wikimedia Association this is called

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,410
this is

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,080
for the open content in Kalimantan we

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,240
also adapt that and creating the icon so

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,240
that the youth that is involved in the

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,530
project can be interested and also

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:46,080
easily learn the new skill or in using

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:48,730
osm so i will give you a two story about

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,620
two of key story about how we deal with

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,930
the university the first one is the

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,300
university competition and the second

00:04:52,930 --> 00:05:00,040
one is about the unplanned training but

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:02,200
it turns out to be really really well so

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:15,610
the first one is about the university

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:17,740
competition play a video this one so

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,430
this is padam padam is located in a west

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,010
sumatra in to town but in the past

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,200
decade there is a big earthquake and pad

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,870
rang like thirty or forty percent of

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,080
Padang is destroyed like the there are

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,720
lots of casualties as well and then in

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,090
2011 we're thinking of let's set up a

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,750
university competition where let's

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,640
compete on how to mapping in osm with

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,370
there will be like five winners and the

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,890
five winner from each University will be

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,080
flown to the US at that time to come at

00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:53,470
the phosphor G and state of the map in

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,880
denver colorado so this is what happened

00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:00,000
during that time this is pardon you can

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:08,010
see that is fairly blank at that time

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,210
start blinking a bit this is also where

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,669
initially tasking many tasking manager

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:16,570
is also initially developed in indonesia

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:19,740
and this is like one of the initial

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:23,080
large-scale mapping project that was

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,610
done in using tasking manager that is

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:30,580
for the city of padam that's why here

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:33,750
this is like the date or when the osm

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,750
tasking manager was launched

00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:44,380
this is also like the this is the first

00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:47,350
biggest mapping effort in national level

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,330
in Indonesia but the winner of the

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,610
competition they were like like five

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,490
student and they are flown to denver

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,280
colorado at that time and then they

00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,690
coming coming back to Indonesia and

00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,600
unfortunately this kind of competition

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:04,060
is not we are no longer like using it

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,800
often why because one of the five

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,270
mappers when they come back they decide

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,150
I just want to work with insurance

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,730
company so he no longer wants to map

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,280
hill no longer interested in mapping so

00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:18,130
he just decides commercial are probably

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,830
much better to me for me so we're

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,270
thinking that in terms of sustainability

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:27,060
it's not something that's really well

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:29,410
this doesn't fit really well in terms of

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,060
collecting the data in a short amount of

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,010
time competition might be a good way to

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,790
do that but it's not necessarily for the

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:42,310
sustainability we this is not something

00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:44,500
that we would like to repeat so we also

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,420
have training afterwards with the

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,870
disaster manager and partners because we

00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:52,360
believe the data would give a much more

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,700
benefit if we also teach it to people on

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,650
how to use that and we believe that at

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,390
that time it will help the disaster

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,330
manager and partners that hey now you

00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:03,070
have the map of Padang you can use that

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,280
you can download all the building and

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,930
you you know if the next tsunami or the

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,870
next earthquake happened what you need

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:14,890
to do what's the contingency plan so we

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:17,230
see the importance of this osm in the

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,200
context of disaster management but we

00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:26,800
also understand how university is having

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:30,100
critical role in it the second one is

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,450
the unplanned so if the competition we

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,460
are initial thinking hey let's have a

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,560
competition it must be great it must be

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,960
really nice for those university they

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,430
will compete they will have a new skill

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,170
and there when they're getting back

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,570
there will be like a professional mapper

00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,250
which did not happen but there is the

00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,640
other way there is a other thing that

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,150
happens other way around so then the

00:08:48,640 --> 00:09:01,160
second story is in

00:08:50,150 --> 00:09:04,100
sir this is second video so at that time

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,860
there is a lecturer that keep on nagging

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,050
Kate Kate Chapman the executive director

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,880
of hot at that time and he kept us on

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,920
nagging on Kate through Facebook and

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,660
saying hey please give me training I

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,910
want training there's a lecturer in one

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,800
of the University in makassar I want

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,740
training I want training he keeps on

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,790
sending message and at one point gets it

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,990
ok ok I will visit your province and i

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,240
will give you training because at that

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,860
same time there is an occasion where

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,440
they are training for disaster manager

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,730
for the government official on the use

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,310
of osm for disaster management and then

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,370
they act like 22 days to teach the

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:46,600
lecturer and also some of the student in

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,600
mapping and this is what happened in

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:58,820
less than a year and then we also have a

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,430
workshop for disaster manager to use the

00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,470
data to utilize the data as well that's

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,630
a follow-up what makes it really

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,960
interesting is apparently the teacher or

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,460
the lecturer really a top osm how he can

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,340
really adopted he make it as an

00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,320
assignment so every semester he asked

00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,930
for each of the student to make 500

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,870
building and 100 roads and he make it as

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:23,060
a way of assigning the pass and making

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,940
of marking the task if you map it really

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,340
well you get an A if you didn't if you

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,800
didn't map it really well kind of ok

00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,350
i'll give you be but if it's you map it

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,570
like rampantly there's the lines not

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,680
really straight the building is bad see

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:42,050
or you may not pass the subject so even

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,700
the lecturer make it compulsory so that

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,220
for all the student to make their own

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,660
area so it was also interesting he wants

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,300
all the student to make the areas around

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,750
where they live so you need to make 500

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,790
building and 100 roads and now even the

00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,430
same lecturer makes it into business

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,360
model when there are some commercial

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,519
entities looking for

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,279
the complete map of Makassar he sells

00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,930
the data and he sounded like he gets the

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,029
money but for the surface on how to

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,550
profit the shapefile so get so that you

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,380
can have like ready to use file rather

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,820
than you need to download and then you

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,519
make some kind of processing through

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,130
QGIS you get the you get the shapefile

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,110
of the whole data and he sell it now he

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,390
has another idea of mapping of the

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,959
mini-market surrounding the city and

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:30,029
again that data can be sold and like if

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,980
you want to make up a new branch of mini

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,360
market then you know we're used to set

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,089
up an office because you know like the

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,310
distribution of it but and it is also

00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:39,779
quite common in Indonesia that the

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,850
lecturer would ask several of the

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:44,370
student who joined the project and paid

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,529
them and yeah like small amount of money

00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,959
but it for student that will be well I

00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:52,529
get paid of doing this and also good

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,779
good mark I have good marking as well so

00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:57,990
that's what happened in my past and

00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:02,550
that's also one of our inspiration to

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:05,180
replicate this success story to other

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,180
place in Indonesia

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:18,000
so in 2011 in 2013 everything seems

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:23,160
going really well we have 58 trainings

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,019
we have from 38 4000 buildings into 1.2

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,120
millions and again this is all happens

00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,310
we can because we have a team of trainer

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,220
not because we we map Indonesia

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:34,230
ourselves but there is a problem with

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,700
this because there are problem the first

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,839
problem is with the government and the

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:43,410
NGO and also like with the local

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,480
community like if we already trained the

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,339
government official for example the gov

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,990
people from the government we train them

00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,089
on how to use or sm and everything else

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,760
but when they get back they keep on

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:56,070
doing their old job making coffee and

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,380
then making copies of papermaking report

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,230
for their buses so nothing changed so

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,829
it's like change resistant and then or

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,120
if there is a talented people who really

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:09,000
having a good experience in the

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,519
OpenStreetMap he can do mapping she can

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,459
like really map it in detail but then

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,410
when secret back to the office not for

00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:19,230
long then he get transferred to another

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:21,630
office like for example to the Ministry

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:25,470
of Health for example which it did not

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:27,540
have like direct use of the map so this

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,130
is one of our big challenges and then

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,899
the second one is from geek to damasus

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,300
people still think that Oh SMS is

00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,339
something so geeky not something that is

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,930
public something that people can use

00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:40,320
something that everyone can benefit from

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,570
it so the solution is we propose at that

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,250
time the University roadshow this is 13

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,790
University that they've been involved

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,410
with and with these 13 University

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,020
initially we open up an announcement

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,180
open public announcement if you want osm

00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,870
training in your campus please contact

00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:00,480
us and if you can but you need to

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,730
guarantee that you can help with calling

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,410
people and then organizing the space so

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,300
that we can come and have the training

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,250
you don't have to pay us to come you

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,959
just need to provide the place and the

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,980
facility and then we will do that and

00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:16,649
this is what happened so initially we

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,240
have like several face the first one we

00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:20,850
will have socialization like we

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,529
introduced in what is osm and then do

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,499
you intercept if you want do you want

00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:28,009
osm training after

00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:30,529
but we introduce to you and then there

00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:32,479
will be people signing up so at some

00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:34,279
place it goes really well this is the

00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:36,319
Hasan odeon University the University

00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:40,549
where we get the idea to engage with

00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:42,079
them and then there are also like cases

00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:44,839
where there are 0 even after

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,139
socialization it seems so successful we

00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,839
have 148 participant or like this one we

00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:53,269
have 91 but then it goes really low

00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,579
during sign up why this happened we also

00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:57,889
learn that rather than working with the

00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:01,039
student directly because sometimes we

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:03,349
also accept application from student

00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,879
body but the student body is not

00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:07,759
sustainable next year you'll have

00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,069
different committee different people and

00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,109
it's like keep on rolling I mean with

00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:15,769
the new batch of student then there will

00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:18,589
be changes in the student body structure

00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:19,969
but then with the one with the lecturer

00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:21,589
with the faculty if you have a

00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:23,689
cooperation with the faculty then

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:26,059
usually they pick make it integrated

00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:28,849
into their own system in terms of like

00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:31,099
hmm i can use osm in my this subject or

00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:34,129
i can use osm for this purpose like in

00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:36,459
this lab so that's where it gets more

00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:39,259
sustainable and we get much more

00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:41,419
attendance during the first workshop and

00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:45,139
then the first training and the second

00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:47,299
training so what also makes it

00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,449
interesting is that we also developed

00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:51,529
the certification program so we create a

00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,599
workflow that the first it will be

00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:55,669
socialization and then there will be

00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,919
sign up and there will be awesome

00:15:55,669 --> 00:16:00,889
training there will be pastas and

00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,419
private coos it so that you can join the

00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:04,459
next training and then there will be

00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,769
tough be cooked before you can be

00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:08,929
certified and after it is certified you

00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:13,099
can be either data collector facilitator

00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:15,619
or junior analyst so because we make it

00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:17,089
also a bit of competitive that for

00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:19,909
product miss it for example if you have

00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:22,159
done the osm training and you want to

00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:24,679
join the beginner key geez and in a safe

00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,869
then you need to do one of these tasks

00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,519
you can choose either plan a mapping

00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:30,139
project based on the team that the

00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,119
parson choose for example I want to map

00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:34,459
all the health facilities surrounding

00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:36,379
the campus or I want to make all the

00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:38,720
restaurant I want to map all the chip it

00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:41,340
and then the second

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,710
they can also do the same small training

00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,110
like saying hey Junior do you want me to

00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,180
help you with osm and then he trained

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,610
the junior they trained the junior and

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,870
then write a blog post about it and the

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,600
same the third one is to file it

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,610
validate the data like they look at one

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,520
particular area and they check whether

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:02,610
the osm data is nice or whether it's the

00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:06,449
needs some adjustment and then after

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:09,000
afterwards after the they can join so we

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,650
assess so if they pass this requirement

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,410
then they can join beginner key is

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,839
beginner kiddies and in a safe and then

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:18,480
there's also like pastas boss tests and

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,579
tasks where they need to do like this

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,290
series of tasks that is data acquisition

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,630
run disaster scenario using in a safe

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,430
and then make map layout using in a safe

00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,000
map composer so that it will have a

00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,500
product and if the student past that

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,390
then you'll have certified students so

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:42,840
we ensure that the quality is preserved

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:44,520
so there are after the evaluation of the

00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,880
first University Roadshow we goes into

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,980
the face or the part two where we now

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,960
focus on the interest and future

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,910
integration potential we are looking at

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,220
the new University some of them is

00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:59,790
already joined the previous unit show

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,520
because this university already have a

00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,380
plan on how they can integrate osm into

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,450
their own system integrate them into

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,640
their own into their own curriculum and

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,260
we are focusing more on not teaching the

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,880
student but we are teaching in the

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,120
lecturer and or the assistant lecturer

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,890
who also teach in the lab because if

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,530
they know this then they know that

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:22,980
probably some of part of this that I can

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,900
use for my own teaching material I can

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,910
use this for my own laboratory so that

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:30,320
there will be likewise I'm practice and

00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:32,790
then we also expect that there will be

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,090
actual collaboration with the local

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:40,140
Disaster Management Agency because the

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:43,290
lecturer will have much more interest if

00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,900
what skill that they just got is also

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,090
useful for the government and it can

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,380
create also collaboration between the

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,380
government and university

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:58,510
so even up until now we already have

00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:03,160
recruited a training we done 117

00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:05,140
trainings seventeen provinces and 2,800

00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,010
participant in total there are four

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:12,700
point two million buildings being map

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:16,180
from this is a high increase from 1.2

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,430
million in 2013 but this is all could

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,320
not happen without the role of the

00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,750
University and we believe that in

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,970
universities also the way forward if we

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,460
want to replicate all the success so

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,830
what is to be on university road show if

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,080
it's already finished what will be what

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,150
would we do next the first one is the

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,040
concept of osm hub there is one

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,660
potential University again that's the

00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,590
Hassan uddin University because they

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:43,650
have a bit by Indian we are in currently

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:46,810
in the process of an MoU with the

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:51,100
director with the the whole University

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:52,450
of develop this osm hub the concept is

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,610
that there will be likewise FF

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,980
coordinator there will be three division

00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,140
research and development which focus on

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,330
experimenting what is the new tool in

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,040
osm what is the new technique what is

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,260
the new methodology that we can use in

00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,560
mapping and then the training is how to

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,720
implement that how to disseminate the

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,700
new and the new newly acquired knowledge

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,170
and then outreach is more on the

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,600
marketing again to make it sustainable

00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:19,240
we need to ensure that the data that was

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,010
collected is can be used by anyone not

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,780
necessarily by disaster manager but also

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:26,140
like for business for example for the

00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:28,900
private companies because in the past

00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,790
several year hot in Indonesia is trying

00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,040
to shifting the paradigm we are not

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:37,210
focusing people a little chip to teach

00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:40,840
them on how to how to how for them to

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,910
contribute their data or or how they can

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,790
contribute an osm but we are fishing

00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:48,220
that focus into how osm can benefit them

00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:51,400
how they can benefit from osm what they

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,080
can you what is the use osm relafen with

00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,150
what they're doing right now because we

00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,220
believe that if they know the importance

00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,530
if they know that how benefit it is osm

00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,480
then they will also care about the data

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,700
they would care about contributing into

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,690
it because that would also directly

00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,840
impact them and

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:12,019
also recently have partnership for GIS

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:16,009
course so the there is one new business

00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:18,259
school in Jakarta that asked our team to

00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:20,990
develop the whole curriculum like can

00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:25,759
you please teach GIS and location-based

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:28,070
surface but we want these two courses so

00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,080
adapted into enterpreneurship because

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,309
they want to develop a new enterpreneur

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,379
they want to develop a new start-ups in

00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:37,940
information technology and they want to

00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:40,190
use osm they and they believe because

00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,340
that's the way forward they want to be

00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:45,710
unique that is also the needs from the

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,779
university itself so that it would not

00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,000
be like the same or other university

00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:52,279
that use ArcGIS but they want to be

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,950
different they want to be a university

00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:59,379
that have advantages like in using open

00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,379
data using open source tools thank

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,270
are there any questions

00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,260
thank you thank you for the presentation

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,510
I have a question forum about the

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:34,600
financial support for the trainings in

00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,520
the university do you get a financial

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,930
support from the University themselves

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:44,050
or other partners that can find okay so

00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:47,080
for the uni Roadshow like for the first

00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:49,660
and the second part we got funding fun

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:53,260
funded by Australian eight because

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,520
Australian eight is have strategic

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,750
partnership with the National Disaster

00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:01,540
Management Agency and now like this

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:03,400
strategy with the uni road show is going

00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,700
to be adapted by the National Disaster

00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,610
Management Agency because the government

00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,260
did not have the capacity to map all the

00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:12,790
disaster prone area and they want to

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,360
also have this kind of project program

00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:19,180
into their own structure so we're really

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,920
relief that there is large buy-in from

00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:25,720
that but for the partnership with this

00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,880
business school yes we do get paid

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,730
although not a big amount of money but

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,130
it can cover our track transportation to

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:44,110
the school and like giving lecturer and

00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:46,300
giving practice to the student how do

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:49,200
you obtain the proper attention from the

00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,940
government from of voice and data and

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,810
attention and then the deployment okay

00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,340
okay so probably one of the capital that

00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,200
we have initially is because there's

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,790
already partnership with in Australian

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,100
Government and Indonesian government in

00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:06,520
terms of disaster management but I

00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,920
believe the big factor is because the

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,570
National Disaster Management Agency also

00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,700
have frustration with the National

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,920
mapping agency in acquiring the data

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,450
especially during disaster hey I want

00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,190
that data quickly there is a volcano

00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,890
eruption in that area okay give me like

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:23,290
three to six months that's far from

00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:25,330
enough to getting the data and then when

00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:28,900
with they know osm and we offer them the

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:30,630
surface do you want your our assistant

00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:34,510
and snapping your area and then we also

00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:36,280
like working with the University on hey

00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,480
let's make this area together then the

00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,730
government the nation

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,650
ramanujan medicine required the data and

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,450
they really love that they really love

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:46,390
how the data can be collected they can

00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:48,250
make a better accurate assessment or

00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,870
like how many building affected where

00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,640
are the roots that is affected so then

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,470
they can give a rag proper number rather

00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,080
than how many blinks affect that well

00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,210
probably around 10,000 or 5000 that is

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,490
something that's rough estimation but

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,350
using osm they can have more accurate

00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,799
information like there there is like

00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:07,570
8,000 building 8543 building and Arya

00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:11,260
which is something that cannot be said

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:13,900
if you're using your own estimation and

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,390
the National mapping agency is like a

00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,820
very centralized they didn't have like

00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,650
branch office on the ground and every

00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:29,679
province so that's also challenges for

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:31,809
them to also collect the data tremendous

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,770
work thank you very much for presenting

00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:37,690
it um you started off the story about a

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:40,480
student who went off and went into the

00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,790
insurance company and was not

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,410
sustainable do you have any reverse

00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,150
stories of what happened to your

00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,980
students after they've been

00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:52,330
participating with you here or there is

00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:54,669
there more retention in the field have

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,919
you seen that at all and then a second

00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:58,540
related question is how many female

00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,360
mappers do you have among your students

00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,940
do you have a lot of participation and

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,190
by female students and you know kind of

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,850
give me an idea about what happens to

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:12,100
them as well yeah oh we are starting

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,720
that process right now I mean because

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,730
they're also question from the donor

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,400
itself about how about the mapper

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,169
attention and one of the key finding

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,760
initial key finding we haven't really

00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:27,700
like a focus on this one is that most of

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,370
the mapper that still mapping is mostly

00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,580
male we have like female is quite low

00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:35,169
although like from the participant

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,290
participation there is one University

00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:41,679
that all the one that certified is women

00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:43,630
and we also have requirement from the

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,150
donor as well that require that wants us

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,130
to be more focused into women and we

00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:50,740
already planned several activities next

00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,970
year this is spoiler alert so

00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,520
are planning to have a project called

00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,290
women who map and then we will have this

00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,270
like in international women's day or

00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:00,160
enduring karti need a car t need a car

00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:02,309
teenies like a women role model in

00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,929
Indonesia and then we'll have like

00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:06,700
exclusive mapathon for all women and

00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:09,220
we're planning to work with the local

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,610
communities because we have been several

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:14,650
success story where women is the one

00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,880
that may really detailed in a very good

00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:20,980
quality even in our own team there is a

00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,140
title that is called queen of mapper so

00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:26,170
we have one queen of mapper that in a

00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,960
day she can map 10,000 buildings in a

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:32,020
very good quality so that's why we kind

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,570
of make her as a deity of your the guard

00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,850
is up oh you're the only one be able to

00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,160
do this because no man able to do that

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:42,280
in a very good quality like men gets

00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,200
bored easily so yeah we believe we

00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,850
believe that this is also the way

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:58,059
forward of making it sustainable in the

00:27:45,850 --> 00:28:00,130
future thank you ground verify or ground

00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:05,860
survey any of the areas that you've

00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:08,559
mapped yes so in several of our

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,540
activities it is also important that we

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,820
involve local community of local

00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:15,400
university that's why we have the United

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,160
show because we expect them like during

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,690
the osm training on the second day they

00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,190
need to go to the field directly and

00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,190
collect the data they collect the data

00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:26,260
using GPS using smartphone using pen and

00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:28,000
paper or using field paper so there are

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,040
several methods that we taught them on

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,570
how to collect the data directly and

00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,460
they're really love doing that because

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,290
often their frustration with the google

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,980
map is the their house is not being

00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:41,440
mapped yep and it is often like case if

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,910
your horse is not in google map then

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,370
means you're leaving either in very

00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:47,470
remote area or you're really like yeah

00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,500
you live in a very rural area so then

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:52,360
sometimes you get mocked by that but

00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:56,670
using operative map here I have my horse

00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,670
on the map you can see this yeah so yeah

00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,970
let's thanks young tease again

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,170
