Microsimulations of traffic systems require detailed input data about the road network, public transit, and land use (to estimate travel demand). At SOTM-EU Vienna, I introduced our simulation model (MATSim) and remarked that OSM had already become our preferred source for road network data. Since then, we have created several simulation scenarios from OSM, and we created a JOSM plug-in to export network data to MATSim (encouraging researchers to contribute corrections back to OSM instead of making them locally in the target format). I would like to report on the joint experience of the MATSim community using OSM data from diverse cities (including public transit tagging), and introduce traffic simulation to the OSM community at large.

let's resume with the second torque of

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:12,110
the second pot which is given by Michael

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:16,109
the risk from the Technische universität

00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:30,539
Berlin and he will talk about OS m for

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:33,030
traffic simulation hi yeah thanks for ok

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,010
first of all I'm going to tell you a

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,010
little bit what traffic simulation is

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,840
for the kind of project I'm involved in

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:48,840
which is a traffic simulation package

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:51,829
open source written in Java and to ease

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,370
my nervousness I will just show

00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:58,170
animation this is the is the scale of

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,480
the simulation so I'm talking about so I

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,920
don't I'm not talking about driving

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,290
simulator nor about a very fine scale

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,549
simulation which contains lane switches

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:14,909
and overtaking maneuvers but about this

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,040
kind of simulation where people want to

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,810
do things like being at home being at

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,979
leisure activities being at work and in

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,380
order to do these things they have to

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,960
move through a city and everybody else

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,780
is also doing that and I share the same

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,950
traffic system and we want to know what

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:41,130
what the outcome of that situation is

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:43,860
and the input to these kinds of

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,759
simulation is information about who goes

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,490
from where to where when doing what and

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,710
the output of this situation of such a

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,270
simulation or what the kind of questions

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,180
we hope to answer with such a simulation

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,729
is well congestions who is in that

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,710
congestion where do they live how much

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:07,409
time do they lose by being in congestion

00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:09,599
who's exposed to the external effects of

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:13,530
the people using the traffic system like

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:20,190
noise and other emissions and if you

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:23,520
public transit hopeful is which bus and

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:26,520
then we can um we can move on and can

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,100
try to contribute to questions like what

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,770
happens if we close a great job build a

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,390
new bridge introduce at all that's a

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,819
very nice sick thing to simulate because

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:40,980
it can have very unexpected effects

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:42,959
which already turn up in simulations or

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,860
make public transit free to use for

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,730
example and then think about how would

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,040
people react to that and when people

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,980
react to that and we look at the final

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,470
outcome who benefit benefits from the

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,470
final situation in comparison with the

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,030
previous situation and when you look at

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,310
policy measures ideally of course

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,709
everyone is better off after the policy

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,090
measure than before but typically there

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:13,319
are always winners and losers um like

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,209
when you introduce at all people might

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,769
drive around the road and go through

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,720
areas which previously didn't have a lot

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,670
of traffic and suddenly people who live

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,900
there exposed to more noise and they

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:30,989
would certainly not vote for that

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:32,790
measure and the input to such

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,920
simulations is twofold first we need

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:38,820
demand data and then we need supply data

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,299
the demand data is the kind of activity

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,430
patterns which I was talking about um so

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,530
you get these you need this kind of

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,880
information you need timed activity

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,859
diaries of people preferably with a mode

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,090
of transport they are using the reason

00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,799
they are traveling the times at which

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,000
they are traveling and where the

00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:03,859
activities are mmm you either take these

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,980
from a survey many communities to

00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:13,140
regular travel service typically about

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:15,090
about 1% sample size or less maybe or

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,370
you synthesize them and that works

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,930
approximately like like a creating

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,400
Dungeons & Dragons characters so you

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,680
have a set of rules and and

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,259
you can you can draw from the set of

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,729
rules and what comes out is a person

00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:29,870
with a realistic activity chain and the

00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:34,030
next one in the next one or the next one

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:36,650
and you can synthesize cities with

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,970
realistically looking people doing

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:45,979
realistically looking things mm-hmm

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:47,210
and now what is the simulation about the

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:49,190
activity chains in the demographic

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,789
attributes as I said either from survey

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:55,850
or or synthesized we typically consider

00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:58,039
them fixed and the routes people take

00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:01,820
and possibly the mode of transport they

00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:03,740
are using we consider flexible and due

00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:09,639
to the outcomes of the simulation rather

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:12,190
than inputs and how does that work well

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,960
first of all there's always this

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,760
economic assumption in there that people

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,970
use the best option available to them

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:25,039
unknown to them but consider what will

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:28,479
happen if you take for example OS R M

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,639
and let the population of a whole city

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,770
choose the best we will calculate the

00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,490
best route for the population of a city

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,440
to choose and then you simulate the

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,510
people using these routes the outcome of

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,930
that will be that there will be enormous

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:47,690
congestion and people can't possibly use

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,979
these routes in the way they were

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:53,870
planning to so choice is ie which route

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,520
to take and the state of the traffic

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,530
system which is the outcome of all the

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,820
people making those choices need to be

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:03,860
consistent so the travel times our

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,930
router uses in order to make route

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,710
suggestions should be the same travel

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:13,250
times which then emerge when people

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:15,830
follow these suggestions based on these

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:21,590
travel times how do you come to that

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:24,260
state why heuristic we we simulate then

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,909
we feed the travel times which come out

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,849
of the traffic flow simulation which

00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:30,289
I'll say a little bit later on back to

00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:32,960
the router and repeat and repeat and

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:36,240
repeat and repeat and eventually this

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,919
procedure converges to something like

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,500
and I could agree on where people

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,449
actually experience the travel times

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,289
with which they were planning you can

00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:48,720
program that in Java using anchored for

00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:53,039
that might up with with tools which are

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,050
all partially already available and the

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,660
final output of a simulation is then a

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,070
timeline of all the events on a person

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,169
level so you have people ending their

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,240
activities departing entering their car

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:05,699
going through the system on a link by

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,860
link basis and arriving at their other

00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,810
activity a final activity location at

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,699
the destination and then you can take

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,289
that output and make all kinds of

00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,990
analysis on that you can aggregate that

00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:17,990
back by where people live by social

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,710
demographic attributes by activity types

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:29,340
and so on and so on okay how does it

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:32,460
ways em help it helps a bit with the

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,349
activity generation phase so when you

00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,520
have these surveys and you ask people

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:38,130
where do you live where are your

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,849
activities you typically get that on the

00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,050
level of some zones which already exists

00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:46,680
for some purpose there may be cosplaying

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:49,139
or find range but when you want the

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,360
realistic looking simulation you need

00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:55,530
actual activity locations as in

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:59,550
coordinates and you can either pick them

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:03,210
at random uniformly it would look

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:06,030
something like this or you can use osm

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:09,479
buildings and land use tags and have

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:13,110
people only live where people live

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:16,080
according to OpenStreetMap or shop where

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,720
there are shops and suddenly the picture

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,270
completely changes if you distribute

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,110
activity locations in that way now this

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,970
is this was last not done with OS m data

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:33,949
but did this could have been done with

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:33,949
OS m data if for this study region the

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,560
it wouldn't have been the case that

00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:46,079
commercial data still looked a bit a bit

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:48,360
more complete but we're always M helps a

00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,380
lot actually and goes practically all

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,090
the way is

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:56,400
with a with a supply data with Network

00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:58,650
data so what kind of attributes do we

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,840
need for roads as I said we simulate the

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:04,110
traffic flow we do this based on only

00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:07,320
three attributes that is the the free

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:10,080
speed of a road segment which as one

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:16,640
speaker already remarked is not the same

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:23,550
as the legal speed limit but can be

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:25,140
sometimes inferred from it and then we

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,840
need one other important attribute so

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:31,110
that's the capacity of the road segment

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,050
in vehicles per time so how many

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:39,840
vehicles can pass this road segment per

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:43,260
time unit hmm and that can in a similar

00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:47,580
way also be mapped to osm Road types

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:50,280
pretty usefully and then there's one

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,170
final attribute which is when the link

00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,610
is full no more vehicles can enter so we

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,230
need the length of the link but that is

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:59,850
obvious and then then you get and when

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:06,870
this effect of course you get spill back

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:08,160
so and we get all these from the highway

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,760
categories so we have some kind of

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,260
mapping from highway categories to to

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,260
typical free speeds and typical flow

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:21,090
capacities and the one way attribute is

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:25,170
also pretty much usable and so we get

00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:27,030
our road network what we then typically

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:31,200
do is for example if we want to consider

00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:33,930
this city we take a very much larger

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,140
area for example the entire country take

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,930
the main roads from there and take all

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,370
the roads from the study area this is an

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,890
important step because when you when you

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,780
consider through traffic through your

00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:49,400
study area you would like to know

00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,400
whether people are entering and leaving

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:56,180
but now public transit and

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,620
we've been we've been doing the the road

00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,840
network part for several years

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,690
successfully now with only OpenStreetMap

00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,700
data but public transit is still a bit

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,990
more tricky so public transit at least

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,720
in our simulation system the following

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:16,220
properties it goes by a schedule in our

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,810
simulation individual buses are

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,190
simulated they drive around they can be

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:25,010
full right so no more can enter they

00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,480
take time to serve passengers right so

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,510
when more passengers want to enter the

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,720
bus takes a longer time to have them

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,550
enter people can miss buses and of

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,230
course people can have different

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,130
preferences for like different settings

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,020
for their public transit router

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,000
basically so are you sensitive to line

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,500
switches do you want to be you have the

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,920
fastest route at any cost and so on it's

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,620
on and the buses interact with

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,970
individual traffic now in many cities

00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,950
this may not be that important because

00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,870
you because those properties are fixed

00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,600
right if you've got a schedule you

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,740
expect the buses to be on schedule and

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,940
if not it will be due to a disturbance

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,770
but not in a systematic way but this is

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,730
not the case everywhere we go especially

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:10,130
if you want to look at planning

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:12,020
situations so what if we double the rate

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,450
of buses on a certain road segment it

00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,010
may be may very well be that you get

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,390
interactions with with private traffic

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,320
then and you will have private cars

00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:23,030
caught in congestion between passes and

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,910
so ideally we would like passwords fully

00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:28,160
linked to our road network and have them

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,520
go on the real roads serving reel stops

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,490
which are the real sidewalk at the real

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:41,720
link and not do anything virtual in

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:45,800
between and this already brings me to a

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:48,440
bit of - a bit of software with which

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:52,040
which which we saw a bit ago with nico

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:56,090
nico is here we needed visual feedback

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,260
for that right so we figured we would we

00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,250
would write a truss and plug it in and

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:03,320
the road network part of it is already

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:06,520
pretty stable so you can preview the

00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:09,790
link attributes free speed and and and

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:13,090
and capacity of which I was talking so

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:15,760
you can preview the way our or datum our

00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:17,940
data model interprets the OSM attributes

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,740
and you can make those changes there and

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:28,960
directly save the network and validated

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:31,420
before and looks like this so and you

00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,480
can browse your network you're being

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,540
edit anything here and now you also get

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:42,070
you also get public transit and that

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:44,350
gets interesting because when you for

00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:48,270
example download the network of bedding

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:53,110
run/walk a little bit of overpass

00:13:48,270 --> 00:14:00,220
you get buses you look at a single bus

00:13:53,110 --> 00:14:03,970
route looks like this of course every

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:13,030
tag bus route in Berlin is that cleaned

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:22,680
up public transit version too and when

00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:27,280
you simulate it it actually seems to

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:31,600
work so coming there it's going that way

00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,430
and the best one in the other direction

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,650
and they actually follow that

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:42,310
directional route variance and mmm this

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:44,460
of course only works when the public

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,870
transit technique schema is very

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:49,000
correctly and thoroughly used and in

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,210
Berlin that isn't the case for one

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,850
single route so we did this this one

00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:59,350
this one manually so this is this there

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,610
are projects like like like a PT

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,200
assistant which was already mentioned

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,510
here several times which is great needed

00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,010
appreciate it and and the the step it

00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,680
takes which is introducing intermediate

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,360
data model to do to do validation what's

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,459
the stop area what does it stop post

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:22,170
what is a directional stop and so on

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:22,170
is really really important mmm but then

00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:27,939
we also need a schedule all right and

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,670
Berlin is one of last time I counted two

00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:32,529
places in Germany which have public GTFS

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:37,149
feeds so we have the Berlin Brandenburg

00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:39,009
area and we have all who I think we're

00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:43,449
the first one to publish GTFS which is

00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:47,999
nice and when you know want to match

00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:50,920
GTFS routes onto open Street onto em um

00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:51,610
routes you get a whole new set of

00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,709
problems

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:57,399
which is the GTFS and osm sometimes next

00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:59,259
different well not so much the data

00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,569
format itself but the people who wrote

00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:04,059
the GTFS Feige and the people who tagged

00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:05,619
the GTFS routes sometimes have different

00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:08,079
ideas about what a stop is versus water

00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:13,990
stop areas and even the levels match

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:16,589
sometimes so and also I only found two

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:20,439
places in the entire world where any

00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:23,350
public transit entities in OSM seem to

00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:25,360
have any kind of information about GTF

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:34,660
about corresponding TGFs IDs attached to

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:37,600
them so I was wondering what do you

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:40,059
think what the prospects be often of an

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,709
effort like let's talk let's finally

00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:43,660
finish tagging our transit system talk

00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,999
for for for for what for for single

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,929
cities right you probably can't do this

00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:51,309
on a larger scale because you have to

00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:53,860
you have to consider the intricacies of

00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:57,790
your of your particular your particular

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:59,350
area and then try and take this take

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:03,429
this pity assistant approach and maybe

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:06,730
our our custom editor approach step

00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:11,079
further and make city specific tools

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,520
which which were the common sort of

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,140
toolkit which can be adapted to more

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,549
cities and to finalize open so you're

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,679
taking now I realize this is a very

00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,209
specific use case maybe not many people

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,899
are that much interested in buses

00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:26,799
precisely following the road network but

00:17:22,899 --> 00:17:28,929
um even for even if it's only for

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,330
visualization it's a very nice thing to

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:30,919
have

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,260
because you when you put people in

00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:35,419
planning situations and ask them which

00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:38,120
situation would you prefer going having

00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:39,799
the bus go this way or that way um it's

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,529
it's vitally important to have realistic

00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:44,200
visual feedback because if you if you if

00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:48,169
you do tricks there people will just say

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:51,679
what the bus line I used then doesn't

00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:53,570
look like this and not become become

00:17:51,679 --> 00:18:01,539
involved so I think this alone is an

00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:01,539
argument for trying to finish this and

00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:09,399
yeah our simulation which does public

00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:13,010
transit and individual individual

00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:15,500
vehicle traffic is free and opensource

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,970
focus on github but you need some kind

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,610
of input ater you need these activity

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,980
chains you can guess them you can you

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,570
can you can use coarse grained data like

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,510
workplaces and homes and just link them

00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:30,230
and and create homework home trips and

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:32,299
then you already got something to start

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:36,409
with it's not a GUI based tool it

00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:40,639
requires scripting to to to create your

00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:44,000
use case but you can do interesting

00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:46,250
experiments with it like if people are

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,080
lists of that price-sensitive and you

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:54,799
interview expose them to this or that

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:59,149
even linked all what they do yeah it

00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:02,419
separately XML based that's why we did

00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:05,500
this graphical editor experiment which

00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:05,500
turned out good

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:36,110
thank you for the talk are there any

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:40,220
questions great talk by the way I only

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:45,080
have 35 questions but it'll be quick how

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:47,720
many agents can you simulate and how

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,740
large of a network can you can you

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:55,250
actually deal in in your simulation and

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,260
do you have any parallelization some way

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:03,050
of making the agents talk to each other

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:04,130
and so on yeah I can easily simulate on

00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,200
my laptop

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:11,000
the typical sample sizes from travel

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:14,780
surveys I can on a larger large desktop

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:20,420
machine simulate an inflated population

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:23,840
of perhaps a 10% sample and with much

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:26,390
care and very big machines we can

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:31,360
simulate 100% of cities not a lot of

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:35,900
countries that's approximately the scale

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:39,860
the parallelization yeah the synthesis

00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:42,890
iterative replan simulate replan

00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,180
simulator you can simulate but well the

00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,040
planning steps of the agents you can

00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,950
trivially parallel lies they plan

00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,320
independently in every iteration so

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:55,550
that's easy the flow simulation is very

00:20:51,320 --> 00:21:01,550
hard to paralyze we don't get much

00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:03,800
better than 1.8 times the the sequential

00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:10,790
version in my experiments so it's really

00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:13,220
bad you mentioned loading XML data for

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:16,010
population how much are you able to

00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,990
estimate where people live strictly

00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,840
based on osm data like are you able to

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,270
are able to simulate the whole thing

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:27,280
strictly from where osm shows people

00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:32,210
living and shops and offices

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:34,400
we typically start with some kind of

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,080
survey population from a formal survey

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,500
the problem with these is that they are

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:44,780
very low sample sizes so we want to fuse

00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:46,940
them with other data and from the

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:54,520
outcome of this data fusion is that it's

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:57,400
then inflated as sample and for for this

00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:01,040
semi-synthetic population we need

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,500
activity locations because I can't have

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,690
the ten clones of my survey person all

00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,330
have all have them live in the same

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,830
house because that doesn't work so we

00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,620
have to district to redistribute them

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,570
and and and that's what happened in the

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,860
in the in the step which which my slide

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:20,360
was about so this is always a bit it

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,160
depends on the exact input data which

00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,700
you have and then you have to ask some

00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,410
some suspicions and and and and ask them

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,740
if this is small s sound what you're

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:35,780
doing and so this process is always

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:37,250
individualized but osm helps with not

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:41,000
having people live in the middle of a

00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:48,380
lake or in an industrial area which

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:50,900
already is a long way Markov chain

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:54,290
Markov model in a way of like you are

00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,420
saying that the road will be like six

00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:59,510
persons six cars no more cars will come

00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:05,810
on however you how is the logic behind

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:09,860
it um three the cars which travel on the

00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:11,990
network they are direct results of

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,420
simulated people doing things so

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:18,290
everybody has their daily plans in

00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:19,700
beforehand so there's no after the plans

00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,080
are fixed there's no random process

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:27,260
anymore people plan and then the

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,670
synthetic reality tells the people how

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,650
long they are in congestion on which

00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,450
link and then they experience that and

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,840
in the next iteration they do

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,840
differently

00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,630
thanks great talk

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:50,480
so you currently have like this way of

00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:53,809
deriving speeds from the road class yes

00:23:50,480 --> 00:24:02,440
did you experiment with better speed

00:23:53,809 --> 00:24:05,149
values from real vendors and okay no I

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,549
personally didn't and my office

00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:08,750
neighbors I think also didn't okay but

00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:11,090
what I would be interested in the

00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,850
traffic simulation does it simulate

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:16,419
things like rush hour then or would you

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:20,620
be able to basically having a set of

00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:22,490
speeds derive other information for

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,679
areas where there's no coverage for

00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,539
speeds yeah well the rush hour

00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:29,419
phenomenon is what we hope is

00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:31,100
indigenious to our simulation so we want

00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:33,019
the rush hour to actually happen in this

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,360
situation we don't we don't want to need

00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:37,250
to entreat input data for that in

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,440
addition to the travel plans of the

00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:44,570
people so we don't we are not so much

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,130
interested in only for validation

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:52,010
purposes maybe our calibration purposes

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:53,840
for for in dynamic travel times we we we

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,250
for us these two attributes free speed

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,850
and capacity are enough and they should

00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:01,370
be static and the dynamic aspect should

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:06,289
be endogenous to the simulation ideally

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:09,380
oh yeah thanks what is your model

00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:11,899
foremost choice obviously there's vendor

00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,909
lock-in or you know so what you said is

00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:16,309
you know the best choice how do you

00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:17,990
determine what is the best once I have a

00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:21,559
tool then probably I'm gonna use that

00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:23,809
tool every morning deciding on my trip

00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:26,510
yeah depends depends on the scenario of

00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:29,480
course sometimes sometimes we just leave

00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:32,600
it fixed we say people only only change

00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,519
their routes and and and they and for

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,980
the kind of trips were modeling and for

00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,690
the kind of time frame we're modeling

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,720
they'll basically not change that habit

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:44,240
depending on the question we answer when

00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:49,420
we let them when we open no choice as an

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:54,310
endogenous choice we need some

00:25:49,420 --> 00:26:00,520
estimate for people's utility function

00:25:54,310 --> 00:26:05,010
so we think that everybody as a utility

00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,010
function which is some combination of of

00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,250
the disutility of owning a car the disk

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,200
utility of spending money on public

00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:15,130
transit the disk utility of spending

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:18,580
time in in different in different modes

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:20,710
of transport and the disutility of being

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,810
late to an activity and these are all

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,930
parameters which need to be yeah

00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:27,220
estimated from surveys basically or

00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:30,640
tweeked until it looks realistic what

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:33,070
comes out of it but technically this is

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,230
what's happening so our agents calculate

00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:39,630
the utility based on parameters which

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,630
you can set and they optimize for that

00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:53,020
did you ever run into instances of the

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:59,650
brass paradox on yes and when a

00:26:53,020 --> 00:27:01,350
colleague of - is trying to oh I hope I

00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:04,690
summarized this correctly

00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,490
I think I won't

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,940
I won't even try she's she's she's

00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:13,390
trying to to find reword instances of

00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:15,990
the of the brass paradox in in in data

00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,990
