Since its inception in 2010, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) has coordinated thousands of volunteers in the creation of maps for humanitarian purposes. Contributors have traced satellite images and digitised field data in response to Typhoon Haiyan, the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the Ebola epidemic, and many other disasters. Despite these efforts, large parts of the world remain unmapped. With ambitions to fix this HOT are now trying to understand how to grow the largest crowdsourcing community on the planet.

Martin presents his research on this growth challenge. In attempting to understand how to recruit and retain an active contributor community, Martinâ€™s research has covered the initial contributor experience, understanding the practices and concerns of the community and reviewing how expertise is shared. The research involves large-scale quantitative studies based on the contribution history of thousands of participants.

okay technical issues seem to be

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,919
resolving themselves in QA so that means

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,990
it will also be resuming our session

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,070
here ladies and gentlemen please take

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:20,369
your seats perhaps a few more people are

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:22,170
coming out from QA in the meanwhile I

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,109
would already asked you to welcome our

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,150
next speaker he will continue on the

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:33,780
topic of the humanitarian side of

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:35,910
openstreetmap and applause please thank

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,350
you hello my name is Martin Martin

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,120
dishes and I research community

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,690
engagement with hots and with missing

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,879
maps I'm based in London and I go about

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,140
it in a number of ways but the two most

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,840
important ways is that I spend a lot of

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,000
time with the community with with

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,579
missing maps with hots with oak the

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,960
OpenStreetMap community but then also

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,670
spend a lot of time looking at the data

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,670
so I my key source of empirical evidence

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,000
is the OpenStreetMap edit history and I

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,490
spend a lot of time digging through that

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,260
if if maybe some of you have already

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,600
seen this i also have an Open Street Map

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,360
diary where I publish some of my

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,040
findings and commentary and so on the

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,689
thing that really drives my research

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,060
that motivates my research is this grand

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,810
vision this grand ambition of hot and

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,720
and also missing maps are to to map all

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,909
the all the areas in need we're

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,460
currently no maps are available which is

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,070
a formidable task its vast undertaking

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,659
and one way of expressing that is the

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,579
statement to reach our goal we need the

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,770
missing marks project to be the biggest

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:47,340
instance of digital volunteerism the

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:50,369
world has ever seen and and the the so

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,369
the question is how do you do that how

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,200
do you make that happen as you might

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,909
know the hot is already really

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,130
successful many people have contributed

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,680
how well does it actually work and also

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,119
crucially as we grow we need to meet

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,850
more and more concerned about the

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,710
experience of absolute newcomers people

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,610
with maybe no prior mapping experience

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,140
so how well are we doing in that respect

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,410
maybe first a bit of an overview of what

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,690
we've

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,700
in the past so does this here at the

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,830
bottom is a heat map of all the places

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,190
where people have been contributing

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,950
edits too hot and as you can see there's

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,370
this already a vast area but also people

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,320
who know who know the data know that we

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,330
at the moment we're only scratching the

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,740
surface of the kinds of information we

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,830
can gather and also the kinds of areas

00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,770
where we've worked but tens of thousands

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:44,310
of people have contributed to 148 our at

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,190
40,000 hours have been spent updating

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,210
them up and it's all in OpenStreetMap

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,030
this is another way of looking at the

00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:56,130
activity this is a timeline of major

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:58,080
initiatives so i looked at the the 2600

00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,880
projects on the tasking manager and

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,580
group them by by their particular

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,870
purpose and the region and so on and put

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,660
them on a timeline so here you can see

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,180
that pretty much every every month there

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,540
there's a bunch of new key initiatives

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,040
happening some of them are in response

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,110
to particular kinds of events some of

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,730
them are long-term initiatives that

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,030
maybe have a particular kind of mission

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,070
like missing maps where they are focused

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,580
on proactive mapping making maps before

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,080
there they are needed there's another

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:33,930
way of looking at the total activity

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:37,980
this a again a timeline and here every

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:40,440
every horizontal line is a is a hot

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,070
project at the top are projects that

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,590
were launched I'm sorry projects that

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,480
were launched a few years ago at the

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,110
bottom their projects are quite new here

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,790
and the the line goes up with the

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,770
proportional to the number of

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,590
contributors so you can you can kind of

00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,530
see as how activity moves over time so

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,900
the big spike here this is this Nepal

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:08,400
and as you might know is by far the

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,590
biggest the moment of the biggest crowd

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,380
joining hot that we've experienced by an

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,150
order of magnitude maybe two but then

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,959
you can also see is the other it does

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,090
like done here is Ecuador so if we if we

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,700
zoom in zoom in there stairs ecuador

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,080
here and generally you can see a lot of

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,010
the projects they tend to be most active

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,940
in the beginning then it fizzled out

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:34,960
some projects have an eternal life time

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,910
some projects have that moments in

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,830
between where the project maybe has

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,500
already been around two to three months

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:46,140
and then they're there there's a big

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:49,060
sort of rear resurgence and activity

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,310
let's have a look at some some I'm going

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,080
to speak in three parts I'm going to

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,000
have a quick look at the contributor

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,470
statistics I'm going to talk a bit a

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,630
little bit about the new camera

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,400
experiences and situations we've looked

00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,470
at and at the end I'm going to discuss

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,150
this question to what extent hodkin can

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:10,000
be characterized as an on-demand task

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:11,500
force so well when you look at the

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,900
people who've contributed too hot and

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,580
you see you look at what I have done

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,710
before with in with an open street map

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,290
it now turns out that eighty percent of

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,570
people who start contributing to how to

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:27,700
have no prior openstreetmap experience

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,620
which is a significant number and that

00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,300
number keeps going up I think when we

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,400
spoke when we looked at this number at

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,800
the hot summit last year it was a sixty

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,600
percent and so which a man hand means

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,760
hot is one of the ways in which the

00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,410
OpenStreetMap community is growing but

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,610
it also means that we need to be mindful

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:53,650
of that when we when we create workflows

00:05:47,610 --> 00:06:00,660
and so when they then join hot how long

00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:03,510
do they remain active the median a

00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,160
overall contribute and contribution time

00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,440
for for contributors is about one hour

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,970
is a little bit over an hour meaning

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,340
fifty percent of these tens of thousands

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,240
of people spend at least an hour

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,600
contributing to hot and then and then

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,180
they stop and do other things twenty

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,440
percent of all hot contributors work for

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,440
at least three hours and then they're

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,240
the top they they're very actively they

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,010
essentially don't stop so this is not in

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,530
a single session this is over the entire

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,540
period of their activity so let's put

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,640
this in context is a lot as a little I

00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,290
think if you if you see this from the

00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,570
context of a volunteer organization it

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,040
seems very small if you see it from the

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,180
context of other websites where people

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,509
maybe just received

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,979
random link maybe as a friend told ma

00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,759
maybe maybe they saw something in the

00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:50,680
news and then they spend an hour

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,060
producing work for us contributing to

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,889
the map I think that's that's

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:59,560
significant here is the is another

00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,449
timeline does the the daily number of

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,850
active contributors and then you see

00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,440
there are these spikes there's most like

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,780
here and there is massive spike here

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,400
then Ecuador is another one so they're

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,810
they're these generally there's always

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,919
activity but then there is these moments

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:20,169
where a lot of where a large crowd crowd

00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:22,180
appears and some of these these large

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,310
events they are also big growth events

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,280
for for the hot community this here is a

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,550
cumulative chart of the number of user

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,930
accounts of people have contributed to

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,690
touch and you can see particularly

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:38,430
during Nepal loads of people joined in a

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,430
very short time Ecuador very similar

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,750
however in these moments we also see

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,090
that those newcomers they come at these

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,280
key moments they don't stick around as

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,740
long this here is what's called a

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,050
surprise survival plot it's essentially

00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:56,139
a way of showing your attention over

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,909
time this is a zero is the moment when

00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:00,449
the person drawing and then there's

00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:03,789
there's the the time that has passed

00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:06,460
after they joined and then the lines

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:09,250
here they they draw the the likelihood

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:13,060
that the person will still be active the

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:15,340
dotted line here is the hot average the

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:19,120
the blue line over here is Ebola has

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:22,509
higher than average retention down here

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,810
three lines this this is Nepal is high

00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:27,310
on and this Ecuador loads of people join

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:32,620
during these events but they don't tend

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:34,390
to stick around at far as long and at

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,099
which I'm sure I'm sure has many reasons

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,050
and we can maybe discuss this also

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,950
during the curing a Q&A but I think a

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:43,659
one part is also for us it makes them

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,270
really makes it really important that we

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,910
provide guidance for when these

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,829
newcomers up here when one of the things

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,480
I did in the very beginning is looking

00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:53,110
at task complexity in the tasking

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,329
manager

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:59,260
task complexity as a number of aspects

00:08:55,329 --> 00:09:02,290
or the extent to which there there is

00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:06,550
context given so there there's a stated

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:08,500
motivation there is a specific list of

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,360
features that need to be lap dance on so

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,779
and I was trying to understand to what

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,880
extent do does the description of the

00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:18,010
task and the structure of a task have an

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:22,800
impact on on how long people stick

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:24,850
around and a generally we found that

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,740
tasks that are bred more complex for

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,470
example because I asked for 15 feet to

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,660
map as people to map 15 features people

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,760
drop out more quickly and as a result

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:37,450
within missing maps we be changed how we

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,920
how we structure our tasks however this

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:44,050
is very surface level other people have

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:46,839
done much more intricate and subtle work

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,550
on trying to understand mapper mapper

00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,529
behavior and also what forms of guidance

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,769
do you do we want to give so for example

00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:55,810
felony a'kla she looked at she compared

00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:58,750
map contributions of remote mappers and

00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:01,240
locals in Nepal to try and understand

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,130
what kind of things do remote remote

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,510
mappers get wrong for example because

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,040
they they're not familiar with a

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,980
particular kind of architecture or so

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,880
and then trying to provide visual

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:16,540
examples so people know how to interpret

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:19,779
imagery another thing that is very

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,720
important in hot is the mapathon severe

00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:24,490
organizing it is there's a an innovation

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,709
that came out of openstreetmap with with

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:32,110
mapping parties however hot can i

00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:34,149
perfected this and in London we we do a

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,510
lot of those we have monthly my persona

00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:38,860
thorns and then my parents for for

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,199
particular kinds of events and so on and

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,800
there ok actually can ask who here has

00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:48,279
attended a mapathon this is almost half

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,860
very nice so for those who of you who

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,990
haven't um is there their social

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,360
settings typically on an evening where

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,130
people come together for 23 hours you

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,110
get an introduction to to the mapping

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,730
practice sometimes there are someone who

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,190
who tells stories about the field about

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,380
the kind of impact of the work

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,149
but generally it's a way to it's a

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,350
setting to to produce maps and kind of

00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,760
be social and I think that's very

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:13,089
important having these kinds of settings

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,910
is very important to to introduce people

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,990
to to the community and the practice but

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:21,790
also give them a place where they can

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:24,430
ask questions so we went one of the

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,470
things we did is we at this point we

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,810
have organized dozens of mapathon in

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,269
London and we're looking at we were

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,920
starting to give a change to understand

00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,510
how can we evaluate the activity and

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,180
specifically how can we try and

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:40,120
understand what things to organisers

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,370
need to pay attention to I won't go into

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,699
all the details but essentially we made

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,579
these trace plots of a perform activity

00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:50,050
and then create sessions where we

00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:52,510
reviewed them and discuss what happened

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:56,949
so here for example there's at the top

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:59,889
of the mapathon in in march 2015 at the

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:03,130
bottom is one in august every line here

00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:05,199
is the activity of a contributor and

00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,480
then you you see that different mapathon

00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:09,310
have very different activity profiles at

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,260
the top it's it's kind of the fizzled

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,390
and lots of people stopped early whereas

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,570
here people start and stop pretty much

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:19,029
at the same time and and the issue here

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,190
at the top that might people stop their

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:24,310
activity is that there were Wi-Fi issues

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,930
at the wind you and in fact the Wi-Fi it

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,120
tends to be at larger map of phones

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:31,690
tends to be one of the first things that

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:35,410
breaks yeah we our mapathon have 30 40

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:39,010
sometimes 100 people very few venues are

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,839
prepared for groups of that size and

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:44,740
then all kinds of other things can go

00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:46,779
wrong and everyone when we look at the

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,819
retention of map authorities I'm

00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:51,760
surprised how well it works people keep

00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:56,800
coming back so again it's a global

00:12:51,760 --> 00:13:00,040
average this is the the retention of our

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,889
of our monthly mapathon attendees and

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,209
then compared to the here here is a

00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,860
group of people who work on the same

00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:08,990
projects as

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,030
the projects we do at our mapathon but

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,550
they didn't attend our mapathon so we

00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:17,290
call them the online group and their

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:21,380
their pretensions also not not as good

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,430
I'm going to skip a few of those however

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,140
I think we we still don't quite

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,820
understand what it is that that keeps

00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,290
people engaged at these kinds of

00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,660
marathons and I think there is there

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,730
certainly an opportunity to do some

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:35,000
ethnographic studies we have a lot of

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:38,660
stories that people tell us someone told

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,220
me this is one one place in my life that

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,200
is about community it's not my family

00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,600
it's not my work this is about sort of

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,160
together in s doing something together a

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,610
surprising number of people tell us that

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,730
they have prior GIS experiences so

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,050
generally my sense is that a lot of the

00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,170
thing that makes these kinds of settings

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,600
work is that many people are already

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,490
prepared to be active as it's not a

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,560
question of converting them it's a

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:07,190
question of activating them of showing

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:10,190
them that they can they can make a

00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,150
contribution and I think one of the most

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,590
important things we learned is that

00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:16,580
people want to know that their work has

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:19,100
an impact we we started at some point we

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,750
were able to tell stories Pete's and

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,200
others were able to tell stories from

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,880
the field with with photos with stories

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,250
sometimes with speakers who have been in

00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,450
the field coming to to mapathon store to

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,950
talk about the work and I think that

00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,020
really has an impact on people's

00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:38,330
attitudes about about what it is that

00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:39,830
they do when when I think about hot for

00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,710
the longest time I thought of it kind of

00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,970
also as an on-demand task force the dis

00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,860
notion that there a natural disaster

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,520
happens and then the community comes

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:53,030
together sort of Springs to action and

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:55,570
and and creates the maps on demand and

00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:58,460
when we look at the contribution history

00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:01,000
we certainly see indicators of that so

00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:04,280
here's a here's a trace plot every

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,250
horizontal line is a contributor every

00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,150
dot is when is when when they contribute

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,040
to the map and then there are these

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:13,480
moments like here where suddenly loads

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,480
of contributors sprang into action

00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,920
here's another timeline which shows a

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,970
different kind of behavior pattern

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,510
unfortunately at the on the projection

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,210
it

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,710
it's not quite visible but essentially

00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:27,650
what we see here is like a handover

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,900
pattern the the Reds so this is an

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:33,920
alluvial flow chart where every month

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,050
you have a column and then you have

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,950
different kinds of initiatives

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,530
horizontally so here the blue ones

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,780
that's missing maps activity grain is

00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,700
Nepal and here the red one that's

00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,590
cyclone Pam which happened just before

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,070
any power so what we see is that a lot

00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:51,800
of people who contributed to cyclone Pam

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:53,330
joins the Nepali effort and then a lot

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,430
of missing Maps contributor as well and

00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,050
then Nepal was kind of over and then

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,050
there was a summer slump just after

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,180
Nepal where there was no other kind of

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:05,240
major activity and then a lot of people

00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,640
joined missing lapse efforts so there's

00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,280
another kind of pattern that we see so I

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,830
was trying to understand so what is it

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,740
that really happens during events who

00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:18,110
contributes when Nepal happens who is it

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,960
that Springs to action so I took the the

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,960
timeline and I classified into into kind

00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,850
of events type initiatives and mission

00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,570
type initiatives that's that are more

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:31,220
long term and here we see the the

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,250
distribution of contributors across

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,140
these two timelines and they're there i

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,330
categorize it into three groups at the

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,790
bottom there are newcomers in the middle

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,500
are what I call the reactivated people

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,810
these are people who hadn't contributed

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,790
for two months but then join for this

00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,680
particular kind of initiative and then

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,480
at the at the top these are people

00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,230
who've been mapping anyway they were

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,150
just active in the days and weeks before

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,490
so here for events and here for mission

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,440
based so missing maps and so on and we

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,640
see a number of things in there and I

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,710
was a little bit surprised by that the

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,930
first that I was surprised by is during

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,640
the disaster events the proportion of

00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,640
people who are reactivated is

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:16,790
surprisingly low most of the people were

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:18,410
already active anyway arm the and then

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:22,220
there there's a sizable proportion of

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:24,199
people of newcomers of new people this

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,730
the second thing is that there's that

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,030
seemed to be the sort of two classes of

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:31,790
events on one hand these high-profile

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:33,220
events like Nepal and high on the which

00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,070
attract a large amount of new

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,860
covers and then kind of everything else

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,870
smaller disaster events and the third

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,340
that you found is that a lot of the

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,230
recruiting actually happens in the in

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:50,350
the more sustained initiatives with the

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:52,480
exception of high-profile events so so

00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:55,090
what does that mean how does that affect

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,520
for example what is the impact on the

00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,100
map as a result of that it turns out

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,559
that a lot of the contributors who join

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,240
during hope high-profile disaster events

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,480
where we already know they're not going

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,900
to stick around for very long there and

00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,809
it probably it's quite likely that also

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,980
the they have an impact on the

00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:20,250
contribution quality here is a their

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,860
their box plots which showed the

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,720
percentage of work that people

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,549
contribute that is going to be deleted

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,929
eventually and again I'm trying to get

00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:33,370
for these three groups newcomers

00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:35,770
previously people who have been

00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,690
reactivated people open already active

00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,850
anyway and I'm distinguishing between

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,010
their contributions during events and

00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,570
during mission based initiatives during

00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,960
all the groups they're kind of the same

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,700
but there is this big exception here

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,330
people who join during the PAL during

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,700
high on they don't tend to stick around

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,220
as long and their contribution quality

00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,990
is slightly worse than for others and I

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,770
think these things they they have a few

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:04,510
they have a few implications and I think

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:09,789
one thing that where there's an

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:12,159
opportunity to to for a bit of care is

00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:15,490
when big disaster happens is to be

00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,320
prepared to to give those newcomers a

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,390
little bit of guidance and I think the

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,030
challenge is a lot of them may be coming

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,950
from because they they saw something on

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,940
the news or because someone sent a

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,679
milling and they aren't necessarily

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,690
connected to the community so I think

00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:33,190
there's a question here when these

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:35,799
people arrive where should be where

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,840
should we are nudge them to contribute

00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,909
what kind of contributions should we ask

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,350
them to do and also being mindful that

00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:43,070
they what might not have a lot of time

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,769
to improve their

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,210
their understanding of the process the

00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,159
second thing I think that we learned is

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:56,090
at the moment I don't think there is a

00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:59,210
good reactivation mechanism I'm yeah I

00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:01,909
think my time is up but but essentially

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:04,730
are when a minute when a minor disaster

00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:08,389
happens or not it not as big disaster a

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:10,490
Cessna Palin high on and so on how do

00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:12,230
people find out you kinda you need to

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,990
follow the daily chapter you need to be

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:18,740
on the mailing list follow social media

00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:22,789
and so on and and while a large number

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:25,970
of people do that I think that works for

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:28,250
the kind of the top 1000 like the core

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,049
community but what about the other tens

00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,029
of thousands who have also already

00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,769
computed contributors who have already

00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:35,120
made some prior experiences how do we

00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:38,559
tell them how do we stay in touch with

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,559
them that that their help is needed

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,559
thank

00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,960
yeah you were you said that twenty

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:10,600
percent provide three hours or more five

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,850
percent 18 + hours this or any

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,640
relationship between feedback that

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,620
they're given we more likely to see

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:22,390
people that are given positive feedback

00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:24,070
to retain and also do we involuntarily

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,670
get rid of people when we start in

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:30,190
validating their work I would love to

00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:34,900
look at that question unfortunately it's

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:37,390
very hard to to analyze validation first

00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,490
of all the the the exchange between

00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:42,910
validator and mapper is not made public

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,860
so I I can't as an outsider I can't I

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,360
can see these kinds of interactions now

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,040
so there are privacy implications with

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,740
sharing these kinds of interactions but

00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,290
in principle there is data there the

00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:58,030
other thing is that validation is is not

00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,990
as it is a practice now is not its kind

00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,510
of situational and they're very

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,840
different ways of validating so we I

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:06,430
think generally it's also very hard to

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,320
to interpret what exactly it is that

00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,120
that happens I think this is a very

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:17,080
important question and I think this a

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:21,220
lot a lot of the the the newcomer

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,540
experience the the kind of the feeling

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,370
that people have when they interact with

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,930
hot is going to be about these kinds of

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,490
exchanges about feeling that they're

00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:29,530
they're speaking to a community of

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,690
individuals and they can have

00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,220
conversations someone actually looks at

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,170
their work and gives them a compliment

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,900
and so on I think these things are super

00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,760
important at the moment we'd be I don't

00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,460
have stats I would love to do it but I

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,210
but I also yeah I think getting the data

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:48,330
is is a bit harder this is a very good

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,330
question

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,290
hi martin and give you looked it

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,570
obviously through missing maps and hot

00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:04,850
there's lots of new people coming to osm

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,240
have you looked at how many of those

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:10,210
people actually make none hot edits

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,610
after coming after that entry point

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,840
fairly enough the answer is no for the

00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,610
funny left that that was the question I

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,400
started with and there's that there was

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:22,760
like the first thing that drove me and

00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,380
then I found that quite quickly it's not

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,540
that easy to distinguish between hot

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,110
edits and openstreetmap edits for a

00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:36,679
number of reasons I think I know how to

00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:43,990
do this now but I've not done it yet no

00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:43,990
