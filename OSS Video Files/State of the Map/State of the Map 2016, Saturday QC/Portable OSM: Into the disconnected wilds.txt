Title: Portable OSM: Into the disconnected wilds
Publication date: 2016-10-18

OpenStreetMap’s offline tools are amazing. But for intensive mapping by small teams, coordinating contributions can be difficult; especially when you lack reliable internet connectivity! Because the Red Cross’ mapping locations are so remote, a better way to interact and edit OSM in a disconnected way for days and potentially weeks at a time was required.

Portable OSM combines an offline OSM API, Field Papers, OpenMapKit, a captive portal, and many new enhancements to the OSM workflow. Using very cheap hardware (under $300), contributors are able to download an area of interest, work offline in the field (editing with familiar tools), and then return to a connected environment and sync all changes back to OpenStreetMap.

This session will take you through the design and architecture process, experiences of using Portable OSM in real world conditions and show you how to set up your own instance.

okay our next speakers are from the

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:10,760
American Red Cross if I'm not mistaken

00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:10,760
yes Emily ss please welcome our speakers

00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:19,320
so you're actually getting two speakers

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,689
for the price of one set from stamen who

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,430
actually developed possum forests joined

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,590
state of the map at the last minute so

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,039
we're gonna pull them in to add a little

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,349
bit of his perspective as well so possum

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,750
portable OpenStreetMap I'll talk a

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,550
little bit about why we the American Red

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,430
Cross needed to develop this as a tool

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,960
and the environments where we use it

00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,600
we'll talk about our philosophy for the

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,200
design how it works and where we're

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,250
going from here so I think a lot of

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,750
people in this room are probably

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,480
familiar with the missing maps project

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,309
but just in case this is a program that

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,350
started two years ago as a collaboration

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,680
between the American Red Cross the

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,449
British Red Cross hot an MSF UK there's

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,090
since been a number of organizations

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,339
that have joined since but a lot of us

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,010
were working on GIS or mapping in

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,729
disaster response contexts and we found

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,060
that doing hot activations and mapping

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,939
for response is fantastic but we need

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,619
maps before a disaster hits in

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,640
OpenStreetMap a lot of the places where

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,740
we're working a lot of the most

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,780
vulnerable communities still aren't

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,700
really very well mapped so we started

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,640
this project with the goal of mapping 20

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,130
million people by 2017 and we do this in

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,009
two steps firstly we host mapathon x'

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,170
and we engage with digital volunteers to

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,079
help them trace satellite imagery into

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:45,000
OpenStreetMap secondly we work with our

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,380
local organizations Red Cross MSF etc to

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,450
help community volunteers who are

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,189
actually on the ground in the field to

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,479
learn about why mapping is important and

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,040
help them figure out what in their

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,470
community is a priority to put in the

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,869
map we bring technology we train them

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,630
and we help them get started and thirdly

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,310
once the base mapping is done we work on

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,570
developing maps and analysis and other

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,340
things like that and helping them

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,520
understand how they can incorporate this

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,209
to plan resilience activities or conduct

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,209
other programs

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,800
so in the past two years we've actually

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,560
surpassed our goal of twenty million

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,959
people with the help of twelve thousand

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,780
digital volunteers this involved over

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,280
300 mapathon x' this is looking at total

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,080
for missing matt's not just American Red

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,390
Cross and we've been doing this all

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,100
around the world I think a lot of people

00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,780
are very familiar with the remote work

00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,030
that we've been doing but people might

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,880
be less familiar with all the field work

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,890
that goes into this so even before the

00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,630
missing Maps project the American Red

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,440
Cross has been using field papers and

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,940
GPS devices to do base mapping to do to

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,489
put where our projects are located

00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,580
actually on the map this is fantastic

00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:55,280
but there's a lot of time required to

00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,709
get data from field papers back into OSM

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,200
and we found that it's not always the

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,840
best tool for the job if we're looking

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,519
to survey every building in an area and

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,709
look to answer the same four questions

00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,630
of what's the building condition what's

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,160
the material or something like that it's

00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,080
it's more difficult to get consistent

00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,150
answers and we spent a lot of time

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,950
trying to clean up data for Spelling's

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,280
trying to match key value pairs so that

00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,380
they're going into osm accurately so

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,560
about a year year and a half ago we

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,000
developed open map kit with spatial dev

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,579
we wanted to take the functionality of

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,549
ODK and the ability to have consistent

00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:35,959
surveys but add in a way to easily tag

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:39,650
this into osm so it looks like it's a

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,239
basic Android app you go through ODK but

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,340
there'll be a launch open map kit

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,370
component where it shows your GPS

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,660
location and the buildings around you

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,070
and then you can simply tap on a

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,040
building and then swipe through the

00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:55,370
forum building equals residential etc

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,070
and go through so this launched about a

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,859
year and a half ago we used it in Dhaka

00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,510
Bangladesh Tanzania Rwanda Ecuador

00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:04,820
Colombia and a variety of other places

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,280
and it's worked really well for us in

00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,950
general this is available on the Android

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,660
or the Google the Google Play Store

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,299
there's also full documentation

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,060
available on the website open map kit

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:19,160
org so it's really easy to set up and

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,130
use on your own I know there's a lot of

00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,570
osm editing tools out there at the time

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,389
when we were working on this we felt

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:31,790
like none of them really meet our knee

00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:33,530
so we developed it for our purposes we

00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,780
felt pretty comfortable about our tech

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,449
stack so a year ago we wanted to focus

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,949
on scaling up in a big way and doing a

00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:42,800
lot more community engagement in the

00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:45,919
field so we were awarded a grant to map

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,870
all the villages within 15 kilometers of

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,820
the borders between Guinea Liberia and

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,460
Sierra Leone this was an effort to

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,290
update the map for the border regions of

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,960
the areas where that were affected by

00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,840
Ebola it was really difficult to get a

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,610
basic map of where villages were in the

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,130
Ebola outbreak and it's very hard to do

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,010
contact tracing without that so we

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,460
wanted to go in update osm and get some

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:13,639
better field data this was a massive

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,020
project we found out eventually once

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,450
we've done the project we learned there

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,010
were 6,000 villages and communities that

00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,970
we'd gone to initially we thought there

00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,889
was maybe between 3 and 5 it's an area

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,720
roughly the size of Switzerland and we

00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,380
had four months to do this using about a

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,400
hundred volunteers on motorbikes

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,750
once we started this project we had to

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,370
kind of take a step back and think about

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,910
okay these are the tools we're currently

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,340
using these are their use cases is this

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,539
appropriate and if not how are we going

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,360
to build this out to work with this

00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:46,700
environment it's an incredibly difficult

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,180
region to be mapping in this is a good

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,720
Road

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,700
believe it or not and that's wet season

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,500
this is dry season this is one of our

00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,139
volunteers in the field this is the

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,150
bridge that he's crossing so it's

00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,400
incredibly difficult to move across this

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,139
area most of the region and the border

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,870
areas doesn't have cell phone

00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,430
connectivity and our volunteers were

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,320
often out there for days or even weeks

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:14,570
at a time where we wouldn't able be able

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:17,180
to physically get to them what we found

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,160
is that humanitarians are making

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,840
increasing use of mobile data collection

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,880
and cloud-based tools and that's

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,340
fantastic but we're also using them in

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,220
increasingly remote areas and sometimes

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,530
that can be a problem open map kit works

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,750
really well or all these tools work

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,909
really well until they don't and if we

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,479
need the internet to make a form to make

00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:40,180
a field papers atlas to upload data to

00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,559
all of those things suddenly if the

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,559
power goes down and we don't have

00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:47,969
internet there's nothing we can do or

00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:51,189
there's a fire but the conference Wi-Fi

00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:53,110
it happens here at home this is a photo

00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,419
from Rwanda where we were planning to

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,309
use open map kit and then the Nepal

00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:59,139
earthquake happened we weren't able to

00:06:57,309 --> 00:07:00,460
generate and be tiles or maybe we were

00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,469
just having our own technical problems

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,479
and we ended up having to stay up all

00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:06,490
night long and tape field papers

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,729
together by headlamp because we weren't

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,110
able to get open map get up and running

00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,939
so we have backup solutions and that's

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,409
great but for an area like West Africa

00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:19,479
we wanted to be able to actually change

00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:21,759
things on the fly so this is possum

00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:27,699
it runs on about a $300 piece of

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:29,830
hardware that's an Intel look so this is

00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:33,189
this is one of them here and it's

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,080
actually plugged in and broadcasting an

00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,719
access point called possum the password

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,969
is awesome possum and it's on a future

00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:43,389
slide you guys can connect to it and you

00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:44,860
can get the the dashboard and browser on

00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,889
philpapers you could make some field

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,449
papers of the University area if you

00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:51,639
want and you have open map get installed

00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:54,520
you could do some survey you can also do

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,779
some OpenStreetMap editing and because

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,069
we don't have any wireless here and

00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:59,620
that's broadcasting and it's not

00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:01,870
connected to the land it's completely

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,969
disconnected so we wanted something

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,759
where we could run as much of the

00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:08,999
OpenStreetMap stack as possible in a

00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:12,069
field situation and to be able to do it

00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:14,139
on hardware like this that we have

00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,149
control over not necessarily a rack

00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:18,310
server the other advantage of this is

00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:20,649
that you can run it off a car or if you

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:24,279
need to which is pretty powerful so

00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:26,680
here's a picture of Dale in Liberia

00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,149
that's the Red Cross chapter headquarter

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,580
or one of the chapter headquarters in

00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:32,310
the background and it's running off one

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,930
of the Land Cruisers that's there and

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:37,209
he's sitting there making some edits and

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,589
looking at the map and validating some

00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:40,180
data and there's no cell coverage

00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:43,719
there's no internet there's nothing like

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:46,600
that so the the basic gist of this is

00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,250
that we use a whole bunch of existing or

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,500
some tools that are out there

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,570
and it's it would be completely

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,910
impossible to have done without all of

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,320
you in the room and anybody watching at

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,810
home and anybody you've talked to you

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,790
that's developed any of those stuff it's

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,590
it's completely building on the

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,780
shoulders of giants it's it's kind of

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:07,030
amazing I feel like we're to digress

00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,920
slightly I feel like osm is an interest

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,330
in an interesting place where we're

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,640
starting to see third order effects

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,080
where there's the API there are the

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,180
tools that have been built on the API

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,070
and there have been all of these really

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,630
interesting things made and it's now

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:24,190
possible to combine them in novel ways

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:26,170
to affect change in West Africa and to

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,030
solve problems that you didn't really

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,710
know that could be solved by technology

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,030
before and you can do it because there

00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,730
are all of these different pieces that

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:35,920
get tied together so if the core will be

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,230
pulled data from overpass so we pull

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,940
data from OpenStreetMap and then we use

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:45,460
overpass to pull it into the OSM with

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,800
the OSM export tool that hot uses we've

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,200
got an adapted version of that and that

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,420
creates a little data packet that you

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,700
can load onto a USB stick I did that at

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,580
the hotel last night this has all of

00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,740
Brussels on it and because I didn't see

00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,830
any network Jack's here I brought it on

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,620
a USB stick loaded it on and it's and we

00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:08,050
actually did this at one point where we

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,589
had a USB stick that needed to be

00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,660
prepared

00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:12,400
digitally transferred to London and then

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,650
somebody got on a plane and ended up in

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,060
Guinea a couple days later and loaded it

00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,940
on one of these devices so we're really

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:22,150
thinking about data as a logistics

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,220
problem and data as its is really going

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,730
back to sneak or not and packet networks

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,500
in the form of eighteenth-century ships

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,980
so it's it's really interesting to look

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,600
at data in that way and all of the OSM

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,940
tools are really great for pulling data

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,380
downstream you can create all sorts of

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,000
derivative artifacts you can create

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,120
things like map tiles you can create

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,280
surveys but if the data can't actually

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,070
get back upstream if it can't get merged

00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,200
into OpenStreetMap it's it's it's really

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:54,490
not any better than having all of these

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,770
disparate data bases that that

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,990
OpenStreetMap is trying to replace so

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,520
one of the other initial goals was to be

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,589
able to get all of that data back

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,710
to do that I'm trying to member what we

00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:10,500
have slide was so to do that you can

00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,060
make these edits offline so it pulls an

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,710
extract so in this case we've got

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,140
Brussels on here you can make changes to

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,660
Brussels and all of those local change

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,810
sets occur using exactly the same

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,490
software as OpenStreetMap org and

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:26,910
they're diverging from edits that are

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,770
happening on the Internet at large and

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,140
then when when the Red Cross team

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,660
returns from a field deployment actually

00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,820
what do we have for oh yeah so you can

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,400
edit an ID or Johnson sorry I'm kind of

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:42,870
diverging from the slides a little bit

00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:44,550
you didn't see that yet so once all

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,110
those edits have been made we take we

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,720
package up all of the change sets there

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,940
and we replay them against the main osm

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,620
and we make sure that anything that

00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,450
conflicts with changes that happened

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,370
elsewhere for Brussels that would be a

00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,440
problem for West Africa it turns out

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,510
it's not there aren't a whole lot of

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,250
active mappers particularly in the

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,650
villages that they're operating in which

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,540
is why they're operating in them so it

00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,430
is possible to run into conflict but the

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,430
number of conflicts that occur are a lot

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,890
smaller so there's a really kind of

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,540
convoluted workflow that I'm really

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,940
proud of because it works I'm not proud

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,290
of it because it's pretty that I'm not

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,300
going to talk about I can talk to you

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,100
guys about it a little bit more in

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,540
person and we're also gonna do it birds

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,830
of a feather session at 4:00 this

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,959
afternoon I can't remember which room

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,810
that come look for us we'll have one of

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:34,050
these up again and you can play with

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:38,070
open map kit and open data kit and do

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:39,209
some edits there yeah so right so

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,550
eventually those changes get

00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:43,709
synchronized back up and you can go back

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,440
out into the field with another set of

00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:49,380
changes and we did this I was in Ecuador

00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,089
with the Red Cross back in March and we

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,700
took an extract of the area that we were

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:55,500
working in and then went down there and

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,600
then came back and then I needed to

00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,520
write the software so overall it was

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,260
probably like a month and a half that we

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,709
were disconnected from the main OSM and

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:08,100
within that we I think had 350 change

00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:10,500
sets made by about 35 volunteers and I

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,940
think touched about 15,000 objects and

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,290
didn't run into a whole lot of merge

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,100
conflicts so I only made two mistakes

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,870
when I merged

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,449
back in so it's pretty happy with that

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,790
and they were easy enough to fix

00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:22,589
going through and like okay the bounding

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,240
box for this edit is completely wrong I

00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:28,380
guess one of the nodes we didn't manage

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,519
to renumber properly oh so yeah that's

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,790
that's the other thing that we talked

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,500
about

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:34,980
possum being really good for uncertain

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,870
environments and the West Africa and the

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,149
rainy season is an uncertain environment

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,949
turns out the free university of

00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:42,839
brussels is in it is an uncertain

00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:45,870
environment when there's a fire in a in

00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,880
a server cabinet and if you've ever

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,170
experienced bad hotel Wi-Fi it's the

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,620
same thing and if you've ever tried to

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:55,620
do a workshop using bad hotel Wi-Fi it's

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:58,680
really painful so we're discovering that

00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,670
possum isn't about OpenStreetMap and it

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,740
isn't even really about the

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,600
synchronization it's about thinking

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,120
about something where I have two of

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,250
these riding around in my bag with me

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,399
that can run all sorts of different

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,600
software and can be repurposed for all

00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,220
sorts of different things they could

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,930
provide Wikipedia they could provide

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:21,360
material for a workshop so that you

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,759
don't have to rely on really bad really

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,800
bad internet and have really positive

00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,509
experiences if you're doing an edit

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,110
Athan in a place that has really bad

00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:33,120
wireless you can have people work really

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,500
quickly against the local API and then

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,490
synchronize it when you're done or you

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,279
could do that for other types of

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,889
workshops starting to ramble here what

00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:42,120
else should we talk about so just kind

00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:45,089
of stepping back a little bit so

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,470
basically the process is one of these

00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,839
gets ordered you order one of these

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,220
online it shows up you have to assemble

00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,079
some components if you have trouble with

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,779
that seth has offered to do this for you

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,060
in exchange for baked goods but

00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:59,189
basically we kind of we do and install

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,810
the first time boot it up and then every

00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:03,990
time from that point forward you just

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,970
plug this into you do a hot export take

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,939
your area load it onto the possum and

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,470
you're basically you're good to go so we

00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:12,810
do our full stack of Red Cross

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,339
operations on this we have a mapping hub

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,339
in Guinea that acts as our base of

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:19,319
operations for West Africa it actually

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,790
doesn't have internet it was going to

00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,470
cost something like forty thousand

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,149
dollars for three months of internet so

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,499
we said no thank you

00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:29,379
and we run mapathon off of this we do

00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:36,059
all of our fields work off of it so it's

00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:38,739
been fantastic speaks for itself

00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,539
this tool is continually learning and

00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:42,249
growing it's essentially a possum is

00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:45,489
essentially glue that ties together a

00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:47,169
stack of other software I learned

00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:49,839
recently that a possum and an opossum

00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:51,939
are two entirely different animals we're

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,559
also kind of actively trying to figure

00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:57,809
out well where do we go from here

00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:57,809
so stuff came down to Ecuador

00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:01,989
it was Ecuador to try to take a look at

00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:04,449
what does this look like in the fields

00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:06,549
from a developer perspective because if

00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:08,559
we're developing software that works for

00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,299
local community uses we want to make

00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,069
sure that the developers actually get a

00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:13,419
chance to see what that looks like so

00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:14,889
the way we don't have a disconnect

00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:16,299
between where the software is being

00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:21,549
developed and where it's actually being

00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:22,989
used if you guys have ever experienced

00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:24,759
problems with field papers when you're

00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:27,699
trying to use it on the field you can

00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:31,629
blame me for those but I'm gonna kind of

00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:33,669
I'm gonna say I didn't know because I'm

00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:35,409
not one of those people that's actively

00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,789
using in the field so understanding how

00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:39,639
people are using it in the field is

00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:41,709
incredibly valuable and if they're any

00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,389
tool developers out there go out there

00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,099
watch your users find out how they're

00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:47,589
doing it find out what breaks find out

00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:50,169
what they're not telling you it's kind

00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,970
of amazing other directions that were

00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:53,499
growing in we're actually integrating

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,809
literally as we speak we're working on

00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:58,119
integrating open drone map so that we'll

00:16:55,809 --> 00:17:01,269
also be able to collect imagery process

00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:04,059
that do our edits off of that so that'll

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:05,860
be coming out in the upcoming weeks in

00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,799
terms of how you can get this this is

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,699
documented on github at the moment and

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,490
then we're building out more

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,019
user-friendly documentation from here

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:16,509
West Africa as a project has been a

00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:17,769
complete sprint from start to finish so

00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:18,939
we're just getting to the point where

00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:20,799
the fieldwork is done and we have a

00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,409
chance to think about how do we kind of

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,019
think about making our tools more easily

00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:28,449
available publicly so that's coming soon

00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:30,690
she said she said drones so you can

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:36,240
actually bring a drone in a Pelican case

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:38,010
to wherever fly it process it

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,570
take one of these guys and you've got

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,920
imagery that you can trace in the field

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:45,750
without ever having been connected to

00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:48,390
the Internet it's pretty awesome so

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,679
we're very excited about this and then

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,080
again just kind of going back to the

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,580
point we're super excited about possum

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,309
as a tool but we also want to think

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,780
about why we developed it so we're

00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,700
continuing to get engaged with the

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,380
community and think about well what are

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,840
their needs what does this look like how

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,330
do we make editing OSM more possible and

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,920
more feasible for people who maybe don't

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,510
have consistent Wi-Fi or don't have

00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:15,090
consistent electricity and stuff like

00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:16,170
that yeah before I just remembered a

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,170
couple things that I would say about

00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:21,929
open map kit so the tie-in to the

00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,340
previous and building editor talk one of

00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:26,570
the things that's really important for

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,010
the disaster disaster risk reduction

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,780
efforts in the humanitarian world is

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,010
knowing what buildings are made out of

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,170
how large they are

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,480
what and what quality they're in so

00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,179
being able to see other ways of getting

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,740
that data in is incredibly helpful

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:42,870
that's one of the things that open map

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,400
kit was originally built for to be able

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,910
to do surveys to be able to do it really

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,150
quickly

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,500
not to map new things necessarily so as

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,140
we were talking about this we're like oh

00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,480
is open map kit really only good for

00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,830
field situations for humanitarians and I

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,660
don't think it is I think it's also

00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,880
really good for areas that have been

00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,890
extremely well mapped but some parts of

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,679
those those areas have not been touched

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,420
in maybe a year or so so if you're

00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,010
looking to get involved in this and you

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,660
want to experience this for yourself I

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,290
would highly encourage you to give it a

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:16,440
shot and to create a forum and to to

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,610
resurvey areas like downtown areas and

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,160
smaller towns that you haven't visited

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,470
in a while and you can do that really

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,970
quickly by pre loading the data in and

00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,010
what you're essentially doing is your

00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,720
ground truth in your own data but now

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:30,030
that it's been a year later two years

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,980
later things have changed and you can

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,780
just flip through and only make the

00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,240
changes that are there so I think that

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:39,390
open map kit is a really valuable tool

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,870
for for the particularly of the dense

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:46,230
osm communities as well as the as well

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,610
as the developing world I think that's

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,030
all we had so if they

00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,030
questions

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:06,820
I thank you for the talk I'm sorry I'm

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:10,280
gonna be a bit critical but that's me

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,960
I'm happy to actually to see that in the

00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:15,530
postal project you went from an Asian

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,490
initial bout of rampant not invented

00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:21,770
here to actually using the normal

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,570
OpenStreetMap stack where did we start

00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:27,230
with the non invented here part the note

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:28,340
said j/s implementation of the API and

00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,860
all that kind of stuff which was

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,770
initially planned oh I'm looking for

00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:36,500
we're looking for lightweight solutions

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:39,140
yeah but you know I can understand that

00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,510
but there was no real communication with

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,750
the developer community talking about

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,400
communities in osm and just the same

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,100
without map like you said you weren't

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,010
happy with what was available but there

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:57,020
was no communication into the developer

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:59,350
community of ours em and I continue to

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,640
feel that this is the whole thing that

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,130
you're building on these pieces but

00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,930
you're not actually asking people for

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,420
their opinions on how things should work

00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:11,360
for example the synchronization back

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:14,210
into OS m there are multiple ways to

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,420
doing it using github conflict

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:21,830
resolution to synchronize stuff back

00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:24,500
into OS m is just awful hack in my works

00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:26,480
though it worked I believe that for a

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,510
hundred conflicts not for ten thousand

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,710
well that's we're not trying to end up

00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,240
in situations where we end up in two

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,770
thousand I think that your criticism

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,320
about not engaging the developer

00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,810
communities is actually right on and I

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,810
would not necessarily defend but I would

00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:44,090
I would submit that one of the reasons

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:47,600
for that is if you talk to Emily her

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,310
last what you're you're you're eight

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,640
months something like that has been an

00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:54,590
absolute whirlwind and the humanitarian

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,990
communities often have very specific

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,090
needs that they need to address and they

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,880
also know what their needs are very well

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:06,230
so these tools were built first and

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,700
foremost for the Red Cross and we wanted

00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,710
to use everything that we had at hand

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,770
and we wanted to be able to do it in as

00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,390
we wanted

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,650
be able to reuse as much as possible and

00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:17,850
we also wanted to do it in a sustainable

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:20,970
way but our our primary users for this

00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,500
or it's well it's not the traditional

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,300
historical or some community it's the

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,040
emerging osm community it's the people

00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,070
that miss the missing map suffered is

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:32,460
bringing into the project and as a

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:35,130
result we are overly focused on their

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,380
needs but that's because that's where

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:51,180
the the Red Cross efforts are currently

00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:52,650
focused hi there my name is Andy and I'm

00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,960
one of the developers of the core

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,190
OpenStreetMap website software and I

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,190
also work for the OpenStreetMap

00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:01,230
foundation operations working group what

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,680
could we change that would make your

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,240
life easier with puzzle I think the

00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,860
first thing is a pull request that's

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,950
sitting out there which is to docker

00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:14,100
eyes it for the most part um it's worked

00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,850
as is I haven't had some I've had to

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,410
make make very strategic changes to

00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:22,070
bypass the user authentication because

00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:24,210
we don't have any way to verify identity

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:27,660
but everything will not be something

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:29,760
that you would be helpful for things so

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,280
I think that it's such a niche need at

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,140
the moment I mean we do want to add

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,270
Emmett we do want to solve the identity

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,610
problem at some point where we can

00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,860
actually get the authorship from people

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,780
in the field and using their osm

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,130
accounts it's that's a really really

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,710
really hard problem especially when you

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,180
can't have person internet and password

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,470
in the same or person internet and

00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,480
device being authorized in the same

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:56,640
place but I think there are probably

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:58,770
some clever solutions around that no I

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,360
mean I it's it's been really it's been

00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,850
really great to work with

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,710
yeah and I've I think I've got a few

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,100
changes that now that things are calming

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,320
down

00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,790
that I'd like to submit back that are

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,030
things that I had to do kind of in the

00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:13,770
last throes of getting it ready but no I

00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,680
mean it's it's actually gonna it's been

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:18,900
a wonderful project to work on and yeah

00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,560
everything is worked more or less as

00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,560
we've expected

00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,860
okay maybe a little bit technical

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,779
question can you cover in a couple of

00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,289
words how do you actually synchronize it

00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:44,090
back Simon already knows but resolve

00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:45,769
these conflicts and everything sure

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,870
so there's a there's a more detailed

00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:50,659
blog post that talks through the process

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:53,120
on hi dot stamen calm

00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:56,059
it's the possum replay tool is the name

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,070
of it and once I get internet again I'm

00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:00,799
going to update the possum project on

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:04,460
github with it the short to medium

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:07,519
version is that we take all of the

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,470
change sets that occur offline and treat

00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,120
them as git commits so we create a local

00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,490
git repository so that we can simulate

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,639
the conflicts that the OSM API would

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:19,130
produce so that we don't have to trigger

00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:20,330
a conflict figure out how to resolve it

00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,760
trigger it again figure out what the

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:26,149
next problem is by moving everything

00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,070
into into the get world we can use all

00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:31,429
of the existing get conflict resolution

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:33,919
tools to determine what those conflicts

00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:36,049
are and then to use the same tools to do

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,210
the conflict resolution where it'll pop

00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:41,120
up a pop up a text editor in this case

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,860
we're using Y Amal to represent the

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,960
nodes waves in relations as distinct

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,760
files so it'll track files that move

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,519
it'll track attributes that change

00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,559
within individual files and then once

00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,750
the rebase has occurred against whatever

00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:55,460
the current version of OpenStreetMap is

00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,559
we know that we've resolved those

00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:00,409
conflicts and maybe we want to do it

00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:02,389
again to reduce the window but again

00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:03,740
we're working in in areas that don't

00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:04,240
have a whole lot of heavy editing

00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,769
activity

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,929
so once we've once we've done that

00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:11,059
initial pass at conflict resolution we

00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:12,679
know that the likelihood of popping a

00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:15,139
conflict when we submit it to the API is

00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,240
pretty low so at that point we can start

00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:19,970
submitting those change sets up to the

00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:23,299
real OpenStreetMap API and then take the

00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:28,100
identifiers that changed because we're

00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:29,779
creating all sorts of new nodes and so I

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,320
think that actually this is maybe this

00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:34,830
is a thing for Andy if there were not a

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,130
single source of

00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:39,120
a generation for OpenStreetMap elements

00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,960
that would be incredibly beneficial

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,450
because if if we pull an extract that

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,279
has IDs one two three and four and

00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,960
people edit and create new things on

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,240
OpenStreetMap they get five six seven

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,769
eight and people are editing on possum

00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,500
they also get five six seven and eight

00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:57,960
so we have to track the differences

00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,630
there and we have to keep track of which

00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,220
elements we created offline and then

00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,440
when they get submitted to the

00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,450
OpenStreetMap api they get assigned new

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,789
identifiers we have to rewrite that

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,220
through all of the local judges so that

00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:15,090
was probably the biggest most

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:20,250
complicated part of that easy to beat

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:23,370
Bourbon really or kind of it's got a lot

00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,110
of edge cases I think that's that's the

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,250
main part of it that there are a lot of

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,899
things that you need to make sure that

00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,899
you get right for it to work properly

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,600
to avoid to reduce conflicts when you

00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:42,630
merge is it desirable for armchair

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,029
mappers outside your area to hold off

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,679
from mapping your area and is there a

00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:49,799
way of indicating that for example

00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:52,440
locking it on hot doesn't ask manager um

00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:53,789
that's that's a good idea actually but

00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,049
it's not something that I want to

00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:59,309
encourage because I mean we don't know

00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:01,200
how long these are going to be offline

00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:03,299
for so we don't want to prevent edits

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,320
from occurring elsewhere I mean that

00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,340
would be a good solution but it's

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,480
something that actually never crossed

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:10,649
our mind and I don't think it's

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,029
something that we ever will do yeah in

00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,860
this area we were less worried about it

00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:15,870
because I think we set an alert early on

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,639
in the project for anyone doing editing

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,669
in this massive area

00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:21,720
nobody was so there was no need to lock

00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:24,320
it because we were the only people

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,320
