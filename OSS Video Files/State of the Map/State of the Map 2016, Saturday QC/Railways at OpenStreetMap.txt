Railway infrastructure is a topic most people either do not know much about or do not want to know much about. It is a rather exotic topic but it has its fans. Well-known by lots of railway fans, OpenRailwayMap is a map of the railway infrastructure (tracks, signals, speed limits, electrification) but unlike other special-interest maps, it is quite country-dependent because railway signalling differs between countries very much.

Michael will present mapping and tagging of railway-specific data, how good railway-specific data currently is and highlight work work is needed to port OpenRailwayMap to more countries.
