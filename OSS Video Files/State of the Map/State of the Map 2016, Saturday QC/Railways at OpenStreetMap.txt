Railway infrastructure is a topic most people either do not know much about or do not want to know much about. It is a rather exotic topic but it has its fans. Well-known by lots of railway fans, OpenRailwayMap is a map of the railway infrastructure (tracks, signals, speed limits, electrification) but unlike other special-interest maps, it is quite country-dependent because railway signalling differs between countries very much.

Michael will present mapping and tagging of railway-specific data, how good railway-specific data currently is and highlight work work is needed to port OpenRailwayMap to more countries.

	00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:08,360
ok let's talk of today is the torque of

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,639
my career all right shot from Nakano and

00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,730
open hey Lamar and we talked about

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,390
highway mapping adapted odd at

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:23,519
openstreetmap thanks for the

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:27,960
introduction I'll talk to pay today

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,369
about railway mapping first I'll talk

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,170
about the taking of railway

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,700
infrastructure and openstreetmap of

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:38,160
tracks of stations of signals and of the

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,040
drainboard action and afterwards in the

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,670
second half of the talk I'll talk about

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,829
the mapping techniques I use and at the

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,870
last two topics as multiple some numbers

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,309
how many signals know arnab street map

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,960
and a little bit about the community

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:56,699
which maps railway infrastructure well

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,449
the infrastructure is mapped using the

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,480
oil wakey it's pretty simple just use

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:06,260
well y equals rail for railway track 2

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,729
and 4 20 other types are light rails

00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:13,560
subways mono whales and few Nicholas

00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:17,580
there are sometimes a dispute between

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,450
two and light while I 12 as a subway it

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,570
depends on the city what take what you

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:28,380
ever tell you you use ask on the local

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:32,130
mailing list or a better suitable sweded

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,460
mailing list if you're not sure if you

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,840
Mabel railway always tech or the garage

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,960
key even if it's the default coach in

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,600
this country because if no gorgeous tect

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,530
no one knows which coach the twerk

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,930
really has if it's a week well way don't

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,470
use value a wreck use value a while and

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:59,009
y equals yes or up all over our system

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,649
is used on this railway line the

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,990
electrification is checked using the

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,380
electrified key the voltage key for the

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:12,180
voltage and frequency for the frequency

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,770
of the power there's a tech which is

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,040
known only by a few member

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,880
it's called while we prefer direction it

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,460
is I suggested to take it on double

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,060
track 12 airlines disallows routing

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:29,970
engines to choose the right track

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,860
because some countries trains one on the

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,750
right like of a double track 12 airline

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,930
and some countries they use the left

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,180
track and if there's a curve between two

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,760
stations and that was all the tracks at

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,070
both stations and the routing engine may

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,920
choose the wrong track and that's not

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:50,420
good for the visualization and people

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,420
will think that the software's buggy

00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:59,280
while we usually have a life cycle I do

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,730
not in this talk I don't present the

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:08,240
life cycle in the usual way from

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:12,210
abandoned to FM proposed to dismantled I

00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:15,960
I want to first presented a most

00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:20,000
important values disused is used if the

00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,000
trailing edge the track is out of use

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:27,570
you you a pendant is used if the truck

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,870
has been removed but the ballast is

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:33,030
already there and if the drug is under

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,920
construction you use well y equals

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:40,190
construction please also take a disused

00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:44,160
equals while or a pendant equals well

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:48,410
otherwise data users cannot detect if it

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,410
was a while wait why court went like

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:57,540
these two texts are always disputed it's

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,370
the railway this metal track you find it

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,700
usually in combination with highway

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,610
cycle by your highway track these are

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,240
well way lines which the railway lines

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:11,820
but nowadays i used a cycle ways and

00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:16,410
only while we're experts see that there

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:18,900
has been a while way some years ago it's

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,120
in the valve a proposed similar these

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,070
features do not exist in reality they

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,070
just they just exist on paper

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:32,449
that's a funny thing i found a few days

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:35,779
ago it's well it's a waste well violence

00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:37,849
through the New Berlin Airport I think

00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:45,759
that such well well and should not be

00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:45,759
mapped in OpenStreetMap sorry

00:04:49,870 --> 00:05:00,690
if you add a railway track I ask you to

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,820
also tech usage or service these keys

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:07,270
tell tell the wendover if these tracks

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,010
are important or not important works are

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,640
the tracks outside of stations and

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:16,210
inside stations and the tracks which

00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:21,670
ones through the station and service is

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:25,050
used for all other tricks now come to

00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:28,750
the next topic state taking of stations

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:32,190
there are stations are sometimes take

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:38,710
aim at this notes and sometimes as areas

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:40,990
I such as you to use notes because you

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:46,780
can argue about the extent of the

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:52,090
railway station for example the thick

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:54,040
line is the area which passengers used

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,650
to describe a railway station while

00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,630
while way staff usually thinks of a

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,300
railway station form the left and we

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:07,120
signal to the right entry signal and its

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:10,600
pretty long up to a kilometer and that

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,910
therefore use a note and use other text

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:18,010
for these areas and use the relation to

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:21,480
connect them stations can be as inmate

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:26,530
week and it's quite often the gate and

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:30,000
in this case an automatically calculated

00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,200
centroid point would be very wrong

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,870
multiple hundreds of meters away from

00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:44,350
the wheel station now the railway

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:47,170
signals railway signals are mapped as

00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:51,100
nodes on the railway tracks not beside

00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:55,690
them you swallow a signal and a large

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:57,400
bunch of additional texts the one of the

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,460
most important texts will be a signal

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,650
direction it says if the die if the

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,920
signal applies to the forward direction

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,710
of the way or the

00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,250
what direction or both in this case it's

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:14,120
valve a signal which applies to the

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:16,340
further direction of the way and it gets

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,500
wellwe signal position equals which

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,550
because it is mounted on a signal which

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,980
and not white or left of the track you

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:31,160
can also add the reference number of the

00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:33,920
signal signal signal signal taking is

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,930
very complex but it needs to be complex

00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,950
because every country has its own

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:44,180
signaling system and data users should

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:46,220
be able to do a little to do some

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,040
rendering even if they don't know the

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:53,660
local signaling rules therefore we have

00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:58,190
designed 34 signal types these are some

00:07:53,660 --> 00:08:01,310
of them and they are much more and if

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,340
you map a railway signal you use railway

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:10,310
colon signal colon the type for example

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:12,560
main and the value is encoded with the

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:16,250
country the operator of the railway line

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,100
or the whole set which is used and the

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:23,600
real name of the signal for example the

00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:27,440
signal on the last slide that's a German

00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:31,790
main signal of HP type and the other is

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,910
tech 12 a signal main de- es old colon

00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:39,229
HP es 0 is the name of the rule set

00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:42,040
which is used on that line and it's

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,040
allied signal

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:52,380
Dharma the text for the hate of the

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:56,550
signal what state what aspects the

00:08:52,380 --> 00:09:00,830
signal can show and so on because while

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:03,589
signal taking is complex we only have

00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:06,600
signal texts for a few countries

00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:10,500
currently only Germany and Austria have

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:14,720
a full-time scheme the tagging scheme

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:17,400
for German 2am signals is not fully

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,300
implemented and other countries have

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:26,580
well no usable seek taking scheme at the

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:28,350
moment the right column shows how open

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,560
while my mac supports these taking

00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:35,300
schemes godly only in the

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,300
german-speaking countries and Finland

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:45,570
where we interesting topic is which

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:49,709
twine protection is used on a railway

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:52,100
line and that's a topic which should be

00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:55,020
interesting to everyone because if

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,600
terrain passes a signal which shows a

00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,870
stop aspect the drain protections should

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,770
ensure that the train stops immediately

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:08,550
even if the train driver does not stop

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:13,940
the train the taking of twine protection

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:17,970
openstreetmap is bad because there's no

00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:21,180
you good tagging scheme that train

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:25,050
protection is as country dependent than

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:29,839
the signal systems you have been

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:33,480
separate key for each system and

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:37,550
commonly it is impossible to to say

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,550
there's no train protection on this line

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,680
now I come to the second part of my talk

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,570
the mapping of while way infrastructure

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,640
you can do this either by foot or by

00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:55,740
bicycle but just use the votes or long

00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,529
railway lines sometimes there are no

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,999
votes then you have bad luck

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:06,240
you can map on wines there are plenty of

00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:09,019
ways to do this of course you can do

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,329
couch mapping I'm using ping or other

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:14,910
aerial image resources you can use

00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:17,279
photos published on while wave forms but

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,569
you should ask the photograph us

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,819
beforehand or if you can't do it has

00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:26,939
open data sets about Wi-Fi

00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:30,149
infrastructure you could think of using

00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:36,089
them as an additional source but only as

00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:43,019
an additional one if you map by foot or

00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:45,449
bicycle I I think they're using gps

00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:49,079
waypoints and notes or photos is the

00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:53,730
best one disco injured shows chashm with

00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:57,300
a railway line a parallel agricultural

00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:01,079
drag and a few waypoints in light Queen

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,180
and I have taken a waypoint at every

00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,420
signal and note it down which signal was

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:10,319
at this location and what can it display

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:15,149
and what can it show you can also use my

00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:17,850
pillow if your metal olefin mapping in

00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:19,860
turn is more difficult than mapping by

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,699
foot or by bicycle because the GPS

00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:27,870
signal entwines this week Dwayne's are a

00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:31,170
cage of metal and the GPS signal itself

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:35,509
is already weak and sometimes even the

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:38,910
windows don't let the signal through

00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:40,980
location in while way inside trains for

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:46,529
example at all or at windows which you

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:50,339
can open the German community maintains

00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:56,069
a large list of trains which are good or

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:58,790
bad for mapping the list is rather old

00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:05,480
the fiercest first into his phone about

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:09,600
2007 it shows the class number of the

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,970
Twain where it is used which receive of

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,939
us use location inside the Twain

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:18,000
how strong the signal was and some notes

00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:26,430
I don't know if other countries have

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:30,060
such lists too and inside when you have

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:32,579
multiple options to map on branch lines

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,490
I prefer to take photos through the car

00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:38,399
I've escaped but I always asked the

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:41,759
driver if he likes this and sometimes

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,120
they say no and if they say no I don't

00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:48,620
take photos for the 15 escape I use the

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,329
back drivers kept as a replacement

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:55,019
because there's no train drive under in

00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:58,939
the wheel drive escape and if there's no

00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,939
person inside it cannot be annoyed

00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:11,490
that's the photos through the rear

00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:14,490
drivers cap and if the total drivers cap

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:21,300
has a cortain I have to use a window to

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:23,459
the left of the right side sometimes I

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:28,079
take videos especially on electrified

00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:30,600
railway lines using my smartphone and

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,790
she'll check them with their scripts

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:39,149
provided by my pillowy but I've patched

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:41,309
them and these photos can be loaded into

00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:45,000
chosen and it's very comfortable for

00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:47,399
editing some lessons I learned to Ewing

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,370
mapping cameras with an optical zoom are

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,730
better because they have a larger sensor

00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:56,009
don't zoom in too much because you will

00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:00,600
lose the orientation and have

00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:03,240
difficulties to interpret the photo use

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,809
the windows on the left or right side of

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,300
the Train only as a replacement avoid

00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:12,779
filming against the Sun because windows

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:18,000
are usually dirty turn on your gps

00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:20,850
logger and extract four frames per

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,990
second always even if the train is slow

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,710
and if UV on t-shirt show everything

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,890
with

00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:33,230
an osm logo and what openstreetmap

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,230
people will ask you less often and

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,780
that's the result in this case a

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,350
screenshot of open railway map in

00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:49,050
Helsinki Central Station with all the

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:54,150
main signals and some shunting signals

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:56,940
for minor movements now as one of my

00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:00,240
last slide some numbers they are

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,970
currently almost 80,000 well signals in

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:08,610
OpenStreetMap worldwide and most of them

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:12,000
has the every direction tech and 39,000

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,490
milestones i've calculated the numbers

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,640
for the yesterday germany extract from

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:23,460
POF epic and the numbers from november

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:27,450
2015 aren't wagons there are 48 thousand

00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:34,110
signals in total 11 thousands of them

00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:36,300
our main signals on the same thousands

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,100
are distant signals end up and almost

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,220
for thousands are combined signals

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,500
combined signals are signals which

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:53,150
combine the main aspects and recent

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:55,830
aspects we have as 27,000 milestones and

00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:59,850
more than a third of the railway tracks

00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:05,910
ever speed limit information that's nice

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:10,080
to render and twelve thousand thousand

00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:13,680
or 50,000 points and have already LOL

00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:17,120
firenze number the community is

00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,120
dominated by germans

00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:31,230
and and that's problem the documentation

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:33,450
was originally written in German and

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,940
early documentation has been translated

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:40,740
into English to make the community more

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:43,080
diverse does the mailing list you will

00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,150
find postings in English and German and

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,820
some postings in both languages on the

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:55,890
list don't hesitate to ask your question

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:58,790
there or join our ilik and now I wait

00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,790
for your questions

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,840
hi I've never seen a speed limit sign on

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:26,590
tracks how do you map that well which

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:29,890
country do you come from Germany these

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:34,030
are white rectangle science with a black

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:36,280
pop pop a bottle and a number inside

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,530
there on the right side of the track

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,600
usually accept outside stations of the

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,600
left on the left leg off / line

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:04,710
thank you for those informations

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:07,830
sometimes lines who are dedicated to

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,650
regional traffic and lines of few 10

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,240
kilometers away for long distance

00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:14,460
traffic how would you tag this

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:20,490
information how important for what goal

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:28,080
is this line made for which twines use

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:29,640
the trike kind of sometimes tractor

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,800
dedicate for regional traffic because of

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,890
a very heavy regional traffic and a very

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,960
heavy long-distance traffic so they're

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:40,200
kind of dedicated to some different

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,100
traffic there's currently no taking

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:47,220
scheme for this use the hood relations

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,890
and a good routing engine for high-speed

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:54,200
trains will avoid tracks which are used

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,200
heavily by light rail doings

00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:13,279
and so for the numbers of Germany can

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:17,700
you tell how good to coverages well

00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:20,220
there are a few spots where most signals

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,940
are mapped and our large areas where no

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:26,760
signals are mapped if you have a look

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,029
you will find only a few contributors

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:33,659
and can see which lines are usually used

00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:35,309
for the travel for example the railway

00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:38,340
line from prison to strip Carter's map

00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:40,919
very well or all the southwest of

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:51,059
Germany because they are currently about

00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:52,649
form APIs which map in parallel no no I

00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,789
was just going to ask what your coverage

00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:55,789
was like as well and if you're finished

00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:19,910
yeah thanks again how many of the 80,000

00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:25,580
railway signals the tube map I sing

00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:27,230
about eight hundred two thousand thank

00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,140
you thank you for a nice presentation I

00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,960
always ruse railways as a good example

00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,360
of openstreetmap assets has no layers so

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,480
I put for example here in Brussels rail

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,610
right ram and the same way as high very

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,500
residential because it's at some extra

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,260
information for bicycle rooting for

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,400
example so could you elaborate a little

00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:51,620
bit why do you like this approach and

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,559
better I think it's a good idea I think

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:56,690
that tagging the railway key on the same

00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:01,070
way as the highway key is not a good

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:03,559
idea because if you have good aerial

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,800
imagery you should map each railway

00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:11,570
track itself therefore you have on usual

00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:16,670
residential street to dwell at one place

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:19,370
and one way for the car traffic it is

00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:21,679
physically at the same area so that the

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:24,860
tram is in the traffic jam of the cars

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,380
for 8 or the bicycle route goes on the

00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:31,630
on the tram line so I can fall into them

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:35,150
I know the problem I'm all also cyclist

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:39,140
is it a single track tram line or does

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:43,280
it have two twigs usually two tracks but

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:45,920
the road is on the track but how do you

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,320
want to do 12 routing if you only have

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,510
one trike in OpenStreetMap are two in

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,720
reality to in reality to in

00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:58,929
OpenStreetMap but on top the highway

00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:11,870
tech well

00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:14,330
yes I may have an answer for the

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,519
question how to map railway lines and on

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,519
highway tracks in class we have the same

00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:22,220
problem ments urged us to split up the

00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,649
railway lines from the highway and what

00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,750
solution did we come to we map the

00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:29,299
railway lines where the lanes tagged

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,600
with met railway column lanes and

00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:34,850
tantrum a Bartram and so we have the

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,269
relation on which side of the street to

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:41,830
a trains run on the highway key and we

00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:41,830
have the right balance as an extra way

00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,510
last question yeah just like quickly

00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,820
whoa what do you do with tram trains

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:57,049
there are quite a few trams that also

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:59,899
run on Trent train tracks for example in

00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:02,330
giving em to begin to you bringin does

00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:04,610
not have a 12 okay they plan to have a

00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,470
tram sorry future house or a car through

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:10,490
a nice way cuz you think of Carla's

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:13,639
right yes cars are freaking well the

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,309
inside town that the train runs on tram

00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:19,490
tracks but outside uses normal train

00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:23,360
tracks and after you use root equals to

00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:30,289
M but the infrastructure is tech as it

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:34,429
is I will just ask a last question if

00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:38,269
you know me about the tagging screen

00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:42,789
okay you I mean the tagging scheme is

00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:45,500
made is meant to meet on the waist right

00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:48,380
but I imagine a situation you go in

00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,570
which you have one right away which with

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,649
the bridge afterwards and then the right

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:57,169
way that continues on the bridge and I

00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:59,539
propose some how to get the order

00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:02,000
information in a relation that contact

00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:05,260
all the ways what do you think about

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,659
that well we already have food relations

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:12,169
both for the services on the railway

00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:17,570
track and the railway line itself

00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:20,239
I mean about the lining what I did we

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:22,519
what line is safe that I also give you

00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:26,179
say I think it's refers to cross a

00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:32,840
bridge you use thi use type equals food

00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:37,190
equals 2x I didn't get you you you may

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:41,830
be like I can show it you I can show it

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:45,950
you in shorts and later okay it's okay

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:48,999
