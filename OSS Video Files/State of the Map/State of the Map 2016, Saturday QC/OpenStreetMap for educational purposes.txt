I work a lot on how we can use OpenStreetMap with children in many ways for many objectives (knowing our daily environment, talking about commons, sharing our knowledge…). We also have experience of work with youth workers in social center, etc. We would like to share our initiatives, our experiences to spread OSM in direction of youngs in the world.

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,160
wear from cheery odda and we talked

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:13,099
about openstreetmap for educational

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:18,240
purposes okay okay I'm good afternoon

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:28,199
when a prima de Bible rule so i will

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:31,500
talk about mapping problem it's a mac he

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,130
is free to do but alas okay so talk

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:50,010
about mapping from seven to 77 years old

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:52,530
or more so first I come from okay I come

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,860
from the far west so not the American

00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:02,340
far west okay just to explain if you

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:04,920
live if you if you leave Brussels you go

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,350
through Paris well don't stop there's

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,810
nothing much to see there you just go to

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,700
the far west and you will arrive at the

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:19,710
end of the continent of France and just

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,960
after our place okay it will work after

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:27,420
our place where you will see a Canada

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,900
sometimes some days and beautiful

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,900
sunsets

00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:42,370
so I lived there but we I work mainly in

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:46,420
France sometimes I go abroad in Belgium

00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:48,860
but not much and I work for an

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,140
organization called period it means

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,090
territory in bottle because I live in

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,960
the place where we speak French on board

00:01:53,090 --> 00:02:01,580
or it's a Catholic language we work

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:07,760
mainly to with them big organizations

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:09,710
NGOs local governments on the new ideas

00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,830
of all territories are we will work

00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:16,960
together we will work as a with a

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:20,450
collaborative project to imagine you

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,950
territories so you have all the things

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:28,610
for my credit card and things like that

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:34,700
on the on there it's perfect okay it's

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:40,000
coming so we for the last two years

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:44,270
we've tried many experiences with the

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,620
with educators teachers around

00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:53,420
openstreetmap from kids about five on

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,700
six years old to students but I've I've

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,420
chosen today to show you all the

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:03,160
experiences we did with the kids about

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,160
from eight to twelve years old

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,010
so that's the place so i invite you to

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,500
come the sunset is beautiful and you can

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:24,180
do mapping with the kayak that's how

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,920
we'll do the map in there and maybe if

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,890
we are interested in that it's because

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,230
we we have questions about how we can

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,620
find innocent victims to work with us

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,360
and maybe two maybe one day they will

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,450
choose to be golden or some contributors

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,820
more than golden boys at Wall Street

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:46,320
memory may be members of the USM

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:49,160
foundation or osm france or probably

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,480
simply that's what we like in when we do

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,030
education about open source it's just

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,840
that they choose their technologies

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,580
their project and documents so I will

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,550
just show you three workshops we did

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,380
with kids I will like to have your

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,209
reactions or the things where you think

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,000
about it and maybe to share your

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,610
experiences after that so first one we

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,890
that we do quite often is to fill the

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,989
map on a small small town small sword

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,470
zone with information given by children

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:22,770
we live in the place so you probably all

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,720
know the expert Miami in New York and

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,180
things like that so when we work with

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,940
kids we always say that we are kind of

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,979
expert of geography but usually we don't

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,750
know the place they are the expert of

00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:39,600
the place so for this workshop it's

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:44,060
washer about 45 to 60 minutes or an hour

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:48,510
with kids usually we does one any matter

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:51,180
if they are to its better kids no more

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,930
than 12 because they have many things to

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,930
say and it's better with kids between

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,919
nine and ten for opportunity point of

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:07,919
view so you see my colleague working

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:09,960
here with kids in front of the screen so

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,320
first we just explained the game you say

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,920
we are kind of specialist of mapping we

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:20,750
are not specialists of the town

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:23,460
could you help us to fill the the map of

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,680
course we ask you do you know some maps

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,680
on internet and fortunately they know

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,110
more more then no more google maps than

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,770
openstreetmap but that's the beginnings

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,540
normal and we say can we compete on

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,700
which start talking about the maps on

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,900
the things you can do or not on internet

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:44,630
and so we suggest that we can change

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,370
things because when we show the map

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,320
sometimes we use a map compared to show

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:54,720
the maps and they say okay many things

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:57,150
are missing we have things to say so

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,160
first we start by a simple places

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:03,330
where's your school on the map we start

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,550
by the school we try to not get on the

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,500
map so it's very difficult for even

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:12,450
sometimes for adults to look at a map on

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,180
nowhere where we away is on the map and

00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:17,490
with the kids it's the same so we use

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,020
sometimes google street view so don't

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,190
say anything to anybody okay it's just

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:27,600
hear everything that happens here in the

00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:30,090
vsam stay here so we use more now map

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,450
allari when it exists so that's why you

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:37,890
know causes with the kids we have

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:40,680
started to work with map Yuri and we

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:44,400
just three switch between two screens

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,500
one that they are working safe from from

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,950
for example the school when you go

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,420
outside the school and you want to buy

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,030
you want to go to the bakery how do you

00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,060
do it so they the guide us in this in

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,070
the town and on the other screen we

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:04,740
tried us to find the place the right

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:06,360
place so it's many time talking with

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,240
them because sometimes when they go

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,060
outside say well when you go to buy a

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,000
good French what song they say okay this

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,680
place out this place and we say okay

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,230
with that support there's a problem

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,080
somewhere but they start discussing

00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,540
about which one is the best one so they

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,370
start talking about the deli their daily

00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,420
life the underly play something like

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:32,010
that and sometimes winter

00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,250
use things about because we work a lot

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:37,650
on that is it okay if course someone

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,290
comes with a wheelchair to say why I

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:43,710
don't know what okay was the point so we

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:48,750
talked about we share sometimes wheezing

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:52,020
we shall maps a replication and after

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:54,780
that we don't do we don't collect a lot

00:07:52,020 --> 00:08:00,000
of data it's not like in your country

00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:04,890
yes I'm sorry we use the notes because

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,490
it's an easy way in one hour to to point

00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:10,200
things on the map so you see here the

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:15,180
kids they were trying to show where was

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:18,090
the entrance of the cinema and everyone

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,710
was showing a different entrance some

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,130
some the main entrance the servants

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:26,730
entrance etc so we they put the notes on

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:29,430
the map at the end there were many notes

00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:31,680
like that on the map it's quite easy you

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,290
don't need to have an account you just

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,510
have to put some notes on the map and

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:41,160
that for when our way it works quite

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:43,979
well workshop to fill the map on a very

00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,080
small zone with information given by

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,330
children but that they have previously

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,430
they need to have previously visited a

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:56,280
place we need usually two sessions one

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:59,100
in the morning one in the afternoon to

00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,920
any matters that's one it's nutty is not

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:06,300
possible kids around nine to ten years

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,030
old it's organized in 2001 outside in

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,880
the morning usually to visit or discover

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:15,440
place a museum square north building and

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:20,310
in the afternoon for an hour not more a

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,710
session indoor with the group I'll give

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,170
you an example in Allah in the South of

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,960
France I don't know if we say Audrina or

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:31,710
bull ring or ok you see what it is ok

00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:34,690
that's why we kill the boss

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:37,990
so in the morning with we organized a

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,630
visit in the morning just to to see the

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,420
place but even to talk with them with

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,540
about things that they would have not

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:50,320
noticed for example are their toilets

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,600
are the acts what's the accessibility

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,600
and the disabled people can enter on

00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:00,070
visit this place or not so we talked a

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,990
lot about the place in the morning it

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:06,660
was just talking visiting and nothing

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:10,030
else when they came back at the at lunch

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:13,000
and after that and start the afternoon

00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:17,950
you know everybody feels asleep at four

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,160
clock in the South of France so just

00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:23,620
that to make something more funny we

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,250
organized the subjective draw drawing

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,170
session with the children to encourage

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,110
them to put on their drawings all the

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,790
things that they saw in the morning it

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,620
was quite funny because they put things

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,220
that they saw in the morning but also

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:43,690
things that they are in their minds for

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:47,410
example they put a lot of kind of lights

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:49,540
everywhere I'm so why you didn't you

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,480
didn't see lights in the morning in the

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,600
arena it just because every summer they

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,610
are concerts in the arena so they put

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,470
things that adding their mind on things

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:10,680
that is soon sorry in the morning after

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:14,020
that we withdraw it on the on the world

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,630
we just we showed a openstreetmap and

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:20,020
with a white white screen we were just

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:24,280
drawing the arena while the children

00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:27,070
were drawing icon on small pieces of its

00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,190
to represent some specific elements they

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:33,310
saw in the morning after that they

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:35,740
placed the elements on the wall just

00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,050
like as you see here and at the same

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,900
time there was someone else on the

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:44,750
computer that put all the different

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:48,480
elements on the maps so at the end

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:52,500
they did some work some subjective work

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,540
some objective work they went outside it

00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,700
went inside and they did some work with

00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,920
the computers on the put informations

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,660
and at the end there was a map we show

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,090
them the map the results at the end of

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,770
the decision with for example the toilet

00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,870
and secure that there are more

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:13,320
informations but in map ninka you can

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:16,910
see everything so the third one to fill

00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,310
them up tiny space again and also to

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:26,310
from tiny space to a place for when the

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:29,100
world half day the person sorry two

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:34,800
people okay 20 meters from seven years

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:36,600
old too doesn't matter 15 and this

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,280
workshop is to allow children to switch

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,500
from from Rio to virtual from objective

00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,380
to subject you things physical to

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:50,910
digital and here and somewhere else in

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,010
the world that's how we started we

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,400
started by representing their village

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,740
their place with a pieces of wood paper

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,410
and things like that so you see the

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,120
world drawing the their place they put

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:08,760
parkings buildings trees I'd not see

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:13,470
each group was representing his place or

00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:15,630
his vision of his place after that on

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,690
the wall we put openstreetmap with a

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,040
white screen again and they were all

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,020
drawing with the hand that was very

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,260
important with the hand all the

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,910
buildings on while they were drawing the

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,380
buildings you said that there's

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,780
something here in the building it's not

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:34,950
written that's my school that's the

00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:38,220
bakery and they just said but we did

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,450
things physical physically under this so

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,550
that in the different groups all the

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,100
physical physically things that they've

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,720
done we're not the same some put more

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,730
trees than the others some put more

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,160
roads than the others and when they were

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:54,840
drawing this so that in OpenStreetMap it

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:58,040
was not good neither okay so they say

00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,949
but can we do a good map can we go to do

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,519
where everything is on the map so of

00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:07,910
course we talked about openstreetmap and

00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:11,630
we started to put some nuts again on the

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,550
map with kids these kids are this one is

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,670
about five years old and the 16 years

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:19,670
old so that quite young so bad we helped

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:23,959
them to put the notes and each time we

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:26,600
put the name of the kid is named adjust

00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:29,240
to his surname it's um it's ur name and

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,029
welcome from under like that very much

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:36,649
to say that o their name is somewhere on

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:38,899
the web on the worldwide 11 project but

00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:40,730
we said okay we've done that here can we

00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:43,579
do that again somewhere else in the

00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:48,079
world maybe some needs that so it was

00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:52,130
just when there was a project for Ebola

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:56,029
without so we say okay if we can show

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:58,310
you that some people need your help fri

00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,740
bola do you know about Ebola so we

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,779
talked about it well now with them and

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:06,589
you could you can help us so of course

00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:10,670
they said wow that's not possible so we

00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:13,300
show them the scissor EOS m here in a

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:16,399
bola and not not very far from Freetown

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,860
so they've started with the pen on the

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,850
whiteboard first be a before going

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:25,459
really working with the agosm after that

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:29,329
they work with the GOM it was quite

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:32,569
funny because same took a place where

00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:35,510
all the the houses were squared so they

00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:37,519
were always with the touch the queue

00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,860
okay on the computer to have something

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,920
really Square and the others do to have

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,630
something around and they have the

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,430
changed after that because some debate

00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,880
but why do you use this one a new on

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,889
this one so but the houses are round no

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,630
the offices are square and because

00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:56,360
somewhere some somewhere in the

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,310
landscape very far from a frightened and

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,319
the others were just near freedom so

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,959
they talked about how hard I OSIS

00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,939
idiocies in these countries and how is

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:09,079
organized the country I think that so we

00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:11,420
talked a lot about the country and at

00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:15,920
the end they presented

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,240
all their work to the parents and it was

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,920
quite funny because when the parents

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,850
arrived and they said what have you done

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,830
we've done a bola you've done Ebola what

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,930
does this mean we've abductors we've

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:31,850
helped open n Gio's that's not okay and

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,070
they all said so they showed their work

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,710
and they said okay now we come to eat at

00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:39,890
home we've done it so we'd have to do it

00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:44,480
with you parents okay now so we're

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:53,240
working so that's just our some images

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:56,180
of what happened so for us some of the

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,910
the things that we have been in from

00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:02,540
from these experiences some of the

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:05,660
benefits we saw is that it's a good tool

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,430
to go outside well we like that we like

00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:12,050
when the kids are outside and not always

00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:14,630
behind that computer so for us it's okay

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,790
i was before in an environment educator

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:19,520
say that okay so i was always working

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,830
with kids outside so when internet

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,650
arrived and rather pandigital things huh

00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:27,560
i saw all the kids behind the computers

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:31,670
are never outside in the garden and from

00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:33,920
its pity say that yeah and so i like i

00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,680
like computers ok I've digital things

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,510
but I'd like to see the kids outside and

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:42,980
when we use when we use digital tools

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:46,400
like tablets smartphones computers and

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,260
they go outside because we we tell them

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,110
that they can do that but they have to

00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,270
go outside to see things and we can work

00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,680
with things that they like to have in

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:58,580
their in their hands so for us it's a

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,560
openstreetmap can be a really good

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,170
project to go outside again with kids

00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:07,610
you know that geography it's better when

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:09,530
you go outside to do to do geography the

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,450
usefulness of the assignment children

00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,640
especially like that their work serves a

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,900
purpose the same for everybody but

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,120
especially for the kids because usually

00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:23,230
it's not really the case at school so it

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,480
isn't just graded on forgotten the

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,760
dos well especially the educators not

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,620
always the teachers trust them or let

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,530
them participating so they do what they

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,540
want to do we help them but that sauce

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:38,500
their work it's their work it's not our

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:42,040
work and they ask many questions about

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:44,169
the idea of comments even one day

00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,809
someone's in bed are you doing commons

00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:51,610
say you are eight years old you know

00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:53,530
what other comments and are you paid for

00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,360
that because they say okay you say that

00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,000
the two million volunteers everywhere in

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,000
the world doing that under the free ad

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,890
free time but you are you paid to do

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,070
that with us so we talked about

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,900
collaborative economy okay we say okay

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,030
some are volunteers some update because

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,250
here I'm doing a training course I can

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:14,620
pay for that even if behind there's

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:18,750
openstreetmap on things and so there are

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,750
many talks are found very interesting

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,419
collaboration without boundaries

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,160
involvement in a free and open project

00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:28,660
all around the world that works very

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:32,650
well with kids understanding ow look

00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:35,049
look like other countries we use quite a

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:39,390
lot a manatorian project because it's

00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:43,120
quite easy to use gos em in just to draw

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:47,260
roads or houses okay it's quite simple

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:50,169
and because when we do nots this okay

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,299
not okay perfect but that's not really

00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:54,460
the contribution I want to do the real

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:56,950
contribution socio seems more

00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,470
complicated but with even Italian

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:03,850
project it was quite well at school am

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,620
for maybe sometimes for the first time

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,440
they are free to do what they want to do

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,260
each child canavese proper project is

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,780
proper contribution usually we have

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,990
global project but is projected just to

00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:20,080
put his house it's bakery and you can do

00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:23,020
it so always the question are can I

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,510
should I and say okay just do it copying

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,780
is not theft or the teachers don't like

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,850
that very much but doesn't matter I'm

00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,130
not that I'm not there for the game

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,120
teachers they like to see their name on

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:38,600
an auto and contribution

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:43,610
and as we saw we liked the work on

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:46,550
subjective on objective environment of

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:52,100
the cedar environment maybe two or three

00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:55,130
things that can limit participation the

00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:58,250
ability we have so the pedagogy to adapt

00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:00,260
our goals their goals and the available

00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:04,280
time to a John context it's not very

00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:07,190
that easy so for example if you work at

00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,230
school or not at school in a social

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,420
Center in fact it's not the same at

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,820
school they they note that they have to

00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,920
be seated how quiet the things than that

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,740
if it's not at school that's not the

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,179
thing is they just want to play football

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:23,630
okay so it's more complicated to get

00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:25,400
them behind the computer for an hour and

00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,860
the equipment and school okay sometimes

00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:34,460
we you don't have computers not a smart

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:36,920
phones internet don't work very well the

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,530
teachers okay some teachers are ready

00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,350
yet they have perfect they say it's a

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:45,380
good projects the super we will do we do

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:47,990
many things with kids but we have to

00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,809
think at the beginning are we can get

00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:53,059
them involved in the project how do we

00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,429
work after the project because usually

00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:57,640
we go just for an hour sometimes for two

00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:00,890
days after that we are leaving the place

00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:05,059
so out the educators or the teachers are

00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:08,420
also trained to continue the job do they

00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:11,660
have the skills do the except to be at

00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:14,510
the same level than the children that's

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:17,090
sometimes complicated because sometimes

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:20,030
we started with the kids they put notes

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,860
they started gos em and the teacher the

00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:24,710
end said yeah but I will not do it again

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:27,920
because for me it's very complicated

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,870
okay and so you have to think at the

00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,320
beginning if you will start by training

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:37,429
the teacher and the kids after or not it

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:40,550
depends on the teacher even at lower

00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:42,310
lever it happens sometimes first there

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:45,380
are thousands of possible uses for

00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:48,320
pennsic map with kids but we need mr.

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:51,320
geek + 2 3 4 5

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,330
for many predictions okay when they do

00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:57,470
them they do some of their contributions

00:22:53,330 --> 00:23:01,370
and what else Adi after that we see

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:03,860
maddening something else something nicer

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:06,769
something that the kids like to see and

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,179
not flat a light mad ninja but maybe for

00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:11,049
the kids that's not the thing they would

00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:14,980
like to see after their contribution and

00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:17,990
they come they can't do it by themselves

00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,700
and maybe choose to express the

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:22,340
impressions to put some subjective

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:30,350
opinions analysis on open street map

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:34,220
something less objective the thanks for

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:36,830
your attention we I I've learned what

00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:39,470
was a teacher SME two days ago so I

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:41,840
would like now to share what we've done

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,210
on teacher I am so maybe we can do a

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:48,100
workshop tomorrow I don't know to start

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:50,659
the French of a person under Spanish I

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,480
don't know if he you can say that in

00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:56,240
English but in in France in on network

00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,899
we say that we would like to to write

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,970
the source code ok like the free

00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:04,669
software's or the received like when you

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,529
do the cooking it's more like like what

00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:08,480
I've done just some elements but after

00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:11,509
that all the things that you have

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,850
experienced ok if you put some nuts some

00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:15,950
others have done that but I would like

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:19,340
to know if someone has done that with

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:23,299
kids were 15 years old not at school in

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:25,940
Africa what's happening because the

00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:29,269
recipie is the same ok you have to be 12

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,980
one hour well things like that but some

00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:32,419
contexts are difference so I would like

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:36,289
to share that with you so if you have

00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:41,440
other experiences to share with us just

00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:41,440
do it on questions as well thank you

00:24:48,470 --> 00:25:05,970
so we just have time for one question

00:24:51,769 --> 00:25:07,649
the question yeah yeah so thank you so

00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,200
much this is really fascinating working

00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:12,929
with the children um I work at a

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:17,820
university and we organize chapters of

00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:20,909
students to to work on humanitarian osm

00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,169
projects and they all really immediately

00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:23,429
think of a project they want to do they

00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:25,470
want to work with their high school kids

00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:28,289
or work with other kids we do have this

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,850
complicated a factor that often to do

00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:31,679
that they have to go through some

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,259
specialized training of abuse

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,210
recognition something you know in

00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:39,389
working with minors is there something

00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:41,340
about that that you have encountered you

00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:43,379
have this you know way to do that how

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,000
that's one limitation that I see of

00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:47,730
being able to do more and more of this

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,379
to have you dealt with that or do you

00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:56,000
have that problem I probably don't

00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:59,129
understand the well the question sorry

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,620
in order to work with children we at the

00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:03,480
University we even my students and a

00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:08,159
meet we have to take a specialized

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:10,230
training in recognizing abuse child

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,090
abuse or working with minors there's all

00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,580
sorts of subjects that we need to be

00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:16,320
certified in to be evil able to work

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,529
with children do you have this problem

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,299
and if you do how do you overcome that

00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:25,370
so that you can work more and more with

00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:29,840
children I don't have this problem

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,840
hahaha I'm sorry

00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:48,210
no I didn't have that all the the

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,770
parents they like that very much to see

00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,810
that that we see that that kids they do

00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:55,380
something else the cheese teachers as

00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:57,030
well and there's no question of when I

00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,060
say innocent victims at the beginning

00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:06,780
okay so it was the Joker I'm sorry maybe

00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:08,460
it's a friend joke okay known as no

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,030
question of that I've never heard the

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,030
