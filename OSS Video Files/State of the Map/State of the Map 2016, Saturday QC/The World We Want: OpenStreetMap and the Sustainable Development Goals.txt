In early 2016, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) made a commitment to the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data. As part of this process, HOT mapped the work of the global OSM community to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Incredibly, (or perhaps not so surprisingly), it was found that the global OSM community is contributing to nearly all of the goals.

This talk aims to raise awareness of the many ways that OSM data, and also the process by which it is generated, are contributing to a more equitable world. From measuring financial inclusion in Uganda (Goal 1: No Poverty), to providing vocational training and jobs (Goal 4: Quality Education), to mapping housing conditions and access to basic services in informal settlements (Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities), OSM is front and centre in each of these projects.

	00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,879
so good morning everybody welcome back

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,560
on a second day of state of the map and

00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,929
the first session will be about a

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,210
humanitarian aspect of state map most of

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,910
you are probably familiar with the

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,029
humanitarian OpenStreetMap team and the

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:21,990
first sessions will be about their

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,820
efforts and the last session will be so

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,859
what unusual we're going to invite a

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,779
guest speaker from Africa and this

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,689
session will be with a translator who is

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,940
still underway so I hope you will arrive

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,370
in time to get that session running as

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,219
well for the remainder of the day I

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,680
advise you to check the schedule it will

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,270
be updated specifically for the birds of

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,030
a feather session and the lightning

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,160
talks where are some changes tonight at

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,440
seven there will be an excursion

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,320
organized in the context of the social

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,530
event and this will be due to the event

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,620
brewery of Brussels so who of you would

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,530
be interested in that they can register

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,580
to the registration desk in the Nelson

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,470
Mandela to avoid further schedule

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,110
problems I suggest we start a session

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,479
despite most attendee still underway

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,270
apparently I invite our first speaker

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,549
who will introduce us to their work on

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:24,780
the humanitarian OpenStreetMap team and

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:27,240
applause please all right good morning

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,100
everyone again and thank you for

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,759
choosing to be an auditorium see this

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,320
morning so i'm tyler from hot today I'm

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,960
not necessarily going to be talking

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,110
about hot i'm going to be talking about

00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,180
some ideas and concepts like if you

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,939
attended mikal's talk yesterday i have

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,560
slides but a little bit of this is food

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,060
for thought and how you can all be

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,210
working towards the sustainable

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,210
development goals so let's get started

00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,530
so in the year 2000 the UN approved the

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,509
Millennium Development Goals that or the

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,909
MDGs these were a framework of eight

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:08,250
goals and wide-ranging practical steps

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:10,050
on how we get there so the mg MDGs had a

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,209
profound effect they help to lift more

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,200
than 1 billion people out of extreme

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,000
poverty

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,519
on this is the number of people living

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,510
on less than one dollar and 25 cent per

00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:26,790
day worldwide between the years 1990 up

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:29,250
to 2015 but many were left behind in

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,349
that process and success was measured at

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,480
the national level meaning that a

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,860
country could achieve a goal but still

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,380
have millions of people who are not

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,780
counted or simply left out and if you

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,510
see this take a look at this photo here

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,530
presumably the children on the left

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:49,140
we're not receiving a basic education as

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:52,829
an example vietNamNet some MDGs ahead of

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,769
schedule so number two on education in

00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:57,269
the year 2000 but children from the

00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:58,890
poorest households were still more than

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,319
twice as likely to die before their

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,299
fifth birthday as children from the

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:10,230
wealthiest in nearly five times more

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:12,840
likely to be out of school on 25th

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,870
September 2015 so just about one year

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,410
ago a new framework was adopted by the

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,639
UN as well as international partners and

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,010
this is called the sustainable

00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,859
development goals starting in 2015 and

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,690
running for the next 15 years so I'd

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:30,959
like to ask him ask us to think about

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,000
today how do we get there we need to get

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,889
below the national level in terms of

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,420
measuring progress really down to the

00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,069
micro level and that's where I'm going

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,799
to argue that openstreetmap can play a

00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,209
role and this is not just a UN thing

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,489
this is something that we can all

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,079
contribute to and in fact we all need to

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,829
contribute to in order to be able to

00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:53,130
achieve so these are the 17 goals of the

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:55,709
sustainable development goals it's quite

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,200
simply the largest collective effort in

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,109
history to improve the lives of billions

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,450
of people by setting quantitative goals

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,579
and targets to drive evidence-based

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,430
Polly policymaking and the whole thing

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:11,160
the whole concept relies on improving

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,730
the quality of data around these 17

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,940
goals so to make things more complex

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,519
there's not only 17 goals there's 169

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,770
targets so each goal has multiple

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,990
targets each target has multiple

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,020
indicators so we have two hundred and

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,090
early indicators across the 17 goals so

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,490
there's an incredible global data

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,580
challenge as you can imagine and because

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,590
these measures are being tracked I've

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,090
been at each country level and within

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,639
each country at the sub-national level

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,060
on it really makes things incredibly

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:49,860
complex so you have 193 countries

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:51,870
tracking 230 indicators and so I I'd

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,460
like to argue that we have an incredible

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,090
opportunity to help here as the

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,759
OpenStreetMap community huge need for

00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,669
data especially open data especially

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,099
open geospatial data I just took one

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,050
quote out from the ung a resolution that

00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,940
was passed at the time when the goals

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,389
were adopted and I'll read that so

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,919
quality accessible timely and reliable

00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:15,330
disaggregated data will be needed to

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,190
help with the measurement of progress

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,680
and to ensure that no one is left behind

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,889
so when we talk about no one left behind

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,389
a big component to that is

00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:27,389
disaggregating below the national level

00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,370
so getting down to sub-national in terms

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,280
of to the province to the sub province

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,840
on even within a city to the individual

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,659
neighborhood level or the individual

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,229
block level national level stats are no

00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:42,930
longer good enough so much of this data

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:45,719
is tracked by bureaus of National Bureau

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:48,240
of Statistics which is really great in

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:50,610
something and really the they are

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,110
responsible for leading this effort but

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,389
they don't have everything so a lot of

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,490
things are still paper-based in closed

00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:00,180
systems or just never simply never

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:02,009
collected below the national level I'll

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,469
give you one example of that from Sierra

00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:06,750
Leone so a study was done called the

00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:09,120
post-2015 data test this was a basically

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,580
a study to see okay is the world ready

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,409
for the SDGs in terms of measurement and

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,539
data readiness and this is you know just

00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:22,289
one example they looked at Sierra Leone

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,849
and what you see here is the number on

00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:26,069
the left side is the number of

00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:28,680
indicators for that particular goal so

00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:31,099
if you look for example that let's look

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,469
at environment and Disaster resilience

00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:36,690
so what you see there is in blue there's

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:37,820
three indicators where data was

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,070
available

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,770
and two indicators where data is not

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,840
available or no data existed and so you

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,850
can see everything in orange means that

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,610
no data currently exists around these

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,920
goals and you can see what those are

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,200
energy and infrastructure environment

00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,940
and disaster resilience these are things

00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,080
that we are able to track and measure

00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,430
and openstreetmap and so let me talk

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,750
through a few examples of those and

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:09,230
before I get there to recap the MDGs

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:11,750
eight goals the SDG 17 goals so there's

00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:14,540
a marked difference here and a lot of

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,770
that difference is around on the things

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,780
I just talked about energy and

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,880
infrastructure environment and Disaster

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,830
resilience and governance and this is

00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,930
really core to to what we're doing in

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:30,590
osm in many cases let's let's get into

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:33,230
the some examples so the government

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,940
can't do this alone really we as the

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,460
OpenStreetMap community need to partner

00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,280
with governments at the national level

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,800
and local level and it's not only

00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,390
openstreetmap community other ngos

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,790
community-based organizations

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,170
faith-based organizations the private

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,680
sector all have a role to play in

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:53,780
achieving the goals so the whole concept

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,380
of the SDGs is relatively new there it's

00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,120
only one year old now but osm

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,220
communities have been around for quite a

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,740
bit longer than that and so on the left

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,500
you see this is our the Indonesia

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:09,410
community on the right is map Kabara

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:15,170
supporting a the White House mapathon

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:16,820
this year so let's think a little bit

00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,450
about what OpenStreetMap data might be

00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,830
good for and one of the key ones and one

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,600
of the most obvious things that we'll

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,660
talk about first is filling data gaps

00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,970
and helping to monitor the progress of

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,970
the SDGs so really using data from

00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:34,880
openstreetmap combined with analysis in

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:38,390
in GIS software to help measure some of

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,599
those 230 indicators so let's let's go

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:44,240
through a few examples so looking at

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,010
goal 3 good health and well-being this

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,290
talks about achieving universal health

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,050
coverage and there's multiple indicators

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,080
here but just one example of those is on

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,660
health worker density and distribution

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,720
so these are things as we track health

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,899
facility locations in OpenStreetMap we

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,180
can also use sort of add on platforms

00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,680
one of those is health sites which some

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,870
of you may have heard about on Thursday

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,640
to track additional additional

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,070
attributes like how many health workers

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,200
are at a location on and where are those

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,690
where are those health workers actually

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,570
station and what are they doing and so

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,430
osm data can combine with other

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,640
platforms like health sites can serve as

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:27,170
a starting point for analyzing

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:33,079
population against the catchment area or

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:35,810
the service area of a health facility so

00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:39,620
when we look at goal number six this is

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,790
around clean water and sanitation one

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,170
indicator we can measure with

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,779
openstreetmap proportion of the

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,760
population using see using safely

00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,850
managed sanitation services including

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,190
hand washing facility so in many of many

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,829
communities around the world are

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:59,649
tracking and generating data on things

00:09:54,829 --> 00:10:03,110
like public toilets on drinking water on

00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:04,490
hand washing at in facilities in schools

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,520
for example so these are all things that

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,440
we can track in in OpenStreetMap this is

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,550
a photo from darussalam during the

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,860
seasonal flooding that occurs so the

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,230
goal number eight around this is around

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,670
on financial inclusion and when we think

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,060
of financial inclusion what it really

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,980
means is do people have access to the

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,570
financial system in some way do they

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,339
have access to a bank account so that

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,870
they can save money and in many cases

00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,420
where there are no banks do they have

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,520
access to mobile money so basically an

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,860
account on their phone where for the

00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,449
first time people aren't storing away

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,459
money in a shoebox are under the

00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:44,990
mattress they can actually have it in a

00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:47,750
safe secure on account and so one thing

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,209
that humanitarian OpenStreetMap team has

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,579
been doing in uganda is working to track

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:55,519
all those locations and record them in

00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:58,399
osm so the map that you see overlaid on

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,279
the image here is a visual of all those

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,680
locations throughout Uganda and this can

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,870
be used to track progress against

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,480
indicators like

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,910
the proportion of adults that have an

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,250
account we can overlay population data

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,110
with data from open street map to see

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:18,970
who's who's within a reasonable distance

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:21,820
of an access point and who is not around

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,440
transportation so goal number 11 is

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,089
sustainable cities and communities do

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,270
people have axed convenient access to

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:30,880
public transport so this is a this photo

00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:34,960
was taken in dar Salam you can see this

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,589
is our version of GPS tracks on a

00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:41,770
bicycle and this is also from darussalam

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:43,779
on cycle caravan on the World

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:48,970
Environment Day this year which was john

00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:50,589
june 5th so goal 11 is something that I

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,390
have a few slides on goal 11 because

00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:55,000
this is one of the most critical goals

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:59,800
around sustainable cities as the world

00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,600
continues to urbanize a huge proportion

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,020
of the population are living in slums or

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,970
informal settlements or just do not have

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,120
access to adequate and safe housing and

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,620
so in Tanzania the local osm community

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,740
which many of you have heard about the

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,839
last few days romani Korea has now put

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,700
an area home to approximately 3 million

00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,830
people onto the map for the first time

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,020
and through that data we can gauge how

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:29,260
many people are living in informal

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:32,200
settlements another one talking about

00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,870
water related disasters we can met track

00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,120
and measure things like on which homes

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,250
and houses are vulnerable to flooding so

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,150
in in dar Salam the romani Korea team

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,500
had mapped over two hundred sixty-five

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,760
thousand kilometers of drainage I'm

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,100
sorry over two hundred sixty five

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,790
kilometers of drainage nearly a milli

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,560
million building footprints over 2,000

00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,150
kilometers of roads and put more than

00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,630
three million people on to the map and

00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,730
with this data covered a huge huge

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,890
portion of the city of darussalam and

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:09,850
this data can now be used for tracking

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:11,770
and measuring against goal 11 so goal 15

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,660
this this focuses on the environments

00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,829
it's called life on land so ensuring

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,410
that the conservation and restoration

00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:19,329
and sustainable use of terrestrial data

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,370
of terrestrial and inland freshwater

00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:23,800
ecosystems in their services in

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:27,209
particular forests wetlands mountains

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,889
and dry lands and this focus is on

00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:31,600
deforestation to a large part and one of

00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:34,779
the indicators is forest area as a

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,220
percentage of total land area this is

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:39,790
something that many of you are already

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:42,040
mapping in osm and so osm data also

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,899
combined with earth observation data can

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:48,759
help immensely with many of the goals as

00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:51,759
well so one thing that we're beginning

00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,230
to see is less and less of a separation

00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,050
between what's considered authoritative

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:58,420
data or government data and data that's

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,220
generated by the crowd and so I'm just

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,899
showing you one one single example

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,350
there's many many examples of this from

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:07,899
around the world in Malawi this is the

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,509
Malawi giono or the spatial data portal

00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:13,839
and it has direct feeds from open street

00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:15,970
map and this is used by on the

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,040
Department of surveys and as well as

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,079
Malawi's National Statistics Office so

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,880
the data that's being collected in osm

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,480
is now being used for official planning

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,730
and monitoring of the goals as well so

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,050
that's lots of positive lots of

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,670
possibilities there but not everything

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:34,000
is a good fit so as you look through

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,829
those 230 indicators there's many things

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,899
that deal with measuring attitudes

00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:39,550
behaviors experiences opinions

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,370
consumption habits these are things that

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,630
we can obviously not or osm is really

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,970
not a good fit for these things it

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,490
requires more of a household survey so

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,050
just to keep in mind some things may be

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,149
a good fit especially around the

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,829
proportion of population type indicators

00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:59,139
but not everything would be a good fit

00:14:55,829 --> 00:15:01,420
so up until now I focus really heavily

00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,860
on the monitoring side of things in the

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,949
data side of things but that's not the

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:09,100
only reason we're doing this really

00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:10,600
we're doing this because data is only

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,709
meaningful when it's used to improve

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:17,110
people's lives and so in addition to

00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:19,540
data being used for monitoring it's also

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,300
being used for on more data-driven

00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:25,329
decision-making by government thank you

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,490
bye-bye government decision makers and

00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:29,889
for more equitable basic services like

00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,199
access to education health safe drinking

00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:34,240
water

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,639
but it's also making possible new forms

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,399
of a direct citizen actions so things

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,350
like if we know where people are living

00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,480
in slums are informal settlements it can

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,060
also be used as a powerful advocacy tool

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,399
in that these communities now exist on

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,810
the map for the very first time can also

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,970
be used for innovation and

00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,519
entrepreneurship so new apps and jet and

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,310
businesses that are using data that's

00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:59,139
been collected in osm and those that

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,829
also directly contributes to some of the

00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:04,570
goals around economic growth so the

00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:06,279
process of mapping and learning to map

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:09,220
is equally important as the end product

00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,930
and it really empowers young people to

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,510
use their skills for a positive social

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:16,660
change becoming more aware of their

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:19,389
communities using the data for advocacy

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:24,010
to improve their communities in learning

00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:26,740
valuable technology skills goal number 5

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:31,060
talks directly about that so using

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,589
technology in particular icts to promote

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:37,029
the empowerment of women this is one of

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:39,310
our mappers in dar Salam so I'll leave

00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,750
you today with five ideas on how you can

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,220
help some of these might be applicable

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,970
to you some of them might not be but

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:48,430
just food for thought um as you carry

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,290
out mapping projects in your countries

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,089
and there's many of you here from around

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,279
the world today think about how you can

00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:57,069
align those projects with the global

00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,959
goals or the SDGs and help to promote

00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:01,569
promote it in that way it's a good thing

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,310
and it helps to get openstreetmap more

00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:06,790
recognition for the valuable work that

00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,919
it's contributing you can also work on

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,870
sector or SD g or sector-specific

00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,730
tagging standards so there's a number of

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:15,309
them out there there's humanitarian osm

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:18,579
tags there's proposed tags around water

00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:20,640
and sanitation and hygiene wash health

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,470
there's a health care to point oh

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,309
there's also proposed tagging around

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:28,990
financial infrastructure as well so I

00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:30,309
urge you to take a look at these if

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,780
you're not familiar with them already

00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:34,240
and think about how we can improve them

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,440
and help to standardize them so that we

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,980
have a common way to talk about our

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,470
achievements and analyze our progress

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,580
other ways you can do that are with on

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,060
standardized survey applications like

00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,270
open map kit

00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,950
support young mappers in your country

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,690
especially many of them sort of

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,340
congregate and universities and around

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,560
Civic tech hubs so these are really

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:57,830
important to be supporting and in

00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:00,050
working in conjunction with you can

00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,520
participate in what's called the global

00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:05,240
partnership for sustainable development

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,700
data so hot has made a commitment to the

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,470
global partnership many of you today

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,820
here today work for organizations that

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,320
have also made commitments if your

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,690
organization has not made a commitment

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,030
around data I'd encourage you to go to

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,550
the website its data for SDGs org and

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,710
think about how the work you're doing

00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:26,840
might be able to contribute to the goals

00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:28,880
as well and finally help government

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,590
decision makers to better use osm data

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,450
so a lot of times our community is

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,090
really good at gathering data generating

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,400
data getting it into osm but then

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:40,310
helping people to actually get it back

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,140
out of osm and use it for analysis I

00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:44,510
think there's lots of room to improve

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,130
their so one of the tools that my

00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,770
colleague Cristiano showed yesterday was

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,080
osm analytics this is one tool that can

00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:53,990
be that can help but I think we have a

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,910
long way to go and there's lots of lots

00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:59,630
of work that we can do to improve this

00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:03,440
tool and also help provide training and

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:05,840
builds new analysis tools that you that

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,060
help to use osm data in conjunction with

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,480
other sources to better measure the

00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:13,550
goals all right and then so this is a

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,020
bonus this is number six if you didn't

00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,900
like any of those number one through

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:21,350
five this is the i like the little badge

00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,560
they had on here sofa superstar so many

00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,120
of you as mappers like to do the

00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,230
comfortable position so if you go to

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,760
this website it gives you some other

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,950
ideas in the things you can do in

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,930
addition to mapping from home without

00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,580
much effort to contribute to the goals

00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,580
so thanks very much I'll end it there

00:19:54,929 --> 00:20:00,250
look my name is Alessandra Liza I do

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:04,809
work for a statistical National

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:06,520
Statistical Office so my question is is

00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:08,350
about the collaboration and partnership

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,289
between openstreetmap and national

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:14,200
statistical offices because we are

00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:19,000
starting a project using openstreetmap

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,070
but the challenge has been to to talk to

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,710
the community in the sense that it is

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:26,650
quite difficult for an organization with

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,679
a hierarchy abstractor to partner with

00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:34,450
that community and we were not we

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:37,179
haven't learned how the process proper

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,520
process to follow so do you have any

00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:41,470
experience this type of collaboration

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,299
that may have happened between

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,200
openstreetmap and National Statistical

00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:49,950
Office and how this partnership can be

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,210
stimulated announced improved thank you

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:56,950
yeah thanks very much for the question

00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,990
so there's two two ways in two concrete

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,659
ways I'd say number one is our

00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,880
organization hot is directly working in

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:06,340
many countries in every place that we're

00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,900
working it's not in isolation we're

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,940
always working in conjunction with

00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,470
government ministries whether it's

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,840
national statistical office or the

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,360
National mapping agency or other

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,100
authorities so we're very happy to I

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,380
mean we're happy to talk to you after

00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,440
about how we can support and provide

00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,510
some ideas the second thing is there's

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,780
going to be what's called if I go back a

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,669
few slides there's these data for SDGs

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,190
road maps that are happening in many

00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:36,220
countries which talk about okay it's

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:39,010
basically a collective brainstorming and

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,960
session where the National Statistical

00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:44,260
agencies are coming together with other

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,390
agencies in the country and nonprofit

00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,600
partners like hot and others to think

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,830
about what data is available and how do

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,530
we get to a place where we can actually

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,790
measure the goals so you can

00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,460
if you're i'm not sure what country

00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,560
you're coming from but you can also

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,930
participate in those workshops in those

00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,950
road maps and that's one way that

00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,750
government agencies are collaborating

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:10,810
with others outside of government as

00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:12,850
well so thanks good morning I'm from

00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,980
Cairo and we create data but we're not

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,570
the National Statistics Office and my

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,010
question is how do I get government to

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,830
actually believe in the data that we

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:22,270
create because they want to believe the

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:26,170
National Ethics office but not the one

00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:27,310
created by third parties so it's a

00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,990
really challenging question without

00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,700
knowing more about the context I think

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,620
in each country it's a very very

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,020
different situation in some countries we

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,580
have very very close collaborations and

00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,750
government is relying on some of the

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,140
data that we're collecting in other

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,670
places it's a it's a process it's a you

00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,880
know it may take months or even years to

00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:48,280
kind of build that relationship so I

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,490
would again point you towards the data

00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,460
for SDGs website and because it's it's a

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,960
really good way for nonprofits to engage

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,160
with governments and figure out what

00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,810
workshops are happening at the

00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,480
government level and so that that's a

00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,160
probably a starting point and also

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,060
participate in those roadmap workshops

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:11,170
in in the countries where you're working

00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:13,390
so if I'm a compliment that answer we've

00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,720
in Kosovo we've had we started working

00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:19,630
with sdg goals and data and we started

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,080
working with mdg data in terms of

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:25,090
analysis of conclusion leading towards

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,430
STD analysis and data collection and

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,410
what we found is it's very difficult to

00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,270
work with government yes in order to

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,910
validate the data that we analyze or

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:36,820
validly analysts we have but every

00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:39,160
region or country has UNDP offices that

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,620
government does listen to so we always

00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,710
work with those UNDP offices or regional

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,650
offices to work with them and produce

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,390
something and then they use it to

00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:52,570
interact and talk with government so

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:58,570
that model or that that intermediary has

00:23:52,570 --> 00:24:01,200
been very successful for us also adding

00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,220
to that question I indication of Mexico

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,650
we have been like community of

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,909
openstreetmap reviewing also that

00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,229
already released

00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:10,299
we have found that there are data sets

00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:13,029
with really good quality that can be a

00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:14,409
measure 44 the goals but subtler that I

00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:16,359
said that they don't have the quality

00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:18,879
that we consider you will be like at

00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:21,639
least confident that you are measuring

00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:24,399
something so we came back with a

00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:27,039
government saying what that we consider

00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:28,509
should be like removal maybe improve and

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,729
they're really open to hear suggestions

00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:32,080
because they need were eyes like us for

00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:33,970
we kind of an inspector because

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,619
sometimes inside me was afraid to like

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:41,849
raise their hands and we don't have

00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:41,849
nothing to lose yeah thank you both

00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:52,389
thanks for the presentation Tyler I have

00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:54,519
more of a comment just on I think I hear

00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:55,239
to action points and I'd like some of

00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,039
the people in the OpenStreetMap

00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:59,559
community to let me know if this already

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,330
exists I don't know but what I heard was

00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:04,539
I need talking points as a government

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:07,779
person to how do I engage with us a tiny

00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:09,369
talking points as an advocate on how to

00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:12,519
do this and so I know that sunlight

00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:13,960
foundation and I feel that sentence

00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,139
every time that word every time I say it

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,210
created a how-to had had a had his open

00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:21,429
data win conversation like talking

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,619
points they created a document on that I

00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:24,759
thought that was really helpful and I

00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:27,489
use that when I was talking with

00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:30,190
governments but if there are wiki pages

00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:31,929
or web pages or guidelines on how to do

00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,059
those things that I think that would be

00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:36,489
useful if it exists great please let us

00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:37,720
know Thank You Heather thanks for that

00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:39,609
i'll just add one comment so

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,349
humanitarian OpenStreetMap team in

00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:43,539
partnership with a few other

00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:46,899
organizations with matte box the u.s.

00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:48,639
Peace Corps GF drr has just is in the

00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:50,889
process of releasing it should be online

00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:54,039
soon if you go to the data as data for

00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:56,710
SDGs org website a guide for how

00:25:54,039 --> 00:26:00,159
governments can work with civil society

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,960
and open data communities so this has

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,729
practical step-by-step tips and

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,559
techniques that we've learned over the

00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:09,509
past few years on how this can actually

00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,509
