In early 2016, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) made a commitment to the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data. As part of this process, HOT mapped the work of the global OSM community to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Incredibly, (or perhaps not so surprisingly), it was found that the global OSM community is contributing to nearly all of the goals.

This talk aims to raise awareness of the many ways that OSM data, and also the process by which it is generated, are contributing to a more equitable world. From measuring financial inclusion in Uganda (Goal 1: No Poverty), to providing vocational training and jobs (Goal 4: Quality Education), to mapping housing conditions and access to basic services in informal settlements (Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities), OSM is front and centre in each of these projects.
