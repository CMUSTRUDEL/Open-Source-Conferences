is led by Christian PA M&Ms boo boon and

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:12,929
it's about the translation workflow

00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:14,460
within the Debian project so Christian

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,320
is and lots and lots of work within

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,060
Debian translation needs someone who

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,580
you'd be working with if you're helping

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,650
out on translation stuff so Christian

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:33,649
thank you

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:37,489
Thank You Daniel do you hear me don't

00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:42,120
Sevilla said presentation on francais a

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:45,090
play-in presentation on espanol Yvonne

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:50,730
in presentation past if I know securely

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:56,610
on italiano you have 10 seconds to run

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:59,309
out of this room of course I do this

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:04,070
presentation in English I can't do it in

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:06,630
Spanish so I do it in broken English

00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:10,189
much more easier to understand I guess

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,600
so as daniel said I'm involved in

00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:15,350
localization and translation and all

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,020
that kind of stuff in debian for about

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:22,229
ten years it's 11 years since I'm a

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,200
Debian developer I do not only do that

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:29,549
in Debian I also maintain packages so

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,000
even if you are labeled as a translator

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,750
you can still maintain packages I used

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,650
to define myself as a non-technical

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:44,159
Debian developer which means if you are

00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:48,060
non-technical guy or lady you can still

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:52,079
maintain packages so this will be about

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,479
a of tutorial doing a tutorial in 45

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,350
minutes feels really difficult so I go

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,290
into a few points just to give you an ID

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,439
and a picture some parts of this

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,140
tutorial funnily about the same than

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,929
those Fernando Estrada gave yesterday

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,300
during the Debian day so it's

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:16,090
interesting to see that both the

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:22,660
front view will show you about the same

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:28,930
things so I talk first to talk about

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:30,250
some okay you got it since I move too

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,310
much I talk too much

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,930
I move too much sometimes I drink too

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,760
much too

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,750
whatever I talk about some general stuff

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,700
about localization internationalization

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,760
then I will give you an example of how

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,970
to translate some Def Con templates very

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,790
quickly of course I'll give you an

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:55,810
example of how we what is the process to

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:58,000
translate some webpages and then a final

00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:02,280
summary about all the ideas we saw

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,200
during this talk so but general stuff

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,170
what I need to address in this tutorial

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,840
or the question people might have when

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,500
they want to get involved in Debian and

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,420
want to contribute to localization or

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,090
internationalization what things do we

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:24,270
translate in Debian what kind of

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:28,270
workflow are we using in this work and

00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:32,680
how can i or can you be involved in that

00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:36,190
process what I will not address in this

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,120
talk is how the software or the web or

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:42,150
the wiki or whatever it is is

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,550
internationalized is made translatable I

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,520
will not address the question by why is

00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:52,870
the information so jerky and you will

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:55,000
see that and I will not answer what is

00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:03,070
your favorite color because the answer

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:06,160
of course is red no blue so let's a few

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:10,739
reminders finally Fernando did exactly

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:13,810
the same yesterday so what we call

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,470
internationalization now after 10 years

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,850
I can say it without problems

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:22,900
internationalization is the action to

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:25,960
make software or something else usable

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,710
and ready to work in different language

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,060
in the

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,979
in countries and what we call

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,380
localization which which shortened at L

00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:38,770
10 and because there are 10 letters

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:42,250
between the L and the N it's the action

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:45,460
of translating software or something

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:48,389
else and documentation to different

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:55,300
languages so you will see very often

00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:59,470
i18n l tenon everywhere what do we

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,990
translate in debian many things here

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,020
again Fernando yesterday made exactly

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:08,860
the same slides there are about the same

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:11,680
things the most important things we

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:17,050
translate are Debian native software

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,539
such as package apt aptitude many others

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,900
all those software we only have in

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:25,930
Debian the packages interaction with

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,300
users such as debconf templates the

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,430
question that are asked when you install

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,159
a package

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:36,130
what is the root password

00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:39,460
what is the directory you want to work

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:42,789
on etcetera etcetera the installer also

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,400
is package interaction with user it ask

00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:48,669
questions you need to read them in your

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:53,199
language the website is of course one

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:55,650
very important item for translators many

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,750
things like DB news press releases

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:01,630
announcements security announcements and

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:04,960
thing like that package descriptions a

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:08,080
very important item all packages of

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,990
description liked one two three

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,090
paragraph for each packages package I

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,180
don't know how many package we have I

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,849
lost account but imagine like 30

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:22,990
thousand packages and many many words

00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:25,659
it's a giant work all Debian specific

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:28,389
documentation such as developer

00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:30,729
documentation or administration

00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,360
documentation and things like that and

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:37,510
what are some important things that

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,340
appeared recently books many probably

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,580
know about the Debian admission

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,040
tuition handbook written by Raphael sock

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,290
and Allah mas finally the French

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,419
translator at this moment we don't work

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,180
on it because it was published initially

00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:54,460
in French but some teams like the

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,240
Spanish team are working to translate it

00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:03,479
also and probably many other items I

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:06,699
forget what we do not translate is

00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:10,120
upstream software upstream software is

00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:13,270
software we using in our desktops like

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:17,290
LibreOffice no more whatever no

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:22,300
translator in Debian works on that this

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:25,270
is done in their respective upstream we

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,070
do not translate wiki pages it may

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,940
surprise some of you because you have

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:33,039
seen translated wiki pages but my and

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,950
this is an opinion of mine currently

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,770
this is not reliable enough on wiki that

00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:41,889
the underdog because you have no way to

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:45,639
know if a translation is up-to-date with

00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:48,400
respect to its original so in my opinion

00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,430
at this moment we have 1/2 times

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,580
translating the wiki and we do not

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:58,360
translate derivative distributions this

00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:01,240
is also a stance of mine I'm always on

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,550
often contacted by users of some

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,820
derivative distribution you know what I

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,830
mean we want to translate it to their

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,889
language I'm fine with that

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,130
if these people on the other hand come

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,840
at me just because they want the other

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,630
distribution to be translated and are

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:23,320
not interested in to Debian itself

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:27,460
I usually noticed that they vanished of

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:29,860
the humans so which is why I say we do

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,339
not directly translate the relative

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,860
distribution indeed we do the installer

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:41,200
of Debian is used for instance in part

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:46,000
of Ubuntu let's have an overview about

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,210
the translation workflow now I do a step

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,430
by step

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,440
well first someone wants you to

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,050
translate something in Debian has to

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,110
find what to translate this is the

00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:03,290
translator work so we'll see in the next

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:05,209
slides how to find what to work on the

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,550
translator also needs to find what to

00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:09,620
work with

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:13,459
you'll see that translation is not a

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:17,390
work you are doing alone so this is a

00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:19,520
translator and teamwork of course you

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,580
have to translate that's the job of the

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,620
translator it's usually one person doing

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,170
that

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,990
very important translation has to be

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:32,899
reviewed even if you're the best

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,839
translator ever you're always doing

00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:38,720
mistakes error grammar errors whatever

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,339
it has to be reviewed this is teamwork

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,779
teamwork is very important

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:48,790
a translation has to be applied either

00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:53,029
applied by a maintainer in a package or

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:57,950
by a translator in VCS for the website

00:09:53,029 --> 00:10:02,450
or whatever it is sometimes it happens

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:06,560
that it's not applied and then some ITN

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:09,560
exterminators come and call for what we

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,990
call an amuse I'm think I'm known for

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,110
doing that because we want our work to

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:19,670
be used sometimes it's not used or not

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:22,070
used fast enough this is about the big

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:26,120
picture and it works for each kind of

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:29,060
translation in Debian so well let's

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,540
enter the our quest or magic quest which

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:34,910
is reaching the famous 100% everything

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:39,560
translated I don't want to see a word of

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:42,320
English in this system so what how to

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,480
find something to translate this is

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,279
where the presentation becomes tricky

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,230
because I have to juggle between two

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:53,329
things if we want to translate some

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,600
programs or debconf what we have in

00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:58,940
debian our status pages so I'm supposed

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,650
to click and then do that and it's

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,130
supposed to work it's working

00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:06,760
here we see the status of templates that

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,920
come templates translation in Spanish

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,710
this is a very complicated page very

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,050
detailed page I go into some of these

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,720
details of course but is this a starting

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,550
point for people who want to work on Deb

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:25,040
calm translation and we have the same

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:27,380
for the programs if you want to

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,090
translate the Debian installer there is

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:35,300
a specific status page which is here it

00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:38,000
looks differently it doesn't have the

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:42,170
website look and feel I'm sorry for that

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,760
it's done on another place and it has

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:51,440
the full detail status it has links to

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:53,420
documentation etc etc if you want to

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,720
translate the website there is a

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,600
specific status page for the website it

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,410
looks a little bit differently again

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:06,320
this is the website status for Spanish

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:09,290
you see how many files are translated

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,490
how many not translated what is out

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,530
digit etc I'll come back on that if you

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,980
want to translate the Debian news or

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:21,440
some announcements there is no central

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,830
site announcements and call for

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:29,540
translations happen in the general IIT

00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:33,350
nine mailing list for instance this is a

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:39,380
call made by one of the editors of the

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:44,540
Debian project news to translate 2010

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:47,690
slash 12/12 and and people can click and

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,990
whatever they want to do and get the

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:53,570
material to translate oh the mailing

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:56,900
list for your specific language there

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,690
are calls in this mailing list also for

00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,910
instance I pointed to a call for

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:08,330
translation of the Debian handbook in

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:11,650
the Spanish localization mailing list if

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:14,950
you want to translate the back

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:18,700
description there is nice things name de

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:21,370
de TSS which means Debian description

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:24,880
translation system and I don't know what

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:27,930
this final s means it's a web interface

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,640
to a thing that's called the DD GP

00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:34,180
project to translate all descriptions

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:37,510
it's a little bit slower because it runs

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:41,650
on the machines lost in Extremadura in

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:43,990
Spain which is quite slow and there you

00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,240
can work on Spanish translation of

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,880
package description I won't show that

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,870
this is quite a complicated project this

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,480
is on all done on a web and this is the

00:13:52,870 --> 00:14:01,089
only translation effort that's done on

00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:04,300
the web in Debian you see many many

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:08,680
different places many different starting

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:12,570
points so let's take an example an

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,570
example of one of the most

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:19,830
straightforward process translate some

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:24,390
debconf templates for a given package

00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:28,570
so let's translate something to Spanish

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:30,370
Spanish is actually not 100% for their

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,970
confident place this is the team goal

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,860
they will reach that goal I know that

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:38,080
but there are a few bits here and there

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,940
that still needs to be done so let's

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:45,459
pick two ok go to the Status page and

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,770
here we go we are to the Status page so

00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:50,850
this is the same page as I showed you

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:53,589
see many blah blah blah and then

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:56,080
packages with P odep comm support and

00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:59,100
for which translation is to do wrong

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:02,380
section main ho these Tomo your tools

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,290
not translated yeah I will jump on that

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:12,820
yeah the kiamana will be happy because

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:15,790
it is his package and no I would like to

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,630
translate this to me oh don't stop now

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:21,850
don't jump on it because what you need

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,740
to do is to check if somebody is doing

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:27,570
it

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:30,120
so the source for information for is the

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,890
Debian Alton and Spanish mailing list we

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,190
because I wanted to translate to Spanish

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:39,570
and its coordination page yes

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:44,730
another Status page yes another place to

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:47,550
look at so this kind of things which is

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,650
quite well known by people working for a

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:55,140
long time in translation work show you

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:57,570
the effort of translation by the debian

00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:00,810
Alton and Spanish and basically what I

00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:03,120
should do is to try to find tomoyo tools

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:07,950
so let's try to find

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,900
tomoyo tools tomo yo tomo yo tomo yo i

00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:13,050
said to move your linux because someone

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:16,290
probably made a mistake somewhere so

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:20,280
there's something and we are in section

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,790
what it is ITT okay I don't know what it

00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,670
means

00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:26,070
it seems that someone named cristiano

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:29,040
per year is working on it which is

00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:33,030
strange there's a link and this link

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,670
says okay I intended to instead but

00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:39,300
ignore this man this is meant for this

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:41,670
talk so apparently there was someone

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:47,070
wanting to work on it it should not

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:49,170
start working on it of course I need

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:54,030
someone to really do the work because I

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:56,730
won't do the work I repeat don't start

00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,910
immediately interact and use the mailing

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:02,730
list that's really important so this

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,580
translation workflow seems complicated

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,709
in indeed it's really simple I will

00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,770
maybe have to move across the line I

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:14,790
don't know it's always thought by

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:17,400
something we call translation to do DAF

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:20,100
it's the riff from French because many

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,260
of these processes have been set by the

00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:25,980
French team so DAF means

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:30,360
traduction affair with mean translation

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:34,620
to do so someone sends okay tough Tomoyo

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,590
tools then someone sends an intent to

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,850
translate I want

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:44,330
- in translate so it's kind of

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:46,490
reservation of the work then the person

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,249
works on it and at some point has

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:53,499
something ready and sends a request for

00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:57,080
review and we enter some kind of a loop

00:17:53,499 --> 00:18:01,279
review some reviewers send comments

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:03,799
changes etc another review etc and at

00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:07,669
some point the original translator

00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:11,119
thinks ok that seems to be ready I send

00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:16,129
the last change for comments may still

00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:20,029
to the mailing list and once done after

00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:21,889
some time I send a bug report this is a

00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:24,230
DEP comp template for package

00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:27,499
substantiation should be sent as a bug

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:30,169
report and then at some point the

00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:34,639
maintainer uploads the package fixes the

00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:37,730
bug and the translation is done and if

00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:40,190
there are changes we go back to starting

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:44,389
point and we go again and again and

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:49,009
again seems complicated actually it's

00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:52,249
used by about 10 different teams

00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:54,830
including those things that are only one

00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:57,679
single person or one or two single

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:02,720
person because it's helps tracking the

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:05,179
work so let's really start now we are

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,779
the wing I said hi didi yes I will

00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:13,100
translate tomorrow so I sent my ITT mail

00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:16,690
so let's go I sent my mail I don't know

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:20,869
other Spanish translator we work on that

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:23,539
and I need to get the translation

00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:27,529
material of course so I'm back to the

00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:36,679
status pages where I was or I try to go

00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:39,470
there ok I click here I get a list ok so

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,749
I have to know this is here that I have

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,600
to click because if I click there that

00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:46,039
won't work I go to the BTS if I click

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,990
there I have something completely

00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:57,600
useless and this is what I need

00:19:48,990 --> 00:20:05,460
I get a file I saved a file somewhere in

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:11,640
my TMP directory and then okay I go to

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:15,660
TMP is that big enough it's not visible

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:23,250
enough okay I unzip because the fire was

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:26,610
zipped and we have a bug on the current

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:30,390
server so actually the files are zipped

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:34,559
twice just to be sure they are very very

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:40,170
very compressed now that's a bug and I

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:42,660
unzip again I rename this file as es dot

00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,679
pure because I work for Spanish

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:48,360
translation

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:51,840
so stop that's you I get the purify I

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:56,490
put in a work directory I personally use

00:20:51,840 --> 00:21:00,750
a directory for each package I unzip I

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:03,690
renamed as yes dot P o sv dot p o if I'm

00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:07,679
a Swedish translator or f @p or whatever

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:12,150
I never use country modificators no es

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:15,179
underscore and E for Nicaragua or

00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:18,870
whatever never particularly for Deb

00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:20,010
confident plates so I have a purify what

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:25,970
is a pure file

00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:31,290
this is this kind of well using VI it's

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:33,780
okay it has a header some things that

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,910
say okay the last translator is this

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,750
person language team dead person rah

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:42,360
blah blah and messages to translate I

00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:46,590
can do my work in VI I can type in VI

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:49,260
okay I'm a VIII wizard I but I can make

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:53,940
mistakes in VI it's very easy to make

00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:57,630
mistakes in VI in Emacs - ok so that

00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:01,050
will not be my recommendation I prefer

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:03,059
recommending using dedicated tool there

00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:07,259
are many I pick

00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:12,269
examples localized most often used by KD

00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:14,789
users pure edit is a gtk based Pio

00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:17,429
editor G translator I'm not really sure

00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:21,320
if it's still well-maintained all the

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:24,899
VIP or mode the one I was using I

00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,779
recommend to properly configure the tool

00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:30,029
because needs some information and this

00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:39,179
information is particularly important

00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:41,850
let's see that with localize for you

00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:44,759
specially I made my kiddie environments

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:47,429
speaking English so you're happy so the

00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,960
most important part is to configure it

00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:53,820
to configure your name the email address

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,059
well the default language is currently

00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:00,509
American English because KD is currently

00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:06,990
configured in English the mailing list

00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:09,049
of my team and the localized name of the

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,850
team these information are very

00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:14,340
important because these are go to the

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:17,519
headers of the pure file so this is the

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,799
way someone wanting to warn you that

00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,919
there is an update need it will send

00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:26,549
mails so please take care to configure

00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:29,220
this very carefully then what we have in

00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:32,249
such an editor is pretty obvious I have

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,970
the original message at the top enabled

00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:39,149
Tomoyo Linux in boot time and here I can

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:42,289
type my translation what's nice with

00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:46,100
such tools they have something named

00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:50,700
translation memory for instance I

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:55,559
translated something named cue SMTP D

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:58,710
which has a similar question and here I

00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:03,360
can pick the translation of Q SMTP D

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:05,129
with control one and then I see okay 40

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,179
lucky it's in French of course I cannot

00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:11,549
translate to Spanish I tried that was a

00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:15,779
first time for this talk but I won't

00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:18,359
insist so I just have to do this

00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,309
because translation memory helps me in

00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:23,429
that confident place it's very useful

00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:26,999
because the message are always more or

00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:30,330
less the same and therefore you have a

00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:32,729
consistent style in your translation so

00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:38,099
this is why I recommend to use such

00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:40,979
tools and probably less VI or standard

00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:43,619
editors because of such facilities you

00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:46,739
can also inject in such tools some

00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:49,409
Campania some already translated

00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:54,479
sentences it's also very useful there

00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:58,109
are many many dozens of useful tricks so

00:24:54,479 --> 00:25:05,789
use dedicated tool please

00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:08,669
I recommend that this God okay so I

00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:11,609
won't do the entire process otherwise

00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:15,239
Zack will hate me because I will be late

00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:18,179
and Daniel is picking his sign so how I

00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:23,149
should hurry let's see how the entire

00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:25,950
workflow works I supposedly have

00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:29,369
somewhere the workflow yeah

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:32,539
so what happens is someone sends the

00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:36,479
mail to the mailing list and say okay

00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:40,589
here for postfix there is something

00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:43,349
needed I usually do that for many teams

00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:46,169
on behalf of maintainer it can be the

00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:49,379
maintainer it's automated because in the

00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:53,489
PIO file the the header says language

00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:57,179
team for these languages that address so

00:25:53,489 --> 00:25:59,669
for Spanish ok Francisco was the

00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,859
original translator and the debian elton

00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:06,659
and spanish team is the language team so

00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:13,440
they get the mail later on Matias sends

00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:18,719
an ITT ok he says nothing ITT apparently

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:22,249
it's not needed to say more then he

00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:27,089
works a little bit and sense Arif a

00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:29,430
request for review and he says ok there

00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:36,240
was only one string to modify

00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:39,120
I and sends well he chose to show the

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,820
string that was modified which is a

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,210
choice and then he attached the entire

00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:49,220
translation and then a few other

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:54,120
commented I don't know what they said

00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:58,340
well partly use of adverbs or whatever

00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:02,850
it is and at some point he sent Elsie

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:05,640
fc+ chains for comments and you see this

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,830
loop in the mailing list archive it

00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,140
works very well and particularly in

00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:15,180
teams where there are several computer

00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:18,360
contributors so intent request for

00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:21,090
review suggestions last change for

00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,780
comments and after enough time I put

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:28,070
quotes because it depends you just need

00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:32,430
to feel it's usually a few days then

00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:35,960
translator sends a bug report and Matias

00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:39,330
here reported a bug against postfix

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:42,540
using the standard Debian report bug

00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:45,360
report tools I want to go into details

00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:48,630
here again but reportbug' are such kind

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,930
of tools can be used and then please

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:55,680
find attached spanish updated we have

00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:58,740
some conventions that these bugs are

00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:02,070
always severity wishlist and they have

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:05,010
tags l tenon and patch because you send

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:07,650
a translation that's a patch it's

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:13,470
important because it's more visible for

00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:16,680
maintenance and after some really

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:21,030
completely unknown time the maintainer

00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:24,750
updates when he or she feels the need

00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:27,870
sometimes it takes edges and sometimes

00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:30,420
someone is bored of waiting and the

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:33,570
sands and non maintainer upload of

00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:36,650
course by interacting with the maintain

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:39,570
the original maintainer which will

00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,640
actually happen very soon for Pacific's

00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,020
because i'm waiting for a very long time

00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:48,110
for

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:53,390
updates since April as you see that was

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:55,400
one example but let's take another

00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,679
example a little bit shorter because

00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,500
you'd see it's the same process but

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,530
different kind of translation it let's

00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:06,200
talk about a web page translation to be

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:09,710
honnest web page translation is not

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,660
something I do very often so I learned a

00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,170
little bit beforehand with my friend

00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:17,780
David who is sitting around there and

00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:20,900
who is the wizard of the French

00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:25,309
translation of web pages as well as the

00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:27,940
wizard of the Debian web sites so this

00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:32,570
is completely different

00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:37,490
the web site isn't using Pio file isn't

00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:40,190
using get text the web site uses wml

00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:42,410
files so you have the original English

00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:46,030
and the translation is the same one but

00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:51,830
with Spanish or French or whatever words

00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:54,440
it has no fancy VCS it will probably be

00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:58,130
the very very last bit of Debian that

00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:01,100
uses CVS and they are very good reason

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:05,360
for that I have been explained about

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:07,670
these reasons and many many automated

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,309
mechanisms are working like that so it

00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:12,559
seems a little bit old old-style tools

00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:16,150
but it's working actually and working

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:20,900
very efficiently so how it's working

00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:24,350
more or less the web site requires to

00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:27,020
have a kind of coordinator I use this

00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:29,960
word with quotes coordinator is someone

00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:33,800
who really works who monitors things

00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:36,260
very often very carefully on a date by

00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:39,890
day basis there can be more than one

00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:42,830
coordinator per language team one doing

00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:45,200
the website another survey the PIO depth

00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:48,020
count for stuff another the Installer

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,330
etcetera I don't think it's a very good

00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:54,440
thing to have one that does everything

00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:55,770
it's not humanly possible actually this

00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,280
is the way we

00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:01,830
or to organize the French team this

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,130
coordinator for the website needs to

00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:09,960
have commit rights it helps a lot it's

00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:13,620
not mandatory but it helps a lot and he

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,960
or she can dispatch or prioritize the

00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,480
work of course there are some pages that

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,559
are more important to translate than

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,840
some user pages I discovered that we

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,360
have some pages on the website where

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,750
some users describe how they are using

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,110
Debian some are 10 years old or

00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:36,720
something I guess and some of them are

00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:39,750
translated so people were translating

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:45,030
this it's fun this is the same process

00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:47,190
TAF translation to do ITT RFR at CFC and

00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:50,520
at the end of course there is no bug

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:52,530
report you cannot easily I guess you can

00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,530
maybe send a bug report against the

00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:58,050
website and someone in the web team will

00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:01,650
commit but imagine if they have to do

00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:05,190
this for each translation file and each

00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:08,190
language and then send the dawn message

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:11,400
still to the mailing list because this

00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:15,020
mailing list is processed every day to

00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:21,990
produce the status pages you have seen

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:24,770
so let's see the web Status pages it

00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:27,900
shows this one I chose the French

00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:32,130
translations because we worked a little

00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:36,120
bit with the vid to prepare this so we

00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:42,090
have here a file debian accessibility

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:43,860
index what reload the page I'm supposed

00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:48,690
to reload the page because there are

00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:53,400
some cache effects somewhere oh thank

00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:55,559
you so it seems complicated indeed it's

00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:59,850
really easy if you click here you see

00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:03,030
the web page if you click it there you

00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:05,730
will see the diff between the version

00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:08,640
that is translated and the new version

00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,240
this page is outdated the French version

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,210
is

00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,810
is on version one point ten while the

00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:19,260
conversion is one point eleven even you

00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:24,330
can stay here there is some JavaScript

00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:26,970
you need JavaScript ha and click and you

00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:29,580
see there is one line at it

00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:33,390
okay host that's an easy stuff I can do

00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:36,870
it easily there are no 12 200,000 lines

00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:42,120
so that's an easy work I can view the

00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:44,970
file the wml file oh I can whatever it

00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,030
is I think I see the CBS log or

00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:52,950
something so let's view the file for

00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:55,350
instance okay this is the file and the

00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:59,040
diff of course applies to this file here

00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:01,350
I think I can download this file so this

00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:06,390
is the place where I click and then I

00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:13,020
get the file to update I'd save it

00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:16,290
yes index okay and but I see this

00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:21,150
gentleman here said okay there is work

00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:23,520
to do to do tough the same thing so he

00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:28,440
probably sent to the mail French mailing

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:32,310
list let's see yeah Daffy wml it's very

00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,710
encoded you does syntax for all this

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:39,480
which says okay this is a tough this is

00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:41,880
for wml style files for develop in

00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,460
accessibility bla bla bla and he says ok

00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:47,010
this is a fake file but he messed up

00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:52,770
this apparently the second one yeah you

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:54,930
made well but that that works so as you

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,390
see if I'm only reading the mailing list

00:34:54,930 --> 00:35:03,210
I say ok there's something to do I go to

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:07,670
the web pages wait probably here yeah

00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:12,330
and I can download which I did and I can

00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:17,700
well I can use here I need to use my

00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:20,100
editor and then I edit the con file it's

00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,770
one point n I need to do the needed

00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,140
changes work with the DEF ad

00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:29,670
what's needed change what's needed etc

00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:32,490
and then I save and I sin and I enter

00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:37,650
again this loop Arif ah

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:41,160
etc etc I won't do that because that

00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:45,600
would be a little bit long but I guess

00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:48,030
you see the point and we enter that loop

00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,190
and at the end the coordinator probably

00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:55,320
David for the French the French team

00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:57,510
will commit the file so it was shortened

00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,020
a little bit but you get the you will

00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:03,840
get the points so after reaching that

00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,570
point in my preparation talk I said what

00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:11,280
did I say in this talk what have these

00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:15,480
people see let's summarize

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,780
we have processes they work they are

00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,780
very rock solid there are work for 10 or

00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:25,310
15 years for some of them the

00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:28,560
information is very very disorganized I

00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:30,960
can say whole how look it's fancy you

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,010
have only one place you click no it's

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,470
completely disorganized it works but

00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:40,950
disorganized we don't have any

00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:43,730
point-and-click translations system some

00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:46,740
website where you just go and you

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:51,330
translate online and whatever you want

00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:53,160
to do you see what I mean so we have

00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,610
some working process in progress to

00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:00,120
automate this most of this start to

00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:04,350
stages etc is based on a work that has

00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:06,840
been done in 2005-2006 in Extremadura on

00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:09,780
a machine that was hosted in Extremadura

00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:12,060
we are currently moving this to i18n the

00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,160
debian the dog an official machine

00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,720
administered by the debian system

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,720
administrators because this

00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,930
infrastructure is very important this is

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,260
where you get the package description

00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:27,690
translation if the stops working there

00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:30,420
are no more translation for the packages

00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:33,380
so we are currently moving that I

00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:36,160
actually some places where I clicked I

00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,589
just so we just switched

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,510
this week during that camp from one

00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:45,819
machine to another we need to centralize

00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:48,880
this information this material source

00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:51,640
and we need something the problem is

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,250
this information is not centralized at

00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,339
all the DEP confident plates they are in

00:37:54,250 --> 00:38:01,270
each and every package some packages use

00:37:57,339 --> 00:38:05,380
get some use SVN some don't use any VCS

00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:07,630
at all the installer is in gates but

00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:11,980
some parts of the Installer is are in as

00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:15,190
we and the website is in CVS etc you see

00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:19,480
the point so that's not completely

00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:21,640
trivial and we need also to lower the

00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,670
entry barrier we know what I described

00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,829
is complicated to learn it takes time

00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:31,299
too many people which means they are we

00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:34,329
have too few teams probably I wanted to

00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:37,720
say that maybe not too much we don't

00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:39,690
want something too easy to enter we

00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,450
don't want something you go on a website

00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:45,549
randomly you are you don't apply any

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,589
process and you start translating in

00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:50,799
random Spanish or random French or

00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:56,309
whatever we still want to keep control

00:38:50,799 --> 00:39:00,579
we want to keep telling the quality and

00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:03,250
my last message the one I added at the

00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:07,690
very end because that can be a good

00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:11,410
transition for Zack translators are 100

00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:13,539
pots hundred percent part of Debian you

00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:17,049
can become a Debian developer if you are

00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:20,619
only a translator we have these status

00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:22,960
of non applauding Debian developer who

00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:25,569
has access to Debian machines which is

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,750
very important for the work of many of

00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:32,650
us you can vote I checked before and I

00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:35,589
wasn't sure but you can be the DPL you

00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:39,609
are no longer second-class citizens in

00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:44,140
some way we only have 5 people like this

00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:46,870
in the overall Libyan out of hundreds of

00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:49,280
Debian developers that's

00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,470
something is going on but this is a

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,570
reason status so I would like to

00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:57,470
encourage those people who contribute

00:39:53,570 --> 00:40:00,290
regularly on translation work to enter

00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:03,710
this process this is not scary this is

00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:07,750
not a such a difficult process and do it

00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:15,200
do it we need that kind of contributors

00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:17,900
also and if you have questions you can

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,480
ask questions if you don't you can look

00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:25,600
at these Nicaraguan landscapes

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,740
hi Christian congratulations for your

00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:32,000
presentation I'd like to very much and

00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:36,820
thank you for have you being clear and I

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:42,160
have the tool in in the pod of comm

00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:47,980
website were the names of the

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:51,680
responsibles the percentage indicators I

00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:56,120
want to ask you if you can explain and

00:40:51,680 --> 00:41:00,290
faster the you want you want me to go

00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:03,560
back to I have now I have many pages

00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:09,160
opened so it will be tricky but I can

00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:12,710
try yeah you mentioned in discord and

00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:15,620
for example the percentage I can I can

00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:16,700
explain this part of course I went only

00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,880
to that part

00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,940
these are untranslated packages packages

00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,180
with completely untranslated pure DEFCON

00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:29,860
templates here we have partially

00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:35,000
translated packages they are read when

00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:37,760
the percentage is very low and up to

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,870
green when the percentage is quite high

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:47,390
the translator name is here you can get

00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:50,720
the file here and the the other name is

00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:53,630
the name of the person who sent the

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,780
request for review so these pages also

00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:58,880
show you where are these packages so if

00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,890
I for instance if I want to pick

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,350
something

00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:05,750
an incomplete package which I would like

00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:08,350
to complete i shouldn't pick something

00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:12,020
that's already done such as these ones

00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:15,170
but maybe i should pick seasonings his

00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:18,440
venus because well there is a translator

00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:21,110
so if i want to pick that i first need

00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,980
to contact that person i shouldn't take

00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:30,520
over a translators work without asking

00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:33,370
him or her if agrees with me taking over

00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:36,680
there are many names but these are the

00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:39,530
responsible and person in charge names i

00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:51,290
hope this ends thank you

00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:54,830
Oh was I so clear and so crystal clear

00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:58,960
my god it's scaring so you were all

00:42:54,830 --> 00:43:01,880
sleeping I'm afraid I didn't notice I

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,940
tried to watch if somebody was trying to

00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,840
killing someone with a sock but I didn't

00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,410
notice anything

00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:11,840
I forgot this would be out of the rules

00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:17,530
if I see someone you're out of the game

00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,530
right any other questions

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,349
hi take care of much for your

00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,050
presentation

00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:35,140
I do translation must for upstream

00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:37,420
projects like Drupal and an order

00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:41,440
projects like Levantine a music player

00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:43,290
that has its translation framework and I

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,390
said on a website called

00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:50,880
transifex I don't know if you know about

00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:54,700
it it's an open source project on both

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:59,170
websites both in Drupal that has its own

00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:01,180
framework and in transifex it's very

00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:03,640
easy to do translation very very easy

00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:07,000
the example that you gave that was a

00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:12,670
point-and-click translation but it's not

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:17,020
that easy to fall in the fear that you

00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:19,869
was expressing that anyone can do

00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:22,000
translation without any quality normally

00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:23,800
you have somebody that needs your

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,820
approval if you are a new person and

00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:31,060
there is a trust system so if you have

00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:35,140
good translations and the people that

00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:37,810
has supervise you give you a good score

00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:41,470
then you can immediately start

00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:43,990
translating it's like a trust system

00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:48,130
it's not like anyone can come and turn

00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:51,430
right whatever so I saw the system is I

00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:55,839
see a working system but it's really

00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:58,450
hard and I I I can see the difficulty

00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:03,190
for a new person to start translating

00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:05,650
for the Debian project so it just my my

00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:07,599
point of view it will be cool to have a

00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:10,210
point-and-click sensation but with a

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,040
trusted system for the translator that

00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:17,260
have come into the project for the first

00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:21,190
time yeah that about having to summarize

00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:24,730
your your suggestion is those frameworks

00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:27,849
translation frameworks indeed in the

00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:30,070
past they were too opened and we know a

00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:33,610
very famous one that

00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:36,640
has been used by Ubuntu and what's in

00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:40,600
the view of many people to open to easy

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,670
to enter no quality as you said it there

00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,520
have been many improvements on in all

00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:48,070
those frameworks the problem we have in

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,410
Debian currently mostly as many things

00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:52,360
in Debian things don't happen just

00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:55,510
because someone wants them to happen

00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:59,440
they happen because someone does the

00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:02,490
work and also the work is very difficult

00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:06,100
because of this very widespread

00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:08,110
information so we are considering that

00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:11,490
we are considering we are not

00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:17,380
considering to use transifex for some

00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:19,780
different reasons and because also it

00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:23,140
probably too much depends on back end

00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:25,240
VCS I guess we are considering to use

00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,760
some things like web blades we were

00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:31,720
considering to use pootle at some time

00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:34,210
but it's not hooked enough into VCS to

00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,960
work with the places where we have good

00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:40,270
VCS integration so we're considering for

00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,760
instance to work more probably with web

00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:44,800
blades also because web laid ultra

00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:48,340
happens to work in the past with Debian

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:53,200
so it's usually it's more useful so

00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:55,930
there is no rule against frameworks just

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,000
needs to happen that needs someone to

00:46:55,930 --> 00:47:01,900
start and we first needed to have a

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,920
rock-solid machine for that and still we

00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:09,550
want to keep this process this control

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,490
it's slow it's clumsy it sounds a little

00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:18,150
bit old to work in meaningless but I can

00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:18,150
tell you it works thank you very much

00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:24,820
thank you Christian in about 15 minutes

00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:29,410
we should have bits from the DPL coming

00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:32,650
