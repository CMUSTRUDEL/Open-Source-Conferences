there we go welcome everyone this is the

00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,189
bits from the DPL with our Debian

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,650
project leader

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,300
Stefan Ozaki Rolly so everybody give a

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,190
round of applause I don't think he needs

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,190
much of an introduction Thanks

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,600
so I'm sure I'm sure you are here

00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,670
because this would be the last time I

00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,040
bother you with stab bits from the DPL

00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:34,450
speech at least calm so thanks for being

00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:38,080
here in this talk I gonna go through two

00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:41,770
main parts so the first one is some sort

00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,559
of a set of mantras that have become the

00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,840
way I define Debian today so I've

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,450
presented them to various people before

00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,950
I see there is enough people in the room

00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,720
that won't be bothered because it's the

00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,280
first time they heard them so I hope you

00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,100
will allow me to go through them and

00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,110
then after this kind of defining mantras

00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,180
of Debian I will present some of the

00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,890
challenges that I think we have in

00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,229
Debian and that we need to take care of

00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,050
to guarantee that we have along a

00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:11,110
healthy life ahead but before that I am

00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,990
trying to make a point that we did make

00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,440
history so this is how they've been

00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:20,950
started in 1993 the first quote okay so

00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,979
1993 is almost 20 years ago back then

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:26,289
there were very few Linux Easterwood no

00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:28,179
university bhushan around and there were

00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:30,610
they had troubles there were the quality

00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:33,190
was not stellar and people started to

00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,990
think about ok how can we make you know

00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,209
Linux competitive with commercial

00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,670
operating system and Ian Murdoch came up

00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:43,630
with this great idea of Debian and this

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,940
were all this started but then we made

00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,940
history at least in two ways so one way

00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,220
is a sort of community and social way so

00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,869
in our more recent interview of a couple

00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,209
of years ago yet made the point that

00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:57,880
Debian has been the first international

00:01:55,209 --> 00:02:00,729
community project so there were

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,619
distributions back then there were free

00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,720
software projects back then but the main

00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:06,130
was kind of designed with community mind

00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,869
and with the idea that if you want

00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,670
something to scale to the side to the

00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:12,880
side of Damien today we need to have a

00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:15,340
community behind it so I think we really

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,500
made the history showing up our project

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,480
as big as Debian can be made only in a

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,240
community driven way but then we also

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,730
made history in very technical ways so

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,920
20 years has passed since 1993

00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,379
and if we look at today Debian we have

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,750
something like almost 40,000 binary

00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,650
packages in Debian proper we have made

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,959
12 release and

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,659
maybe we'll make the 13 before the end

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:43,069
of this year we have a project of almost

00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:44,180
1000 members and almost 200 Debian

00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:45,590
maintenance that have interests in

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,840
maintaining some part of Debian and

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,069
various thousand reso contributors doing

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,890
a lot of other stuff useful for the

00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:54,260
project so we have the largest number of

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,870
ports among let's say major binary

00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,849
distributions of there we have known

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,650
Linux ports so we've released a version

00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,659
of Debian that work with the kernel

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,609
other than Linux we haven't yet released

00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:06,500
a version of Debian that works on a

00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:08,150
kernel like heard but for people who

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,889
like heard and want to try it

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,819
Debian still remains the belt the best

00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:17,299
choice to do that okay so well done this

00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:21,250
is us making this okay so Bravo all of

00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:24,889
you we made this but then one thing is

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,049
making history in some way technically

00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:30,560
or socially and a completely different

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:32,840
thing is remaining relevant so in this

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,519
past three years as DPLA has been faced

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,010
by the problem that people were starting

00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,709
to question and that was like a couple

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,079
of years ago is do we still need Debian

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,250
I mean why okay that you mean history

00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,449
you made a lot of stuff you made

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,180
derivatives you made a lot of stuff but

00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:49,430
do we really still need Debian today so

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,680
I've asked myself how to answer the

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,870
question and a way to answer the

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,090
question is asking us ourselves what's

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,799
different from what we do and what the

00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,470
other distributions do so there are

00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,180
something like 300 400 active free

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,250
software distributions around so what is

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,500
that makes Debian special okay and I've

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,079
started thinking at some answer to that

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,659
question and I've come I came I came to

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,790
welcome to five specific trades that

00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:15,379
makes I think the Debian project unique

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,720
I think it's useful to keep it in mind

00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:19,609
and to remind why we are contributing to

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,520
the Debian and not to some other similar

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:24,919
project so the first reason and it's

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,550
sort of my first montage that makes them

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,940
special

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,729
its freedom okay this seems obvious but

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,500
it's freedom in many ways so the first

00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:36,139
reason why they've in especial in terms

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,030
of freedom is that we essentially have

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,710
agreed with our public and with free

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,240
software public in general to keep

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,130
Debian always free okay

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,570
we have been promoting the culture of a

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,070
software not only giving free software

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,060
to people have been promoting the

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,270
cultural office

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,760
after since 1993 and we have a product

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,560
which is free the bottom up there is an

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,690
incredibly high amount of the dogfooding

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,180
what we do so it is free in the software

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,100
give to people it is free in the way we

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,750
make it every single bit of the Debian

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,150
infrastructure is free and nobody would

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,430
accept if we start making Debian using

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,410
like non free stuff in our

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,780
infrastructure ok this is kind of

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,750
peculiar per se and we have also a

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,180
notion of freeness in the processes we

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,100
use so people who have been around in

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,960
there for quite a while I've heard the

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,340
motto there is no cabal as some sort of

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,100
joke several times

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,930
ok and we use it in saying that in

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,610
thinking that there is some cabal around

00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,139
but the point is that if we make this

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,060
joke it means that we really cannot

00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,040
stand the idea that there is someone

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,229
driving Debian behind the curtain

00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,910
driving Debian not in the open okay so

00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:39,020
we're free not only no infrastructure

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,910
not only in the software we make but

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,450
also in the way we do things we try to

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:46,010
be as transparent as we could be and

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,120
what's more interesting for me is that

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,220
there is some sort of community

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,400
awareness of this kind of attachment we

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,440
have for freedom so our community trusts

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,539
us to not betray software freedom

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,979
principle and I think that this has been

00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,240
a very high contribution to free

00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,430
software in general so we have set some

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,620
sort of very high bar to decide when

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,620
something is free or not ok when the

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,090
when people that need to decide if some

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,680
software is free or if some license

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,660
should be considered free software or no

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,250
or not they go they go basically to

00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,110
three hand it is they go to the Free

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,330
Software Foundation they go to the OSI

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,250
they go to Debian and they see if that

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,620
license is considered free by those

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,600
people and we are one of them ok so

00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,280
first point which i think is determining

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,700
what we do in Debian is freedom software

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,380
it second point is some kind of

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,780
perfectionism which sometimes try to

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,229
back on us ok sometimes make make that

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,510
the trade it gets in the way of some of

00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:41,300
our choices but we do have a sort of

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,030
culture of technical excellence ok we

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,919
have the policy which is where we have

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,990
codified our quality needs for packages

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,700
we have a huge amount of testing of link

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,990
and we have PU parts of testing

00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,270
automatically testing to see that

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,460
packages matches our policy we have

00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,919
maintained errs who are software experts

00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,260
so we do not we try to discourage people

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,889
to maintain software in Debian if they

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,930
only know

00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:05,060
about packaging we try to encourage

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,710
people to maintain software they use and

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,379
software of which they are expert and

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,999
this is huge in terms of user support so

00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:12,319
when I when a user come to us come to

00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:14,960
the respective maintainer some software

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,610
in Debian usually it finds someone that

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,949
knows about that specific piece of soft

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,550
ok this for us is quality we have

00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:23,779
packages which are all at the same they

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,699
are up all to the same quality

00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,840
requirements okay there are no packages

00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,840
there is no distinction the Debian

00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,219
archive that says we try to have these

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,509
quality requirements for one part of the

00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,430
archive and a different one for another

00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,889
part of their guy ok and also when we

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,099
say we released when it's ready it's our

00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:42,620
way to say that we know we cannot commit

00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,539
yet to a specific date because we fear

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,279
finding issues quality issues just

00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:47,960
before that well it's day and we feel

00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,240
compromising our already's quality for

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,529
that specific day so when we say what is

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,500
when it's ready is also a matter of

00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:56,210
quality Third Point and it's something

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,060
important from what I'm going to tell

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:03,139
you next is independence so if you look

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,139
around at the ecosystem of distributions

00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:08,659
out there you won't find mainstay bution

00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,520
where you cannot pinpoint a company that

00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:12,379
is back in the distribution ok among the

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,050
big distribution we are one of the very

00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:17,689
few that is completely run on a

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,729
volunteer basis ok that we have no

00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:22,159
corporate or some sort of hierarchical

00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:24,229
structure that where the decision come

00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:26,300
from top-down ok we have no single

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:28,610
company babysitting us ok and we

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,560
essentially live up to donations in term

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,449
of time so volunteers contributing time

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,969
to Debian and do the difference in term

00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:36,500
of money ok this is very remarkable in

00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,810
the ecosystem of today especially

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,269
inference of the distributions and once

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,699
more we have a phenomenon of community

00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:45,740
awareness our community seems to trust

00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:48,680
that due to this independence of us

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,899
decisions in Debian won't be taken due

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,610
to some profit reason or other kind of

00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:54,769
reason than our own core values

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,480
okay so independence is another very

00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:59,570
important value for me that motivates me

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,260
to contribute to Debian and then we have

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:05,240
decision-making okay so decision making

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,089
it's something that is very well

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,769
codified in our Constitution so the

00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,449
basic rule which has started to call a

00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:13,339
while ago do occur see actually I picked

00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:15,209
it up to stuff for someone but I don't

00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:16,889
remember from whom I did pick it up

00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:18,540
but it seems to be sticking around so

00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,129
socially it says that if someone you're

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,899
responsible to do some kind of work in

00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:24,809
Debian as long as he is doing that work

00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,519
well they decide how to do it nobody can

00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:29,220
go there and sell you need to do that

00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,660
work in that way unless they're ready to

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,209
commit and do the work themselves and

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,639
this is the default rule all decision is

00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:38,009
Debian by default are taken this way

00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,259
okay and then we have also democracy so

00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:42,660
we have become some kind of potential

00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,069
correction on how we take decision so we

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,529
are allowed to take decision all

00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:49,889
together in a democratic way voting on

00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:52,350
stuff we are wise enough to do that only

00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:54,300
and in general only for political reason

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,089
for philosophical reason we try not to

00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,579
do that for technical reason but we can

00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:01,649
do that even for technical ism so we try

00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:03,959
to use this as some sort of way to make

00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,689
the default way of taking decision work

00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:09,480
okay and what this mean this mean that

00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:12,029
it's very easy to have an impact on

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,679
Debian okay if you know how to do

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,980
something in there and nobody is doing

00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,689
that you can picked it up okay and if

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,119
you start doing it you will decide how

00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:22,949
to do that okay so this is why it's very

00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:24,809
easy to have an Intel impact indigent

00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:26,189
thanks to the way we take this year but

00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:28,319
it also means that the reputation in the

00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:29,910
project follow works okay if you have a

00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:31,350
good reputation in the project is

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,360
usually because we have done a lot of

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,990
work and a lot of very high quality work

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,879
okay and finally once more it means that

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,589
there are no impose decision it's not

00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,899
like the people who own the

00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:44,790
infrastructure or who employ people can

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,809
decide our decision are made

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:52,529
okay decision are made this way and last

00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:54,449
point we have end up being at some sort

00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:57,209
of fault of a huge ecosystem of

00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:58,559
derivatives okay so I believe you all

00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:00,360
know what derivative is about you take

00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,860
an existing distribution you start a

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,110
compiling packages you add your own

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,879
package you change stuff okay and you

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,959
train a completely new distribution and

00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,879
this is something that's starting to

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,069
happen in the last start clappin

00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,929
massively in the last let's say ten

00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:15,540
years okay and they've really changed

00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:18,689
the way in which distribution products

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,819
are made derivatives can focus on

00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:22,529
customization and benefit from all of

00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:24,569
the work that is done by their mother

00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:27,149
derivatives okay and Debian ended up

00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:28,709
being at root as something like 140

00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:31,330
activist turbo

00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:33,820
according to this to watch so that means

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,220
that the work we do in Debian is not

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,339
only relevant for our own let's say

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,140
direct user is useful for the for the

00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:43,000
users of all these sort of distributions

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,760
which include the most popular

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
distributions out there okay so people

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,220
out there even if they do not know rely

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,390
a lot on the work which is done in that

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:59,350
and I think this is great ok so all in

00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:01,570
all my point here is that debian is a

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,570
very important role to play in the free

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:07,300
software ecosystem in general ok and if

00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:10,120
we fail at doing what we are supposed to

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,250
do not only the direct users of debian

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,620
will fail I think free software in

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,089
general will suffer from a failure in

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:21,850
Debian of delivering what we are about

00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:23,020
so the question is are we up to what we

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,860
are supposed to do in free software in

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:29,740
general and I've seen some challenges

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,350
that I would like to discuss with you so

00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:35,410
the first challenge is staying healthy

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,850
and staying healthy for a fourth of the

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,839
project for a volunteer phase of the

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:43,839
project essentially means being able to

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,910
recruit people to find new volunteers

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,730
that here after you join the project and

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,470
if you if you have heard me talking at

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,680
that con for the past few years or in

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,600
general to to the developer public we

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,700
have always discussed the lack of

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,490
manpower as a major problem in the

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:03,760
project we cannot do stuff because we

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:05,829
have a lack of manpower okay so in fact

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,050
I've looked up the data and our

00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:09,339
recruitment in fact we can call it this

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:13,480
way it's going very well

00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:18,130
ok so over the past two years we have

00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:20,140
had 30 new Dedes more every single year

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,060
this is net in the sense this is an

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,029
actually increase in the number of DD so

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,490
I I already discounted the number of the

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:30,279
DS that top of the project because some

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,860
sort of natural turnover ok so 30 days

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:34,600
per year is quite a lot ok and if you

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,940
look at Montana's depend maintain errs

00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,589
we have something like 50 new Debian

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,000
maintenance per year so this is gross

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,220
because I didn't find the actual net

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,460
data but it's to give an idea that we

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,230
we do we are able to acquit people both

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,390
to work on them in in general whatever

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,690
the task and to work on specific package

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,850
in their car okay so I think we should

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:58,210
really stop using the lack of manpower

00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:00,700
as an excuse we are a volunteer project

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:03,070
we will always lack manpower to do

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,990
something but our ability to recruit new

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,680
people is doing well is doing very well

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:11,230
so what we really need to do is to

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,780
actually better use the manpower that we

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,090
do have and in particular I'm worried

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,940
about the barrier for contribution that

00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:21,820
exists within the Debian project okay so

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,010
one thing we discuss often is we don't

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,960
need people to maintain yet another

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,330
package into the gun archive what we

00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,520
need is people working on some of the

00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,200
core team the very infrastructure team

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,840
or in maintaining the very important

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,660
package in their crime okay but the key

00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,730
to make that work is to make it easier

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,860
for people to contribute to those things

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,210
we have a lot of service in the Debian

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,760
which are very difficult to contribute

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,830
to well services which are online which

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,200
which we have no mentions of where is

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,390
the code behind those services of word

00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,120
to iPod bags for those service these are

00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:57,190
all small attention that we could use to

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,590
make it easier to contribute within the

00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,390
Debian project and if someone starts

00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,490
working on some relief package in the

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,990
archive and if it find easier to

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,140
contribute to some more important stuff

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,910
they will do that in fact that's how I

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,310
think most of us that got involved in

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,960
the gun project ended up doing more and

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,750
more important stuff starting from the

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:20,770
easy part and climbing at a bit doing

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:22,720
the more complex stuff so if you are

00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,210
working on something within the Debian

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,930
project in addition to think at the work

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,690
you are doing

00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:31,660
please think how can I make it easier

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,460
for others to contribute to this have I

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,770
documented how to contribute to this

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,060
have I put a link of where is the source

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:40,360
code of this thing I'm entering in

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:42,190
Debian have I mentioned who should they

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,440
contact for a project all these kind of

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,480
questions this is what we it will help

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,690
in better using the manpower we have in

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,910
Debian and another one and someone will

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:55,400
probably kill me for this is diversity

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:58,220
in various sense okay so

00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,740
I think we have realized that to do an

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,800
operating system like IBM we need a lot

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,930
of skills packaging is not enough Becca

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,340
G is one piece in the puzzle but we need

00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,200
a lot of other stuff we need

00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,300
translations we need people doing the

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,130
artwork we need the systems instructor

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,480
we need porters and all this kind of

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,580
skill of quite different

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,320
we need software developers and good

00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,210
packagers and not necessarily good

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,600
software developers and vice versa

00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:26,420
we need a whole lot of different skills

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,640
and we should not think that packages

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,440
are good at doing all of it it is not

00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,620
the case the skill needed are very

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,260
different so this is one reason why I

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,300
think diversity is good for a positive

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,000
Debian but they think it's good also for

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,550
the culture discussion culture in Debian

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,820
so if you know that in a discussion

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,350
place you will find people that have

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,000
very different background from yours

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,180
very different point of view than yours

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,120
well then you need to be more cautious

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,890
about how you write things you need to

00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,560
make less assumptions when you're at

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,870
things so having a more diverse project

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,089
actually helps also in having a better

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,339
discussion culture so this is a second

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:10,430
reason why I think diversity is good for

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:13,730
them so we have done a lot in the past

00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:15,920
few years so we have sort of fixed the

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,380
membership project brushes process sorry

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,570
making it clear that we do welcome

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,790
people with a wide range of skills

00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:26,209
joining daniel and we have also more

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:28,160
recently fixed the NM debian org website

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:31,100
to make it clear to avoid the implicit

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,990
assumption that there are only packages

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,240
that we welcome okay so this is great we

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,070
have done that but as Christian

00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,200
mentioned in the previous talk stealing

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:42,290
my argument we are not doing very well

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,230
at attracting people who do stuff other

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,870
than packaging so in two years we have

00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,240
attracted only five people in the so

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,340
called non uploading the D category so

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,560
these are only five people that decided

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:57,260
to join Debian as project members and

00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,520
said you know I don't really care about

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,530
packaging we want to do something else

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:04,400
in the green project and I commit to do

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,540
that on a longer basis and I but I do

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,970
understand the value of the diamond

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,930
project and Emery to apalta only five is

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,570
a bit

00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,910
it's quite a few sorry it's a it's not

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,430
too much so we really need to understand

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,870
how to invite people with different

00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,880
backgrounds and packaging to generate

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,559
the BIM project so the I think the

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,390
diversity statement we send out is a

00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,250
step in the right direction but we need

00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,570
to do more I don't know what exactly but

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,860
we really need to do more to attract

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:32,809
those kind of people some other

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,690
challenges are related to the release

00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:38,590
process so I'm still amazed that people

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,820
on the net still complain that Debian as

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,410
unpredictable release cycles the other

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,330
day are applied on Linux you can use or

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,250
someone that was complaining that Sarge

00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,860
has been very much delayed as release

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,809
okay yes that's true so I just been a

00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,300
delayed release like three years or

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:55,610
something but it is something which

00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,320
happened seven years ago even in the

00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,870
time frame of Debian that's a lot that's

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,110
one third of our time in existence so

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:05,240
since then we have learned so the

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,120
release cycle of fetch took 22 months

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,000
same for the release cycle of Lennie the

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,040
unit cycle of squeeze took 24 months so

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,710
all of this looks pretty much

00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,580
predictable to me okay so I think we're

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,000
doing well on that front

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:22,820
and starting with Weezy for the first

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,280
time in our history with Dunn time-based

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,530
freezes you probably know that my I'm a

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,360
huge fan of that not all of us agree

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:32,540
with that but I think it's it's a huge

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,290
step forward because it helps developers

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:38,000
in planning ahead changes okay yes there

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,280
are people that will upload last minos

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,720
no matter what I understand that but for

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,690
all the people who want to plan ahead

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,870
that's a huge help and it's also helped

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:50,809
our up streams there are up streams out

00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,490
there which very much care about the

00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:54,650
version of their packages that will it

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,480
will end up in a stable Debian release

00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,490
there are people out there that if they

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,710
know we freeze on a specific date they

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,990
will commit to give long term support

00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,300
for that software okay so knowing a

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:09,020
first date in advance is huge help for

00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,540
them so I think we should keep this in

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,880
mind keep this in mind what was not

00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,490
working with the previous model like

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,260
people getting upset off about phrase

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,150
without knowing in advance when they

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,850
were they were gonna happen and I think

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:25,010
we should try to not forget this

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:29,090
so aim in the future it reliably

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:30,770
freezing every X months 24 maybe little

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,600
more than that

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,610
fewer than that I don't know but I think

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,160
we should try to keep this in mind and

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:41,660
maintain that in the future in the case

00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:44,120
you didn't notice with these frozen ok

00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,190
and we did this with the time-based

00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,930
phase I think it worked it well but

00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,440
there is still a lot of work to do and

00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:54,770
in particular we have frozen with

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,390
something like 135 more I'll see bugs

00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,940
with respect to the previous table

00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:03,770
release so there is a lot of work to do

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:05,990
for all of us ok in this work which is

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:10,040
ahead of us I think we should really aim

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:13,100
to have a short phrase period ok that's

00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,600
something I think we should aim to it

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,610
will happen it will not happen it will

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,690
depend on us but I think it should be a

00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,330
goal ok

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:23,480
it should be a goal because it will show

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,450
us that time based phrase is a

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,590
sustainable model even if it means

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:31,910
phrasing with a bit more bugs than

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:34,790
before ok it will reduce the period of

00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:37,310
time in which we are a bit frustrated in

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,940
which you cannot do far-reaching changes

00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,100
ok

00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,570
so the shorter we can keep this period

00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,500
it would be better for people who really

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:50,140
wants to make some more profound changes

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,140
as you have a question sorry

00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:56,060
so the question is how short is good

00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:59,720
well I don't know I think it should be a

00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:01,880
go I don't think we can say well I mean

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,630
staying within the limits of the past

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,520
trend like 6 month I think that's that's

00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,990
would be good better would be shorter

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,070
than that but this is not really a

00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,240
question for me I mean this is more for

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,000
the release team I think we should have

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:18,470
in mind but you should do all we can to

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,140
keep that as short as possible and also

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:24,800
there are distributions out there that

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,170
rely on testing so we do have in mind a

00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,780
single product which is the again stable

00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:32,330
which is a great product but like it or

00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,700
not people out there are using Debian

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,559
testing as a product they are using it

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,509
on their desktop machines

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,029
on a development machines because it's

00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:42,799
kind of the thing that invented rolling

00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:44,360
distributions out there and it's a great

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,450
suite okay

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,850
so keeping it short

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,889
keeping the release for the frisbee row

00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:55,220
will also help other people that rely on

00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:58,340
something like the real test so how do

00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:01,039
we do that I don't think it's really

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,649
normal to have that many or least

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,779
critical bugs at the freeze point it

00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:07,039
means that there are maintained so it

00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:09,259
means two things that there are very

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,519
hard back to fix which is normal I did

00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,059
but it also means that there are some

00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,279
maintainer

00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:16,399
that kind of neglected they work the

00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,809
didn't manage to complete to clean up

00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:21,049
their packages of furnace critical bugs

00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:22,549
before the freeze okay but it happens we

00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:24,710
are here it is up in the past it will

00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:26,809
happen again in the future so the only

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:30,980
way I think we have to release at this

00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:32,929
point is to once again keep in mind that

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,019
releasing is not something that the

00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:37,519
release team does alone they can not

00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:41,659
really is we Z alone

00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:44,090
okay so I've been bothering you with

00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:46,159
this idea since ever since way before I

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,320
became a DPL but they think the only

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,320
solution we have for this is doing an

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,440
amuse accepting an amuse welcoming an

00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,830
amuse loving an amuse so every single

00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,399
day

00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,230
please ever look at the list of all

00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:02,119
these critical bug reports I look at

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,279
this graph essentially every morning and

00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:07,129
also at the afternoon coffee to see how

00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:10,129
we're going okay really please do the

00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:11,539
same then please every day look up if

00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:15,289
there is a release critical but you can

00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:17,240
fix even and especially if it is not in

00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:19,159
your package okay there are people like

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,139
Drago which is somewhere here in their

00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,759
own that every single day thanks go

00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:25,340
every single day tries to do that and

00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,110
publish the initiative to make other do

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,820
the same it is not the only one a lot of

00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,980
other people are doing that but also

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:34,369
publishing it is very good okay and

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:37,490
really any muse that Fixer see bugs are

00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:39,110
free for all do them properly try to

00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,419
make it clear that we're trying to help

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,730
the maintainer of the involvement

00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:45,649
package but please that's the only way

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,519
we are going to release Weezie

00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:48,519
really

00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:52,610
and if you want another way of looking

00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,789
at this it's for the software

00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,480
engineering fan is collective code

00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:58,549
ownership

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,159
okay so collective code ownership is a

00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:03,590
is a notion that well with this term

00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,700
comes from extreme programming okay

00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,379
and essentially says that all

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,279
programmers have access to all of the

00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:10,129
code of project

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,350
okay so that no single person can be a

00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:15,350
bottleneck on a specific part of the

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:17,600
project okay this is considered good in

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,509
agile development this is considered a

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,659
best practice to follow in open source

00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:25,610
project management but in some way it

00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:27,950
not always considered good in Debian

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,509
which is kind of weird so in the past we

00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:32,240
didn't have this notion of maintainer

00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:34,279
maintainer then Bedell will correct me

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,259
if I'm wrong in 95 it has been

00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,139
introduced is a tried something like

00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:41,749
that okay thanks and and with that we

00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:43,580
sort of added some barriers there are

00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:46,220
useful stuff behind the notion of

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,960
maintainer like pride in what you do

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,570
being recognized for this for the work

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,860
you do which is great but we should also

00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,539
keep in mind that there are barriers

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,940
with the notion of maintainer they make

00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:58,100
it harder for other to contribute to

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,559
your package so the best approximation

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,950
we have to collective code ownership in

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,289
Debian is essentially liber being more

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,999
liberal with the name use and the team

00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:09,830
maintenance but we don't have teams

00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:12,590
which are as large as the Debian project

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,840
so liberal and amuse is really our best

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:20,509
approximation for collective code

00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:22,789
ownership in Debian and then moving to

00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:26,389
the Past - which probably would be a bit

00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:27,919
more controversial so low company

00:26:26,389 --> 00:26:31,330
involvement I think it's becoming a

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:34,789
problem in that so if you look at other

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:36,769
similar projects to Dagon with the same

00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:39,440
kind of historian with the same side you

00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:41,720
see that Debian has less paid work

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,980
opportunity around and you see that we

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,369
have few companies which are

00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:49,070
contributing directly okay so think at

00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:51,019
the Linux kernel everyone who can show

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:54,320
that can get code in the Linux kernel

00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:56,779
will find a job in five minutes okay

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,029
we do have companies that will be happy

00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:01,129
to hire the GaN developers but not as

00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:02,470
much as you have around the project's a

00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:06,350
little

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:09,290
so for me volunteering is great I

00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,510
wouldn't work on Debian on paid time I

00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,460
would not do that I work on free

00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:17,030
software for volunteering reason it

00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:20,630
matches my view of society where each of

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:22,220
us as a work and some extra time after

00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,230
work in which he does something to

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:27,200
contribute to society so this is not

00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:31,070
really for me but I think it could be a

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:34,400
problem for Debian in general why we do

00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:36,500
compete with companies and fools and

00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,500
their full stuff full sorry and their

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,210
full time employees okay so our con

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,990
currents are commercial distribution

00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:46,310
with huge means in terms of employees

00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,830
who are working on the distros that's

00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,570
fine we don't do this to we don't do

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,670
free software to not only to make money

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,070
but we need to watch out for our morale

00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:58,190
so when we start thinking stuff like

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:00,530
Debian is not innovating anymore it is

00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,720
other districts are innovating well we

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:05,150
need to keep in mind that the ratio of

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,850
force on the field might not be very

00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,320
well balanced okay so this is first

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,660
problem that I thinking having low

00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,030
distribution code according to that

00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:17,240
second reason is that there are useful

00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:20,600
tasks out there that volunteers won't

00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:23,660
bother doing I've been asked many many

00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,030
times why don't you go to other vendors

00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,580
and convince them to brain style Debian

00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:30,320
on their machines well try to find a

00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,960
volunteer that is happy to spend his

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,910
time and you know lobbying up outer

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,700
products producer to install Debian on

00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:39,950
it that's an example other example are

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,050
all sort of certification lobbying

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,840
something that very often in public

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:48,740
administration asks me is why Debian is

00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:53,420
not certified for random very high

00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:55,310
quality corporate database system ok why

00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,590
David is not certified for that unnamed

00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:00,230
system well because you need lobbying to

00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:02,690
do that you need you need people go into

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,310
the software vendor and convince them to

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,260
say yes you can run this on Debian

00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:09,140
otherwise there are people out there who

00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:10,910
won't run happen ok and all sort of

00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,210
other stuff like creating a support

00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:15,350
network that makes specific adopter

00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,910
convinced them that it will be

00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,669
they would be fine adopting that okay

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:21,740
and the last reason why I think we need

00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:24,440
a bit more of company involve in Debian

00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,960
is the sort of disturbing thought what

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,690
if only one company or a few company for

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,059
what is worth end up hiring how a lot of

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,130
Dedes the independence

00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:36,890
i've been bubbling around before will

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,539
began this is not paranoia this is a

00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,340
kind of problem that has been discussed

00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:43,070
for instance the Linux kernel community

00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,390
for a long time they they know that they

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,940
have some sort of Independence because

00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,190
they have many different companies with

00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:52,250
interest in the Linux kernel which sort

00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:53,929
of balance each other so if we don't

00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,260
have more companies dressed in in that

00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:59,630
and we risk ending up in that situation

00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,860
so some sort of very early work in

00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,559
progress which is trot which I'm trying

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,690
to to kick-start is the sort of user

00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,220
group Debian companies of companies who

00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:10,070
have some strategic interest in Debian

00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,289
okay and want to try to work on fixing

00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:14,330
this problem there might be other

00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:15,770
solutions I don't know I wanted to

00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,070
present this a problem I think in the

00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:24,080
long run we need to think about this and

00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:26,870
the last thing is the DPL which happens

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,659
to be me at the moment so what does the

00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:32,299
DPL do for you so according to my family

00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:35,659
possibly too much but that's a separate

00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:37,220
problem so it does fancy stuff right it

00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:39,770
goes to conferences around the world is

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,390
invited to talk about Debian and he has

00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,760
a Wikipedia page and all this kind of

00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:47,900
fancy stuff but you also have to do all

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,179
sort of needed but pretty boring for

00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,700
Java for the average geek stuff okay

00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:55,130
he has to take care of money approving

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,559
your embossment buying out where that

00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:59,539
confident that conf donations try to

00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,360
avoid bankruptcy which is a nice thing

00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:05,750
to do and it takes care of lawyers I've

00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,039
never been working with lawyers as much

00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,740
as in the last three years

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,240
okay so takes care of so what we do with

00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,250
patents can we have it in the archive or

00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,470
not what do the Train locks what we do

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,059
with the copyright for instance can you

00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,500
your license that they've done logger

00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:21,049
with the it--on they're mining some

00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,940
other asset we have and legally

00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:25,100
responsibility and what if a Debian

00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,679
developer get a lawsuit okay all this

00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,840
sort of stuff which is useful because if

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,500
we now have a bit

00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,480
more how to say announced multimedia

00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,370
experience in Debian is also because we

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,529
take the time to discuss this stuff down

00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:41,169
with lawyers that are expert in free

00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:44,020
software okay and then does mediations

00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:45,669
and it does reports okay how many

00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,039
reports from me have you got in the past

00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:49,990
three years yeah too many okay this is

00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:54,700
all sort of boring stuff which i think

00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:58,240
is useful for the project but then as it

00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:00,700
is today the DPL is a problem I am a

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,309
problem but it's not me it's the role of

00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:06,880
the PLO as a problem in Debian it just

00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:10,000
does not scale okay we basically rely on

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,630
some sort of a flock okay that we will

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,750
find candidates that will have enough

00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,520
time to do all of this okay and it's

00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,890
quite a bit of time I don't know if it

00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,720
is wise to only rely on ton unlock to

00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:27,700
finding those people over the ears

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:31,149
forever second problem transparency is

00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,309
very hard I've tried to work worked

00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:36,700
quite a bit on that okay I think I spend

00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:38,620
like half of my time as DPL in trying to

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,450
to tell you what is going now and only

00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,470
the other half in working on stuff I've

00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,380
been happy to do that

00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:46,600
but it's very hard and as long as I'm

00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,299
talking to myself or replying to

00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,490
inquiries that comes to the leader

00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:54,549
mailbox there are some sort of intrinsic

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,890
limits if you are in a team of with more

00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:58,149
people you need to discuss things and if

00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,860
you force yourself to discuss things

00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:02,860
publicly you don't have these intrinsic

00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:07,149
limits and the third problem is there is

00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:11,049
very little institutional memory okay so

00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:15,250
we keep on essentially readies covering

00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:17,799
the job at each DPL change okay yes we

00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,950
can I can write a DPL to with the help

00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:23,470
of all past dps we can do that okay but

00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:26,350
things change and essentially the key of

00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:29,559
the problem is that being the DPL is

00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:31,990
unlike any other task in the project so

00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:35,200
it's difficult to know who will be a

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,190
good DPL before because yes you're she

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,320
has never done that before

00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,700
okay and there is actually only trial

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,580
and error there is very little

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:46,700
institutional memory of how to do things

00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:49,730
so how can we fix this I've been

00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,590
thinking a lot about this is one of the

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,500
reason why I decided to run again for a

00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:57,169
third time so essentially I think the

00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,929
problem is that the role of the DPL is a

00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:02,779
relic of the benevolent dictator era in

00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:05,840
free software okay it made a sense in

00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:08,899
the past okay today project of the size

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,240
of Debian are not fun in this way not

00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:13,609
even for only the management past part

00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,440
ok so we do not do the technical part

00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:18,290
with the benevolent dictator which is

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,950
very good but we do that for all the

00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:23,570
kind of management parts ok so I think

00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:26,720
the solution the only solution possible

00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:29,810
here is have some sort of Board of

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,899
Directors and other projects have which

00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:34,909
essentially help the DPL the droll of

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:36,500
the DPL should not disappear I think we

00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:39,109
should keep try to keep this as informal

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,790
as possible but if we have a group of

00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:42,980
people that we can call the board they

00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:45,710
be on board of directors that can have

00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,210
some sort of turnover ok to guarantee

00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,460
that there is some institutional memory

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,260
so there should not be tied to the

00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,330
normal DPL period otherwise you have the

00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,790
the problem of institutional memory

00:34:53,330 --> 00:35:00,500
again with periodic meetings for

00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:01,970
transparency ok and if we do at this you

00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,760
can have the people on this kind of

00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:07,220
board that help out and show if

00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,750
themselves they will be able to do good

00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,660
dps or not ok

00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,730
so I think this is the the only way to

00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,540
make their all of the DPL scalable

00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:20,089
without changing the nature of what the

00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,099
institution is and as an interim

00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:24,140
solution I am trying to collect a group

00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:25,820
of DPL helpers within the call for help

00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,550
thanks to all the people who are applied

00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:31,599
so what I'm trying to do is to try to

00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:38,660
see if this kind of things could work

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:41,420
and yet the DPL will remain so given I'm

00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:43,220
here basically because someone a few

00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,619
years ago started joking about me

00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:47,839
becoming DPL well that's a good occasion

00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:49,609
for all of you to start thinking at the

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,680
next one and maybe start joking with him

00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:53,220
whether he or she will be happy to

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,470
candidate the next year

00:35:53,220 --> 00:36:00,900
so thanks a lot it's a pleasure to be

00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:04,230
here and if you have questions or

00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:15,900
thoughts I'm available Thanks

00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:15,900
[Applause]

00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:27,030
the last part where you talk about

00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:30,770
solving the DPL really caught my fancy

00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:35,790
because I've given a lot of thought to

00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:37,950
non corporate organizations I'm very

00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:40,680
very ignorant about your job so please

00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:48,480
take that in mind if I say something you

00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:52,079
think is really stupid now board of

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,030
directors I personally even before you

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,480
said that I was thinking Council of

00:36:54,030 --> 00:37:00,630
Elders now there's there's a big

00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:03,270
difference there there's a big

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,490
difference there and it goes beyond the

00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:10,560
choice of words and and your particular

00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:13,050
leanings sociologically because one idea

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,140
that I had is you could try to integrate

00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:18,869
a board of past dpl's that means they

00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,240
inherently know about the job like I

00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:23,640
said well you know what's the problem I

00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,740
came from a counter where one of the

00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,480
main problems that very held early

00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:30,210
people are holding and taking decision

00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,650
for very young people so I kind of a fan

00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,930
of the idea that you should really do

00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:36,810
you know change people doing stuff over

00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:38,730
time so you know getting elderly people

00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:40,349
start to get more fixed on their past

00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,050
position and know something we really

00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:43,710
need some kind of movement but but yeah

00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,339
I see your point

00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:51,869
and and another couple of ideas that I

00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:56,760
had was one is it seems to me that the

00:37:51,869 --> 00:38:00,240
dpl's should not that one DPL should not

00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,670
start when the other one ends transition

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,570
period yeah sure now I agree that two

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:08,540
would be useful which includes mentoring

00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:10,700
but also not not just like your the

00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,400
newly peel and I'm here as an advisor

00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:16,310
but but an actual overlap of

00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,230
responsibilities and that forces

00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:21,680
discussion forces some level of

00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:24,200
transmission of knowledge yeah and the

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:28,970
other I think we should need some space

00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:30,800
for others to just as a reminder for

00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,630
video team folks there will be a video

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:38,720
team meeting ten minutes after this talk

00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:40,910
ends here so same subject could you

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,840
elaborate why you don't think a DPL

00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:46,820
board would work so would not work a

00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,760
would work so what I think would do

00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:52,340
would not work is having a DPL board as

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,810
proposing the past which is tied which

00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,390
is basically elected together with the

00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,520
DPL and will last the same time as DPL

00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,950
because at that point you have again the

00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,960
problem of that all those people we need

00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:05,570
to learn the job when they change so I

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,510
think it should you know be around more

00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:10,550
than a single DPL period mainly to have

00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:14,360
some sort of institutional memory of how

00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:16,340
you do things I actually mean turnover

00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,170
is fine with me but why don't you think

00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,900
that a board of directors without a

00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:24,620
single DPL entity as a but being DPL as

00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,930
a whole the whole team of the peels with

00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:31,520
turnover why so you mean elected all

00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:34,670
together with turnover like ya know that

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,530
I think is what could work but my point

00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,690
is that I think we should first convince

00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:40,250
ourself that it works before trying to

00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:42,260
you you know start voting and have

00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:44,480
institutional decisions and all this

00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:47,090
kind of stuff so that's is the direction

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,070
which I mean all other big free software

00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:51,200
project like out there has been using

00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:55,150
for the past ten years and I think it

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,150
works the question is how you get there

00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,140
how do you see what what you think is a

00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,140
different between delegates and the

00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,450
board of directors okay so that's very

00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,630
very good question thanks Kurt so the

00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:10,310
problem with delegates is that we tend

00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,890
to make the Lessig allegation which are

00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:15,110
not time limited okay

00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,790
so essentially every time you delegate

00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:19,309
someone in an on-time meeting the way

00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:22,429
you are creating some sort of power the

00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:26,179
we'll need some specific action either

00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:28,309
to be changed or only to say okay I want

00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:30,919
to reassess whether I'm still interested

00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:33,169
in doing this or not so it could work

00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:36,380
but it requires so either you start

00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:39,199
doing time based allegations and keep

00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,699
track of them or you have the problem

00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,429
that you are creating entities that will

00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:45,640
stay unless someone says no you need to

00:40:43,429 --> 00:40:49,099
go now or they step down voluntarily

00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:53,299
just a quick question so what exactly is

00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:55,640
stopping us from engaging in this now I

00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:58,189
mean it doesn't look like there's any

00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:02,329
particular permissions necessary for the

00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:03,890
DPO board okay not selected I think

00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:06,499
nothing is stopping now and that's why

00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:08,929
I've been calling for helpers so that is

00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:11,659
that will be the seed from which try if

00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:14,359
this works and if it can if it's worth

00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:16,640
making it more stable in the long run so

00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:20,900
essentially what's missing is guess what

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,729
people doing the work but but seriously

00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:27,349
you input the I think an important part

00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:30,349
is that it's more easier to find DPL

00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:31,939
candidates then to find volunteers to

00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:34,640
work on the people tasks before the

00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:36,049
elections which is kind of scary because

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,439
it might seem that you know you have a

00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:45,319
motivation to Canada for DPL but a bit

00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:46,669
less so to do that before so click one

00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:48,229
very brief suggestion about how a

00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:51,890
transition period might work and then a

00:41:48,229 --> 00:41:53,779
sort of topic of a question that's about

00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,219
delegates and how to solve a skin the

00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:56,959
same scaling problem there because

00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:59,359
you're the DP also thinking about the

00:41:56,959 --> 00:42:01,069
whole project so as far as a transition

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,749
period what would be really useful which

00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:05,239
I don't think our current rules allow is

00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:06,650
after the new DPL is chosen have instead

00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:09,169
of having two details at once that's

00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:12,289
kind of confusing but maybe a month or

00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:13,999
two where the old DPL still zpl but the

00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:15,859
new DPL is already known so that they

00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:18,909
can explicitly be learning and then a

00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:25,189
month or two of advising afterwards but

00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:27,859
about delegates for scaling delegates in

00:42:25,189 --> 00:42:29,449
a way that doesn't make people have too

00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:30,739
much long-term institutional single

00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:32,000
point of failure memory and they're in

00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:34,460
their head

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,960
and doesn't tell have people to get to

00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,750
fossilised enroll but still allowing

00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,890
them to serve in for you know several

00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:43,760
years in a useful way

00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:46,369
what do you think about that well I

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,380
think could be an improvement but I

00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:50,119
think it's just you know a small patch

00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,250
and incremental improvement on way on

00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:54,470
how we're doing things well I think we

00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,040
really have a more substantial problem

00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,900
here

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,990
so it could be an improvement but I

00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:02,060
think we need some larger changes I

00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:05,570
think personally that's my opinion of

00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:07,400
course if you start going to systems

00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:10,280
where you have overlapping DPS you have

00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,970
a very large risk of having a lame-duck

00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,790
DPL who's afraid to still make decisions

00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:19,820
and for that reason me personally I'm

00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:21,710
not in favor of that sort of solution

00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,540
although I think you need going to an

00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:27,590
elected board or something could be a

00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:29,480
good solution so it seems I've made a

00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,359
mistake of raising a point that is very

00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,340
you know it's sticking the idea of okay

00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,990
how we can change the formality

00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,730
formalities in Debian so thanks a lot

00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,530
but if you also have a question on

00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:43,339
something else I've said please feel

00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:54,020
free but if you really only have

00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:56,140
question on this of course go ahead so

00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:59,060
one of the things you said that make

00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:02,060
significant is the fact that can you

00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:03,950
very okay be yeah one of the things you

00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,290
said makes Debian significant is the

00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,880
fact that we have a standard of freeness

00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,500
that other people look to to help this

00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,050
yes sorry in this we have a standard of

00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,400
freeness that other people look to to

00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:17,750
help them decide whether they're doing

00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:22,250
okay and I'm wondering if our process

00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:25,040
for giving folks that the feedback they

00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:27,200
need needs reinforcing and needs a

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,480
health check in terms of the debian -

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:33,770
legal mailing list is where that

00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:36,200
activity happens and debian - legal

00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:40,250
certainly has a reputation within the

00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:42,020
larger developer community of being a

00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,400
bit of the the inmates are running the

00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:45,680
asylum

00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,059
and if this is something that is

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,309
important and that we agree that this is

00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:53,809
important let me encourage other

00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:57,349
developers to participate and be voices

00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:59,750
of sanity there because if you know it's

00:44:57,349 --> 00:45:02,539
the place that Outsiders go to get

00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:05,270
checks on their licenses and if there

00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:08,180
aren't actually people who are Debian

00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:10,039
developers and and who are who are

00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:13,970
actually going to provide the advice and

00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:16,369
provide an opinion that has some some

00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:20,089
semblance some resemblance to the actual

00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:22,609
projects opinion then yes I completely

00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:24,650
agree it's a problem and I've seen this

00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:27,260
many times people coming to me and say

00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:29,150
hey Debian thinks this of that license

00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,309
because on this thread on Debian legal

00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:32,839
this is the outcome so I agree it is a

00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:37,039
problem first of all the problem is the

00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:38,839
mismatch among the dos party I threaten

00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,960
to be illegal and the actual position we

00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:43,970
have I think the first solution that is

00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,900
already on the website but not really

00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:50,420
well known is making is publishing our

00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:53,299
decisions about licenses and our

00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:55,460
rationale for that so our right now the

00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:59,059
authority that decides what the eff is

00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:01,789
different is FTP master okay this is the

00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:03,470
current the status Coyne data so when

00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:04,940
they say something is not free they

00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:06,770
usually provide very good argument for

00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,569
that the problem is that is essentially

00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,980
posted on some nailing list last time I

00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:12,200
think it's been on Debian project and

00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:16,069
not really easy to find not really well

00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:18,740
documented so we do have on wwww org a

00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:20,450
page with the license with consider free

00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:23,869
and the rising we do not consider free

00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:25,910
but it's very little known and it's not

00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:28,190
really up-to-date so I think the first

00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:31,430
part of the fix there is fixing that

00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:33,470
kind of editorial part and then for the

00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:35,599
illegal so I've never participated on

00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:39,589
the mailing list so I cannot really say

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:41,359
how how could be the climate or whatever

00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:43,539
else on that list can be fixed because I

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,839
mean I would speak of something I'm not

00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:50,990
competent

00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:54,680
on doing so stand up so last thing I

00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:56,450
will surely will do that on mailing list

00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,170
when the time come but given the last

00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,849
time I

00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:02,030
to you in person I want to do it here so

00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:03,380
thanks a lot for this path well two year

00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,799
in the house that will become three

00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,290
years

00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:08,780
you're a very demanding community but

00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,300
you're worth every single bit of it it's

00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:17,780
thanks a lot

00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:17,780
