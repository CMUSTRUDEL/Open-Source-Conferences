so if you're here and we're also here

00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:45,540
yesterday then it probably means that

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,570
you are interested in DEFCON if you're

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:52,290
here at all if you are from a country

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:55,530
that is not immediately adjacent to

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:58,770
Switzerland then you should consider

00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,810
putting forward a bit for DEFCON 14 at

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,780
the moment we don't need to do anything
