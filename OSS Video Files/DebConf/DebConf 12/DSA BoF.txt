so I guess it's time to start videos

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:17,520
ready almost okay so welcome this very

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,590
early morning for the DSA buff DSA is

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,380
for Debian system and administrators

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:27,269
team with finally embodies and I will

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,369
follow the questions on our see if

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,260
there's some some other Debian system

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:37,440
and researchers are already on our sea

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:40,530
and so hello I'm my name is fellow named

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,219
Boris I am part of the Debian system

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,379
administration team the team is that

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,340
it's Luca Philip Jose Martinez oval

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:53,399
Hellas Peter Paul father with Steven

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,030
gran and since last year myself and

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,510
Tallis

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:02,840
we are the two newest members we were we

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,710
joined the team last year after Deb conf

00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,520
unfortunately none of the others could

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:11,460
be here and join us although I think

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,689
there are no I see most of them shows

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,110
unfortunate because there was the least

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:22,080
active member of the team but I happened

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:23,490
to be here so our duties is to to

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,049
maintain the debian or machines

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,030
basically except alias but when we talk

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,520
about this a administered machines we're

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,799
talking about the machines that are all

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,340
of Debian org we do general system in

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,380
there we do the accounts and held up

00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:43,470
some core services like mail and DNS and

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,290
we provide support and we provide

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,070
service and support two teams are on

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:54,240
Debian like SP master bugs master or

00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:56,729
Porter's and Bill D and so on multiple

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,439
teams here won't talk about all of them

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:04,680
and we also deal with Hardware faults

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,950
and we deal with our hosters we deal

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,380
with our local admins so if you have a

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,020
hard fall in one of our many locations

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:20,710
more than thirty one point was even

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:24,640
fifty I think we talk to them we use we

00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:29,800
use Papa the laws we use get zealots udl

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,360
DUP is our custom DUP interface dub

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,810
configuration at count management

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,900
basically we using Union and I guess

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:43,200
monitoring and our tea for our bug

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,200
tracking and many many many other tools

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:51,280
so since last year since the last year's

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:54,040
buff we had some new things so we we met

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,420
up in Oslo in March there's a mailing

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,980
the medieval announced for that but in

00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,700
case you haven't read it I'll talk a bit

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,560
about that so first of all what we

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,660
discussed was a the long term

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,000
infrastructure plan so also known as a

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:13,900
five-year plan so according to that plan

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,300
all core services that means basic

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,490
services plus fifty master and web

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,640
servers and so on

00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,530
must be under warranty at all times we

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,540
had this we had a situation in the past

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,620
year with where we had some very old

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:34,330
machines very slow as well there weren't

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:36,820
under warranty we basically were waiting

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:41,020
for them to fail and so on

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:45,280
so we're plan is to be able to use

00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,720
Debian's funds or sponsorships to renew

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,420
this hardware every now and then and

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,510
keep at most five years and also by

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,430
warranty for these five years and we

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,520
want to use also several great hardware

00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,910
rather than individuals saying I have

00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,800
this desktop PC or this old server on my

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,520
basement I don't need it anymore

00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,500
like let's Debian have it and then we

00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,740
use it for something core so we instead

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,800
want to use a surrogate hardware and

00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:18,239
maybe use money donations for that if we

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:23,440
don't have any harder donation for that

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:25,160
additionally we want to centralize into

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,220
three to five core

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,590
locations for three to five

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,020
complications for our core services so

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,460
now we are as we said before we have 30

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,870
locations and this is too much this is

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,080
also this is problematic with

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:45,380
communication with hosters so what we

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,040
want to do is consolidate into three to

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,450
five there are some special restrictions

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:56,480
like that if master needs to be in the

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:59,180
US so this is an exception there's also

00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,510
this also doesn't affect portal boxes

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,810
and build these because for this kind of

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,970
hardware usually need some special

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:12,140
different hosting like for example at

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:13,700
arm but this is affects all the core

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,770
services and we also want to use

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:21,650
virtualization for that like we believe

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:25,550
it's maturing as we speak and it's makes

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:30,610
sense for us to give new services a new

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,610
VM in one of these Center locations

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:41,270
finally we talked about users and groups

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,890
we want to do some cleanup and for

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,580
security reasons like disable and use

00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:48,650
shell accounts we there are over 50,000

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,580
shell accounts in Debian machines in -

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:55,040
in total and some we would like to move

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,940
on by disabling most of them if they're

00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,100
not used and but not prevent people from

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,140
doing work by providing an automated way

00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:08,090
like signed mail for them to be

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:10,669
activated the same direction wants you

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,490
also vertically to confirm group

00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:16,880
memberships like a yearly mail perhaps

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,960
that says here's the groups you're in if

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,790
you don't want to be in any of them

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,750
reply to this mail or the other way

00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:27,410
around the goal of these two actions is

00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,360
to reduce exposure not remove anyone's

00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:35,060
privileges or stop anyone from doing

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,500
work and another thing that while we're

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,810
talking in this meeting about this is

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,520
also there was work done before the

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,210
meeting is the new single sign-on

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,039
service this is still working progress

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:49,729
but there are some services have used it

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:52,460
already like Noonan or the new nm

00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:56,510
website the goal with this is to have

00:06:52,460 --> 00:07:00,440
one single password not the password

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:02,240
that you have for DB but a different

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,770
password that you can set and this will

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,720
be used by all web services are on

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:10,940
debian that wants you somehow off

00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:14,690
indicates members of the project you can

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,100
contact us by maybe not been at least

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,039
ariannol this is a list that includes

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,979
also local admins or Debian admin at

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,630
Debian org this is only the core team we

00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:29,300
used in anger out on IRC Debian or

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:31,280
Debian hash Debian does admin and of

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:37,520
course for all requests you can file up

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:40,550
a ticket naughty so this is mostly a

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,680
buff in the description of that schedule

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:48,039
because we really want this to be a Q&A

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:52,990
and get input from you or questions or

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,990
anything else you want to ask this a lot

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:07,780
do you use sound for storage

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:14,110
what kind on Sam we use hpm essays on

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:17,650
one of our sites and local storage some

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:20,260
other things the EM essays are being

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:24,810
used to host a virtual machine images

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,810
mostly and if you master

00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,510
so how many machines have really

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,260
actually goes and where are they so some

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:45,339
idea of how much so we have around 100

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:50,440
3540 a physical machines plus another 40

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:52,720
now I think different machines and the

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,110
central locations that we host machines

00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:02,440
the three to five or the University of

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:05,470
British Columbia in Canada the miserable

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,769
tenor network of Darmstadt the Greek

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,390
recession technology Network we have

00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:15,940
some machines that the Oregon State

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:17,950
University we have some at MIT in

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,510
general have many locations for many

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:24,790
machines these are the ones with most

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:28,209
machines there we have somewhat SIL in

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:30,570
Austria I'm sure I'm forgetting

00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,570
something

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,280
so off there's 140 or a lot of those

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,430
build these in a new relatively small

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,650
number of core machines yeah

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,530
this includes build ease and portal

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:57,550
boxes which are the number of

00:09:50,530 --> 00:10:01,020
architectures times two or three you

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,880
mentioned some goals in reference to

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:08,710
centralizing the servers so what are the

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:11,650
major issues around about from the you

00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:14,050
know move of the service itself in

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:18,250
reference to you know university sun-ho

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:22,510
surprises itself so um there are two

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,910
issues here one is that we're having

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:27,000
many locations doesn't scale you have

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:31,300
too many people who talk with you have

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,370
too many issues to work with the other

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,080
thing is that we really want to the

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,730
criteria with that we said for choosing

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,120
these locations is that we want really

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:43,810
professional hosting we don't want

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:47,560
people's basements or under the person's

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:52,120
desk we want data centers with redundant

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:54,730
power with air conditioning with ipv4

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,240
and ipv6 address space and the ability

00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:01,320
to manage or reverse DNS we want

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,630
responsive hands on like if you have a

00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,810
failure of or you need replacement we

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:11,770
can ask and get a reply soon rather than

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:15,640
repeatedly ask and hence responsive

00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,290
local admins in general we want

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,720
something to be reliable and

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:24,160
professional and this is not the case

00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,140
for many of our thirty locations but for

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,720
the ones that we chose this is this is

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,180
the case and we also want a lot of

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,250
Rackspace so we don't want small hosting

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,920
locations we want you to have as many

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,660
machines as possible so hospice would

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,830
give it like ten you or half Iraq or

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:44,670
Iraq maybe it's ideal for us and good

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,670
connectivity obviously

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:56,040
I wonder what what considerations have

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,230
been made about like the risks so I mean

00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,200
if you have all the servers in three to

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,930
five locations so they it seems like if

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,190
you lose one hoster which seems even

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,600
more likely if they're hosting more

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,850
machines if they're based there

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,420
basically you know they're doing more

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:16,140
for us it seems more at risk but what

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:18,390
happens if you lose a location 33% of

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,540
all the machines with it but that's

00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:24,960
neither risk however as we talked before

00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:27,300
these are really reliable clusters so

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,980
there are more reliable than most of our

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,640
current hosting so we're hoping it won't

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,410
come to that

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,720
this is one case the other one is that

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,200
these are very diverse locations across

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,030
the globe and everything that's

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,240
important we're trying to have it in

00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:48,060
multiple sites and also note that this

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,640
does include mirrors this is this is

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:53,010
about central infrastructure not the

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,710
mirrors yeah I guess I was thinking in

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,270
terms of you know there's changes in the

00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:00,350
organization there and they decide to no

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:05,510
longer donate those resources today via

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:08,730
we we have more than three five offers

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:11,130
so we can always move things but usually

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,980
we we ask for some commitment before

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:16,070
moving things into such location and

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:23,760
we've got the commitment from all this

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:25,140
before so what is a sustainable budget

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,090
for her how much we spending in the

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:30,480
moment and energy proposing we change

00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:32,220
that by having better kit I don't

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,370
remember the exact figures it's

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:39,750
certainly more than we're currently

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:42,360
spending so we're this is a considerable

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,930
amount of money that we ask that if here

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,030
the DPL seemed to be open to that I

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:53,360
don't remember the exact figures I think

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:56,220
were posted on the list as I'm I think

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,530
yeah but it's it's an amount of money to

00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,460
have good hardware we also get discounts

00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,610
from vendors

00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:05,700
if we can get free hardware we're open

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,690
to that as well obviously we're also one

00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,490
of the things we discussed at the

00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:15,480
meeting was to ask to have a sponsorship

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:18,690
page so that we can ask for money more

00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,610
effectively from for sponsors like we're

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,860
looking at through PhD sponsorship page

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,440
which they list their sponsors and they

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,260
say these people have been kind and gave

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,360
us AI platinum sponsor or something like

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,950
that

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,990
our current sponsors page is really

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:39,209
outdated it has some entries that are

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,070
people who donated like a disc or

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:43,020
something and we are how they don't have

00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,630
some major sponsor of ours so we want to

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,240
change that and be able to be to give

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:52,410
more visibility to our large sponsors

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:55,100
and if anyone wants helping that would

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,100
be welcome

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:09,060
you mentioned that Westar has to be in

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,720
the u.s. can you just it is for legal

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:15,120
reasons as far as I know but some export

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,440
control of the US I'm not really sure of

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,980
the details

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,390
maybe someone else's but as far as I

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,089
know for legal reasons every master

00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:27,769
should be in the US so we can't really

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,769
move it to another hosting location

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:35,130
another thing was I wanted to thanks for

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:38,250
all the effort you've met in publishing

00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:41,880
all you SVN get and configuration

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:43,589
repository for puppet net use when you

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,750
know whatever it's really great to

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:48,120
publish that so people can get

00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,620
inspiration from that these are public

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,120
all of our puppet configuration is in

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,700
public get all of our noggins

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,000
configurations in public heats and

00:15:52,700 --> 00:16:00,810
several other things most of them are in

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,300
some DSA machines the get the first

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,220
story but we're mirroring them on Debian

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,600
org so if you go to get Debian org

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,649
there's Debian - DSA and there are

00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,190
multiple git repositories they'll have

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:18,329
all of our infrastructure we also have

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:21,570
all of our documentation our internal

00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:25,410
documentation in the public it's on a

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:28,380
wiki on DSA - Debian org so anyone can

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:32,100
look there and see what what we're doing

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,779
and how we're doing it and in general we

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,899
don't mind getting asked on how we do

00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:43,320
this were thoroughly open with what we

00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:45,810
do about single sign-on would it be

00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,270
possible or envisioned or has it been

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:54,589
envisioned that we could expand this to

00:16:48,270 --> 00:17:00,149
non DTE users such as guest areas or

00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:02,490
debconf attendees for example think it

00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:04,020
has been discussed but we're not there

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,249
yet

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:11,720
I think that kind of little

00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:15,359
hello yeah it will be even harder since

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,629
there is no such thing as indicator of

00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:43,429
that these other on the Deaf culture

00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:43,429
structure and one else

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:53,960
come on sorry

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,990
well what is done with the old hardware

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,910
what is done with the old hardware when

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,850
it's removed from the data center is it

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:18,210
sold in on on eBay or whatever not not

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:23,040
as far as I know we usually give it away

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:25,170
to hostas or other projects this hasn't

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,480
been done very much into the past

00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,980
because we used to keep old hardware and

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,160
we have like 10 year old hardware in

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:46,140
production but slowly we want to change

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:48,870
that and have more current hardware so

00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,340
DSi seems like quite a large team these

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,200
days compared to what I remember in the

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:57,390
past does that mean that you actually

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:59,340
have enough manpower so we're a large

00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,930
team not all of us are active at all

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,030
points so for the past year for example

00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:06,960
I wasn't very activity to some personal

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:10,620
issues we're always welcome more

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,310
manpower as anyone unfortunately for the

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,780
SI is hard

00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:17,550
give the SI status to more members

00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,520
because that means roots on all machines

00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:23,310
and that's not something we can easily

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,990
do however we can accept patches on our

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,580
popular poster you can test them review

00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:30,540
them and push the push them ourselves

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:35,700
and there are also some low-hanging

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:40,980
fruits that someone could help us with

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:44,820
like Python code like UDL DUP and

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,670
rewrite of it and so on and that's much

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:53,430
needed and we haven't be able to push

00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:55,790
that yet so yeah hope is still needed as

00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,790
always

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:07,130
I guess it comes under one of the later

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,390
sessions today what do you actually do

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,510
you have a plan already for the

00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:14,929
virtualization stuff you'd like to use

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:19,610
or is that still a question to decide so

00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:23,330
we used to use lib fear and KVM were

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:25,160
trying nowadays ganeti which is

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:30,260
something that will be presented later

00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:32,150
on today we still with KVM and vanities

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,360
offering us a classroom management for

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:37,720
our across machines so we've installed

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,840
it already on a cluster in the

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:43,340
University of Leeds Columbia and the new

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,600
you DeeDee for example is being hosted

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:51,290
there and we're planning to use that

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,230
more if it worked well for us okay I

00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,940
guess I was thinking more of stuff like

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,580
do do scripts to just kind of

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,220
instantiate a service so that we could

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:04,040
at the drop of a hat recreate the box

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,510
that does blah very easily you know

00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,130
making you build these by just having

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:10,790
doo-doo scripts for it and all that kind

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,049
of cloudy nonsense that people do it

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,250
might actually be quite useful if we

00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,160
have a problem with hardware that breaks

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,470
you can just set it up again but anyone

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,760
that's actually practical and on

00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:23,210
so with GaN any we can easily

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,309
instantiate new VMs we haven't made

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:28,150
plans for something that automated yet

00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:31,820
like juju or something like that or

00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:34,790
anything cloudy that would allow random

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,840
users to create VMs or us being able to

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,360
create VMs easily

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,950
we're not there yet it might be

00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,000
something that we need to consider for

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,000
the future I don't know

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,560
just a short information from our c4

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,740
Martin Martin that says that the budget

00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:01,220
for hardwood replacement is 20 K 25 to

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,140
35 K per year which is not the actual

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,780
money that flows in but the planned

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,610
money that should flow out so if you

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:18,590
have ideas for money to flow in please

00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:24,590
contact the SA as far as the reader see

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:28,280
it's the plan we have a spreadsheet that

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:30,230
we made that has this number and a plan

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,910
for the next 5 years for all machines so

00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:36,290
we took all of our core infrastructure

00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:38,480
put a five-year plan and looked at what

00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,490
we need to renew this year next year the

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,890
year after that and so on and estimated

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,590
the cost this can vary a lot because of

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:48,280
discounts and so on but this is an

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:51,440
estimate ballpark figure for the DPL

00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,960
it's also been mentioned on our see that

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,280
it's not to be forgotten that most build

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,310
these are not on mainstream

00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,850
architectures so it also creates sort of

00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,850
problems

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:17,810
[Music]

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:21,230
other questions for people who have

00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:23,450
Debian dotnet machine an official one

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:29,110
what does infrastructure that can be

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:32,090
used by them - for instance

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,580
authentication of CDs and stuff like

00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,140
that

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,820
this was explicitly discussed on how we

00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:42,770
could integrate as a cell with Debian

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:44,540
dotnet I've double is working on that I

00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:47,930
think there is a plan although there are

00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,490
some restrictions on what to do with

00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,590
that because this single sign-on things

00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,990
worked with cookies and you would want

00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:56,750
someone to be able to impersonate

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,370
someone else on Debian org so it's a

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,740
different security domain as far as I

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,290
remember but I don't really know the

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:06,020
specifics double is the main driver on

00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:09,760
this and still know better and this is

00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:14,740
still working progress as I said so it's

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,740
it's being targeted at though

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:40,110
other questions this is somewhat related

00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:43,180
to the Debian dotnet but not completely

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:46,120
in that that discussion one use for the

00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:51,460
internet was mentioned that it's kind of

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:55,210
an incubator of new services so do you

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:57,550
actually prefer if people do it that way

00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,740
on their own machines or someone else

00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:03,220
machine's not DSi maintained and just

00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:06,430
use Debian dotnet for these new services

00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,890
they're trying to get into the project

00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:12,640
or what you actually prefer to have

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:15,370
these things on DSA maintained machines

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,230
from the beginning and if yes are you

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:21,370
also willing to give people access to

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:23,770
try out these AG experiments so

00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,290
incubating services into your own

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:28,420
servers and they end up net domains is

00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:31,840
is fine with us so that there's nothing

00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,730
wrong with that in my opinion talking

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,650
with the SA early when you're developing

00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,660
a service that you intend to make it an

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,410
official service at the end is good

00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:44,140
because then we can perhaps find some

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:46,570
areas which are not acceptable for us or

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,060
for the project and talking about it

00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:51,430
early might help them we might have

00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,320
custom early instead of working on it

00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:58,000
for a long time and then just dropping

00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:01,390
it on DSA as for access we've been

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,930
fairly good at that I think especially

00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:07,270
nowadays with visualization we can

00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:10,810
create a VM and put the service there

00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:12,820
and give access there that being said I

00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:15,670
mean there are many things that people

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,020
work and don't really finish so it's a

00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:21,040
big overhead for us to have maintain a

00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:22,300
large fleet of VMs so if someone is

00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,880
serious about something yeah sure we can

00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:31,650
talk about posting of DSA

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,650
[Music]

00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:49,549
could you talk a little more about the

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:52,640
single sign-on plans again Zobel is the

00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:59,830
one driving this he's using a software

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,830
called Dax I as far as I remember sorry

00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:13,669
sorry yeah this is a web single sign-on

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,899
solution that it's packaged in Debian it

00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:20,960
was is in is enough to install nothing

00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:22,250
too complicated we look at sam'l and it

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,600
was bit complicated

00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:27,080
I've had some experience the past with

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,179
that this is a simple thing that's using

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,399
an Apache module as far as I remember

00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:34,820
that you can put in front of services

00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:38,870
and it will authenticate users against a

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:41,389
centralized oh I'm sure that when we

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,490
have something more concrete to

00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:45,470
pronounce there will be a program

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:53,120
management with technical details as

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:57,980
well so from our see there is a question

00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:06,870
from Martine what do you want from the

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:22,330
SA that is not done yet nothing

00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:26,160
we want more ponies with you and thirst

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,160
of that question other questions

00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:37,090
everybody's reading mail fundamentally

00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:41,260
as far as I can see the DSA folks are

00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:43,660
doing an awesome job there's always more

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,970
things that come up whenever I've had

00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:50,290
any dealings with the team they've been

00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:52,090
very responsive very helpful there isn't

00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,790
really anything I can think of that I

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:57,210
want more passengers to say thanks guys

00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,210
you're awesome

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,960
[Applause]

00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,720
anything else

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:16,920
any other question so in that case we

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:20,610
can thank the speaker and we meet in one

00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:24,390
half hour for the next topic about exam

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:28,779
I think thank you very much

00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,779
