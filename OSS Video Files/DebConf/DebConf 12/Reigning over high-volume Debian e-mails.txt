	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,950
so welcome to this talk raining over

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,910
high volume dubbing emails by Parvati

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,130
l21 and go ahead hello

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,630
so we are here in Nicaragua where it

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:20,760
rains and we're we're talking about what

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:29,130
to do when you get you have a waterfall

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:31,560
of emails okay so this is a very very

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,899
short introductions before we go a

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,550
little bit around the room and talk

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:41,730
about how different people have

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:45,360
different ways to deal with the influx

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,800
of emails in Debian so the motivation is

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,930
of course as we all know the Debian

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,579
community depends heavily on emails not

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,160
only for personal communication but they

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,590
are key tools part of infrastructures

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,480
that are completely male based and I

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,280
have seen that over time most of the

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,199
Debbie and the contributors have

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,600
developed their own way of deal with

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:10,020
that and on the other hand at my let's

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,890
call it daytime job I work on machine

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,260
learning and natural language processing

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,869
and for for many many years having tons

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,960
of papers coming out saying you can use

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,759
this technique that technique to improve

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,880
person dealing with a lot of information

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,680
interestingly there are still not that

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,900
type of technology deployed on the field

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,490
and something I have learned from the

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,740
free software world is this concept of

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,240
well you work much better when you

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,579
actually work on something you you want

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,710
to use yourself that's so long the case

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,200
in science and I want to put it into

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,030
test by this so here I want to share a

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,640
tool I develop for my own use and

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,189
another tool that I wrote for community

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,320
use and embraced on with people whether

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,780
the tool I wrote come useful for other

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,479
people or you know but techniques people

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,860
use and we how can we improve it with

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,860
some machine learning

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:12,040
ha so the tool I wrote is has the the

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,780
name so far of listo smartmemory Liz

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,819
reader but the name is subject to change

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,730
when we come with a better name and the

00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:25,180
tool is a fairly simple tool you get the

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,519
emails coming in go to a regular mail

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,680
archive in M box format then you have a

00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:33,040
back end they use pearl and mailbox

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,400
thread and classify your DBA ZL and

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,940
populate SQLite database and then a

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,330
front-end written in Scala and formalism

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:46,180
Kali the next step echo

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,709
these are chosen because I really wanted

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,540
to use the tool and I didn't have much

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,340
time and I just went for the technology

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,989
I was more familiar with and it was

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,319
faster it took me like a week to put

00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:58,349
this together and using it so for a

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,849
while now I'm pretty happy with it

00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:04,600
although it has a number of shortcomings

00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:08,410
for for other people but take a look how

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,160
the tool looks like so here you have the

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,870
depth count discuss mailing list and

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,480
here you are filtering at a particular

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,670
threshold minus 10 that means you see

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,600
absolutely every mail that come in in

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,489
the last week on Def Con discuss that's

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,200
three pages of emails a hundred and

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,060
forty messages and here you have the

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:35,230
difference chorus and by the classifiers

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:36,579
so for example I don't play assassins so

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,650
even though they are not particularly

00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,709
bad emails I don't really care about

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,910
them so much and it seems I'm a really

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:48,280
bad person because I don't care about

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,630
loss cameras but if I then feel if I

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,069
don't have much time to read the emails

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,549
and I filter out score one point zero

00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:57,010
then that gets reduced to 29 emails and

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,049
well I'm very interested on this open

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:03,970
blog staff or maybe buying a debian

00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:06,010
jacket and so how does the classifier

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,599
works well when you click to see an

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,370
email then you have these buttons over

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,140
there that says well this is anime

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,720
will I call this an email I really don't

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,269
like and all the stuffs go to store it

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:21,579
into the SQLite database and classify

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:24,280
this training on that this is definitely

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:26,710
not rocket science the only work is

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,380
behind the data is the different schema

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:33,820
stuff I mean few tables with messages

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:36,280
and threads and how the message got

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,350
protected and suffered at the most of my

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,690
my work on building this tool wasn't

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,680
putting together the database schema

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:47,169
stuff at that and the classifier itself

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,820
I'm using that a classifier this pack in

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,710
Debian which I have used for other

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,610
projects and I highly recommended it's

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,750
very fast

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,340
it handles emails natively and it's more

00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,710
than just naive Bayes classifier is a

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,450
maximum entropy classifier they also

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,120
actually have used it to train a program

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:07,539
to play chess so it's definitely not

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,180
your run-of-the-mill spam detector and

00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:12,100
the way I use the categories is that

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,530
messages that they had marked plus 2 or

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,630
minus 2 are always used as positive or

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,830
negative training examples and then the

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,090
plus 1 and minus 1 are our samples so

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,039
basically we say something is plus 2 say

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,750
I always want things like this well

00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:28,780
something is plus 1 is like well things

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:32,200
like this I like and it also takes into

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,210
account emails you saw on the on the

00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,310
title by using even click to to choose

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:42,130
to open those are like mild negatives

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,410
and besides a classifier I also have a

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:48,810
little rule engine or you can write

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:51,250
actually executable Perl code because I

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:58,060
don't hang out with Luciano enough about

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:59,590
security and web apps that you can write

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,580
rules like say no if somebody says my

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,440
name I want this to have a plus 10 or

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,250
like one of the rules I have is things

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,789
that come from

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:13,720
Debian dot org in Debian de belem lists

00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:14,950
and should get a little push up that's

00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:21,870
because I don't know enough Debian

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:25,350
developers yet and and the UI is

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:28,320
it's a really really funny UI because

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:31,110
it's if you know that the very very old

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,669
Java UI frameworks swing did somebody

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,260
actually wrote something that you you

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:38,550
write code that looks like swing and it

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,050
renders an ajax app application and it's

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,330
really really ugly it's not the way to

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:46,530
do it but this is really fast the whole

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:51,330
UI is 500 lines of code and okay so this

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:53,460
is what I have and it makes me happy I I

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,770
still have issues for example I compute

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,729
all the threaded structure but I don't

00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:02,310
expose it on the UI and there are the

00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:05,580
main point and we were just talking with

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,820
a ver before here is to actually make it

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:13,229
use IMAP rather than mbox files so you

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:15,090
can do it together with another and the

00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:16,860
other things that the tool as it is

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,260
right now is really set up for for the

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,330
the machines where I run the UI in a VM

00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,919
and the backend in a different machine

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,110
and stuff like that so it's not really

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,760
that installable so I want to work on

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,169
getting operation that people can

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:35,310
install so that's one side and the other

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:38,700
tool I wrote is a hundred and fifty

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:41,160
lines of parole that handles it's a

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,919
bridge between the Debian user Spanish

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,820
mailing list and Twitter so you

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:51,690
subscribe to add Debian underscore yes

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:53,700
then you get for every discussion on the

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,789
mailing list that has at least three

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,940
males of which there are two different

00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:01,950
others that helps with spam detection

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:04,680
you get a twit and you only get once per

00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:07,139
thread so if you want to know what's

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,780
going on on the mailing list for eight

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,840
months is Casa generated around a

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:16,919
thousand tweets it's not a particularly

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,539
silent but it's definitely much less

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,900
volume that being subscribed to the

00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:24,240
mailing list and reading it every day

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:27,000
and so far it has got a hundred

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,550
followers which I mean justified for me

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,110
just to keep that boat running that the

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,169
boat is public domain you can download

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,400
it the link for downloading is Sunday on

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,900
the

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:42,110
account in a in a more serious aspect

00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:44,020
I'm a personal project of trying to

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,220
reproduce the kernel traffic

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,710
summarization for the Linux kernel

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,560
mailing list somebody for doing five

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,240
years every week summarized by hand all

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,470
the emails from the Linux kernel mailing

00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,260
list so and all those summaries are

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,850
available are GPL and we can use it to

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,710
actually build a system that can

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:08,630
summarize Debian develop that stage I

00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:11,300
publish a paper that a few months ago

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,640
and what I'm working now is in aligning

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,910
the original emails with the summary and

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,040
trying to derive rules of when you want

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,600
to include certain part that that's a

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,810
very well studied problem but here we

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,490
have very good data to work on that this

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,670
will be very very nice you you could

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:30,530
have people who are they be an

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,720
interesting Debian not developers and

00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:36,530
and read a summary weekly of what's

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,390
going on on Debian table and I mean if

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:43,580
we get to that point I will be a very

00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:45,110
happy pub when I started the smart

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,640
mailing list reader people point me to

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,990
this blog and I would really like if

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:55,040
more people write blogs like that so joy

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:57,890
analyze what makes in the thread

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,050
structure to be an interesting thread to

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,610
read so for example if you have in a

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,740
thread only two people going back and

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,980
forth then that's what he called take it

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,930
to private email or if you have the

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,340
thing if you have one person posting

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,970
something and immediately replying to

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,840
himself

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:16,730
does the thing before you post or

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,380
somebody post something and then you you

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,750
don't have no discussion you have just a

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:27,650
ton of responses to the same that's the

00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:30,370
blindingly obvious answer and so I would

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:33,260
like to add this type of identification

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,480
we get a comment from your see from

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,900
Kevin mark he says it would be cool to

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:44,410
have something that matches the weekly

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:46,450
news yep indeed

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:51,430
you will be when cooler if cab X was

00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:54,640
here but okay so that's that's what I

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:58,390
have I so now I would like to know how

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:02,560
you guys deal with the ridiculous amount

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:06,520
of emails we receive in Debian and your

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,480
own personal strategies in Python

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:14,620
Argentina the mailing list has a karma

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:18,630
bottom so you can set that that mail as

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,630
a positive or negative karma and it's

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:30,670
karma so you can fit about that karma so

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:33,700
and then you see just to post silly

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:37,890
things in spot karma and probably nobody

00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:41,170
gonna read it in the future so distant I

00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:44,230
I was thinking on similar lines oh yes

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,120
so bad to associate the karma you have

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,530
to go to our website and click a button

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:56,620
for that particular email how it works a

00:11:49,530 --> 00:12:00,150
link to to say very nice her what how

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,150
people will feel about that

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,400
Juhi is less nice on his he call it

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,310
cooks he says well if this thread has

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,980
too many cook too - good pasta ratio I

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:16,090
don't read it but that's the same bad

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:18,700
karma would be nice to have a karma

00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:24,910
system for emails that's just based on

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:27,370
the headers - thoughts about that so you

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,310
could reply with you could include a

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,020
karma header in your reply and that

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,820
sounds like oh wait but I don't

00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,440
necessarily want to reply to something

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,060
and then perhaps you shouldn't be

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,340
judging if it's not that important that

00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:44,200
you don't want to reply so the karma go

00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,330
for the person or deed goes

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,590
automatically text classification on

00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,590
that content on the email

00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:00,510
yeah he said that is on the person but

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:05,010
it could vary implemented based on the

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:07,170
text well one thing that strikes me here

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:10,020
is that yeah I understand for this kind

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:12,750
of feedback a the most usual interface

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:16,020
will be web-based however there's this

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:18,959
cultural issue in our community that we

00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,860
try we tend to avoid web-based interface

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,360
is whenever male based interfaces are

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,149
available so having a male available

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,810
interface to rate males I don't know

00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:34,020
could be strange but work better with

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:37,050
this group for these type of things we

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:39,750
have already have spam collect all

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,040
addresses that you can bounce spam to so

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,110
we could have positive and negative

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,260
karma bounce addresses that you just

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:49,830
bounce from whatever lists on Debian you

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:52,260
just bounce that's good that's bad then

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,480
you can have lists put some karma

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,990
experiments you think one thing I wanted

00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,029
to add is that in my experience to read

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,770
many many mails from mailing lists the

00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:03,510
good thing is to revisit the

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:06,510
subscriptions you have from time to time

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,329
and then somehow sometimes decide that

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,339
this is not worth the time and

00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:13,770
refraining from subscribing to every

00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:17,730
list it's also a good way to having too

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:20,040
many mates some sorry to get a very

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,399
clear picture in involves two mechanisms

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,529
one is replying with karma and that just

00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,079
gives karma to the to the thread not to

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:31,050
any specific person so some kind of

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,200
weight weighted average of the karma

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:37,380
with decay and but the other mechanism

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,089
would be rating people and that would

00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,720
involve addresses where you send

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:44,910
somebody's email address to that special

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,010
he was talking about bouncing so there

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,959
you want the whole email and we can use

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,990
the email text to do that or we can use

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,970
the sender whether to go text base that

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,800
it will be as you were saying for the

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,350
whole thread and append you can get

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,990
flame words and stuff like that or going

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:04,140
for people that's

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:07,170
most likely willing bowler very nice

00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:10,290
flame worth website I was sort of I was

00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:12,900
riffing on his idea and I mean I think

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,570
it makes more sense to keep the Karma

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,930
regarding specific males or threads in

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:21,360
the thread but the special address I

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:26,040
think would be very nice for giving

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,900
karma to people but the reason I have

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,730
this smart mailing list reader is

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,530
because actually it's not a matter of

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,180
karma I am interested in contributing

00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,620
natural language processing and machine

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,820
learning stuff to add a bunch of

00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,260
projects I'm not interested on

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,000
everything the projects come I'm only

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,110
interested if they say something related

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,330
to my field

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:45,330
so I'm subscribe to LibreOffice mailing

00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:48,840
list is a huge traffic and most likely

00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:52,110
I'm uninterested of like five emails a

00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,310
month at most so that's not not really

00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:58,680
that they are saying things that are bad

00:15:53,310 --> 00:16:01,410
is that I don't care there's a danger

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,220
with the parent sort of stuff that

00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:07,230
people who are not currently involved

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,210
can't get involved because they're males

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:12,000
when I get read because I don't have

00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,980
karma so I think this sort of thing is

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,330
really personal you should do it only on

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,260
your personal machine you shouldn't be

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:23,640
sharing the results with other people

00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:25,380
great I mean I I was really thinking it

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,920
about something personal and the other

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:30,600
part is I'm tired of Google knowing you

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,270
know everything I do and then I think

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,060
about this is you you keep all these

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:40,260
what you read and what you didn't

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:43,890
personal line and so I'm currently using

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:46,800
Gmail for email reading I would like to

00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:50,040
switch to this it sounds really useful

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,260
but the interface maybe needs a bit of

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:58,170
work in terms of the threading

00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:59,010
particularly getting if I can get more

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,590
people to help

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,420
I'm not a UI guy at any point in time as

00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:07,980
you can see the world language to

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:11,130
deserve this is written in scala but no

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,770
but in reality all you have is an SQLite

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,750
database that you want to serve

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,290
and you want to do you can do it in PHP

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:21,830
you guys with anything which you want so

00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:23,390
you could theoretically write UI in

00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,459
different languages yep

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,800
to the back-end all the stuff that you

00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,360
have and you can also write backends in

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:34,700
different language in as much as just

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:37,790
populate the same database so I was just

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,680
thinking about the no karma for unknown

00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,980
people and well you could certainly

00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,950
start unknown people at some positive I

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,870
mean be optimist it seems like a

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:52,270
relatively simple problem to solve

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,270
of course I probably miss the hard part

00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,320
III feel the Karman issue is more like a

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:03,200
thing that project should discuss rather

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,270
than a technology stuff so I'm fine with

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,190
whatever the people want to do what I'm

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:11,000
more interested is in the part of which

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,680
type of technology can help if we want

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,510
to implement a karma system based on

00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,950
text I definitely can help a karma

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,560
system based on sin there are some

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:21,580
people it's it doesn't need any NLP or

00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,890
anything like that it's just counting

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,020
maybe one thing to add is that we are

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,420
already having some sort of karma just

00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:32,600
for spam detection I mean we do already

00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:35,390
rank some mails below some threshold

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,430
based on their content so maybe we could

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,110
extend this spam detection

00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:42,260
I mean basically it's the same tools

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:45,520
yeah but karma pays for community really

00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:48,440
leads you to group think and to voting

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,080
to efficiently well not efficiently but

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,700
executive being voting on the people who

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,470
mail because you have more people

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,290
bouncing the same mail to either

00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:01,630
positive or negative so IIST

00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:05,170
I feel feel has something to say right

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:14,480
there was discussion along these lines

00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:19,280
in talk in 2010 star girls detection

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:21,230
yeah exactly and obviously nothing's

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,270
been done about it since it seemed like

00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,840
there are some quite good ideas that

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,309
popped

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,669
around that time so that you'd

00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:31,429
mechanically spot flame wars and then

00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:34,309
tag the the message that gave rise to

00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:38,779
that flame war as being flame bait and

00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:42,140
then use machine learning to spot

00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:44,390
similar messages in the future and that

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,360
if you did that if you provoked the

00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:50,059
filter you could put the flame bait on

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,070
hold for 12 hours send a message to the

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:55,250
sender saying you do realize you just

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:56,990
triggered the flame bait detector do you

00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,390
want to get the bad reputation that goes

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,279
with that or do you want to click this

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,710
link to get rid of the email and pretend

00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:07,130
it was never sent one of the nice thing

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:09,590
is that if you get people to adapt

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,690
themselves to write emails that pass by

00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:14,210
past the flame war filter but worry

00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,770
there will be no flame work because the

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:19,990
email will be too complicated to

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:22,190
understand that they are just flaming

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,890
and maybe another thing to add is that

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,690
we also have some sort of mechanism to

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,299
prevent film Wars in Debian that is

00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:31,100
named list masters and you any one of

00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:33,770
the readers of Debian level can report

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,919
anyone's behavior in the list to the

00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:39,470
list masters and they quite often react

00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:42,409
by banning for a certain amount of time

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,750
given if you I mean you have to make a

00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,460
case and give some emails to justify

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,470
that this person should be banned for

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,570
some time from the mailing list because

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,880
their contributions are not positive to

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:57,230
the discussion how often that happens

00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:01,250
though ask them like once one person per

00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:02,570
year I think my feeling is that it's

00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:07,580
more than that probably more than

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:15,080
something like around one per month on

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:18,190
all lists but I don't know so Phil how

00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,190
do you handle emails

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,190
that's the picker random person

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,250
well at the moment I'm not reading email

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:29,210
because my laptop drive crashed two days

00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:31,490
before Deb camp and I've been trying to

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,789
repair my not much database ever since

00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,880
and so I'm having a very very relaxed

00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:38,830
Deb camp and Dave comes out of seven

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,150
to email little while I've been here so

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,210
I didn't know what the day trip was

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,400
going to be and it's just great it's

00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,740
like a magical mystery girl but normally

00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:52,960
I use not much which is just really

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:56,260
fantastic it's not much of a mailer so

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,260
it's just a thing for indexing every

00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:02,200
mail you've got with zap Ian and then

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,850
the UI that's best developed for that is

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,190
based in Emacs which will piss a lot of

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:10,090
people off but you can some lunatic is

00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:13,720
done a vim version as well so you do all

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:16,750
your email within some mad vim mode you

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,190
can plumb it into mutt as well it would

00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,360
be kinda nice if the natural language

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,900
stuff you're talking about could

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:26,200
interact with that okay so the way that

00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:30,100
it works with with Emacs at least is

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:33,220
that you can apply tags to any any

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,170
message so you could have extra tags for

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,180
house spamming something is and then you

00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,460
can do searches across the whole text of

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,830
all the emails that you've got and you

00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,540
get the first 20 or so emails in about

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,970
two seconds even if you've specified

00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:49,170
quite a complicated search with multiple

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:51,040
tags and multiple search terms you

00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:52,330
assign back to yourself

00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,240
we are the mythical person who are

00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,800
scientists you saw in person you have a

00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,600
personal database with all the tags on

00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,580
all the emails that you've got but you

00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,930
you you actually back email say this

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:07,150
email bag well what you normally do is

00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:09,550
when you first get a new email you have

00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,590
a lot of rules about instead of doing

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:14,170
proc mail rules you have rules that say

00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,260
if it's to me then add this to me tag

00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:20,020
okay and if it's list one of these lists

00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,330
then I'll list tag and then under these

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,590
circumstances remove the inbox tag so I

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,920
never have to see it and I'm not

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,810
searching for it okay that's the way I I

00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,660
try to make it so that as few things

00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:34,890
land in my inbox even though that's

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,390
actually not the folder that exists so

00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:40,450
that those are the mails Lyautey try and

00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,980
read and then other males if someone

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,270
refers to something you can search for

00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:47,350
it really quickly and then find the

00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:49,130
thread and sometimes when the thread

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,510
keeps on coming back from the dead

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:55,580
like you know the tempeh fest thread or

00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:57,500
well the system thread I tagged one of

00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,750
the messages in the thread as killed and

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:06,890
then I never see that thread again which

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:10,549
is rather nice very relaxing anybody

00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:13,130
else so just a quick follow-up thanks

00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:16,880
Phil I'm glad you like not much also

00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,830
there is for people who hate who think

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,010
that reading email in an editor is

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:25,130
fundamentally a stupid idea there is a

00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:30,140
python-based curse and curses interface

00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:32,840
called a lot which I know puns are one

00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:36,919
of the great trials of the not much

00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:40,780
community that should be uploaded to

00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:47,780
Debian pretty soon so it's nearing

00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:57,620
production readiness I guess the tagging

00:24:47,780 --> 00:25:00,770
script I use is called a few just yeah

00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,179
it's kind of about not much a couple of

00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,289
times and it sounds really good but I've

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:06,409
never quite worked out what it was that

00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:07,730
I had to do to get it used so if you're

00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:10,880
not much guy that was a really useful

00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:13,490
piece of information so what do you use

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,799
to handle email to yourself I just use

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:20,480
mud okay and all my email lives on a

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,250
server around the net so I get the same

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,240
IMAP view of everything everywhere

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:27,799
doesn't matter which machine m on except

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,020
for at work where of course they've got

00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,030
exchanged and so work mail just kind of

00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,789
goes in a bucket that I ignore mostly I

00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:38,480
look at it once a week and discover I've

00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:40,730
missed a meeting but they wouldn't allow

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,770
I'm mapping arm until last year we had

00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:46,240
to and and so now we

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:49,760
can actually read mail real mail so so

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:54,049
how much time a day you spend reading

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:57,640
mailing lists most of it okay I don't do

00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:57,640
much apart from read and write mail

00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:14,630
I spent some time recently looking at

00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:18,300
the use of the IMAP keywords for mail

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:21,030
instead of using folders at the moment I

00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:25,650
just automatically filter everything

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:28,050
into folders with prop mail and I use a

00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:31,980
variety of mail readers like on my phone

00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:35,490
I starve thunderbird on a Windows

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,900
machine and plus a web interface with

00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,740
squirrel mail and so I started looking

00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:44,520
at if I could transition from folders to

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:47,160
using the keywords there are two

00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,650
problems I found one was simply that not

00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,270
all the clients support the keywords in

00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:54,900
the same way and that was going to be a

00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:59,340
pain and the other problem that I found

00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:04,050
was that synchronizing the keyboards so

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:06,450
the keywords that each client that I'm

00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:08,940
currently aware of needs to have a local

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,310
list of the keywords and you need to

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,860
manually enter them into the client so

00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:16,020
if you have a desktop and a laptop you

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,560
have to set up your list of keywords on

00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:21,180
both of them all your custom keywords

00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,060
you know I couldn't find any simple way

00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:27,660
to synchronize that between all my

00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,920
clients so that that's as far as I got

00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,650
and it just seemed like I didn't have

00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,260
time to to go into it to actually find a

00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,060
solution but the thing I liked about the

00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,290
keywords is you can have multiple

00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:43,500
keywords and you can declare like views

00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:46,530
basically instead of folders and that

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,530
can provide a lot of sophistication for

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:51,540
managing email and also to manage it in

00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,730
in different times of the day like you

00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,700
could say during business hours

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:59,640
my main view might be focused on my

00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:02,160
business email and outside business

00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,990
hours you might want to exclude business

00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,280
email whether it's from a folder or

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,929
whether it's on your private email

00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,240
address or something else

00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:11,679
you can tune that a little bit but there

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,570
are those big stumbling blocks that I

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:20,139
mentioned before I could get to that

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:23,860
point and in general how do you deal

00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:28,330
with so much email for Debian in this

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:30,369
and so on you're off work hours how how

00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:33,039
do you manage to go through that you

00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:36,490
just go and look at all the threads and

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,710
choose to participate in some at the

00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,289
moment I deal with it very selectively

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:44,259
so I only look at things if I'm very

00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:46,929
actively interested in the subject so

00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:49,179
when I join a list I set up a folder for

00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:52,600
that list I set up a rule in proc mail

00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:54,909
to capture everything that I receive on

00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,759
that list and I won't even look in that

00:28:54,909 --> 00:29:01,749
folder unless I'm participating in some

00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:03,490
thread and one consequence of that is

00:29:01,749 --> 00:29:06,009
that people often have to say see me

00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:08,230
privately to wake me up to look at

00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:14,110
something especially if it's after a few

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:17,230
days yes I mean I did something very

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:18,850
similar to most of that actually is Exim

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,619
rather than proc mail to do filtering

00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,570
and I found one problem was that I used

00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:24,490
to filter all my Debian stuff into a

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:27,009
Debian bucket the problem was it was

00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,779
very hard to get bug mail to end up in

00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:29,740
my inbox and not in the Debian bucket

00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:32,980
because they're being booked he didn't

00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:35,169
get looked in very often and I kept

00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,490
failing to write a rule so important

00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,159
bugs would Mulder for three months

00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,629
before I noticed that stuff was broken

00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:42,820
which is kind of embarrassing so you

00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:45,100
wanted personal emails to your Debian

00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:48,879
abscessed to go to your inbox not to

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,320
your exactly at the moment various

00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:52,360
things broke on the service everything

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,249
is just going to my inbox which means I

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,409
noticed things much more naturally

00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:58,929
replying which is good but you get more

00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:02,769
mail in your inbox that was something we

00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:06,129
were discussing with Zumbi this at

00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:09,119
breakfast that some classifier that will

00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:12,490
detect email that in a sense is

00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,080
addressed to you it's quite important

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,610
it's not as trivial as it sounds because

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,590
if you are having a conversation in a

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,400
mailing list then they are just

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:21,200
addressed to the mailing list

00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,590
so then you have to know that previous

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:30,290
history and you replied or you started a

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:33,730
thread maybe you add to the things that

00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:37,100
can be done to read mail effectively is

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:40,970
also not really technical rather how you

00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:43,730
manage your time I have found several

00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,620
times that if you start just reading on

00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,900
the background your email you end up

00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,270
doing nothing but just go and refresh

00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,980
your email to just see if by mistake

00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,240
something happened and some Debian

00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,490
mailing list ooh

00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,560
it didn't and five minutes later you

00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,210
just try again and oops it's didn't and

00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,120
then you spend a day long

00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:05,240
refreshing folders so nowadays I have

00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,170
the opportunity to commute in train so I

00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,570
have 40 minutes

00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:10,430
offline and I usually think before

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,590
entering the train and assign these 40

00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:15,760
minutes to do this and when I get out

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:18,980
then it's done or not but it's done and

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,920
it's mostly a matter of assigning time

00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,220
and just to detail my technical solution

00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,280
I have several accounts that I think

00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,980
using offline him up and when I they

00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:34,010
enter a tough cut they re parsed into

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:36,260
dovecot and filtered using sieve you may

00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:38,630
a map extension and then they are piped

00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,640
it into different folders the advantage

00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,620
of this is that if you don't have your

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,210
computer you can go to the web mails of

00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:48,140
the source thing and they're already

00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:50,300
filtered so it's quite a nice solution

00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,430
it has some drawbacks and sometimes off

00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,820
line him up just crashes for one of the

00:31:52,430 --> 00:32:02,960
folders so just log in to restore it

00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:10,400
from time to time but sieve is actually

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:13,810
protocol to define filters for I used of

00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,370
cut of cuts has something to do this

00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:19,250
it's quite tricky because it you you

00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:21,190
have to resend the Mail's to dovecot

00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:25,300
when they arrive through off lining up

00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,300
which is quite ugly but works

00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:49,300
run that do you wanna share your email

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:53,320
life well over the last year's a more or

00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:58,270
less started to not follow emails too

00:32:53,320 --> 00:33:01,750
much I'm I'm more catched up the habit

00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:04,150
of following rse and that worked out

00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,790
pretty well and people are throwing

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,860
pointers around anyway on I receive and

00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:11,590
something interesting going on in the

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:15,880
mail so that works for me most of the

00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:21,730
times I'm still playing math user and

00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:23,970
have some prop mail file filters but the

00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:30,460
thing that worked out most for me is

00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:34,540
coloring emails in not depending on who

00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:36,610
is sending it or other reasons here but

00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:47,440
the what you were mentioning we could

00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:50,100
use a button on hash Debian developer

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,230
inning data for for email categorization

00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,750
okay every time somebody post there some

00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:57,460
email at some link to some email and on

00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,230
the archives and you say okay well this

00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:05,830
is really news worthy people are talking

00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:09,190
about it no so about half the time those

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:12,700
links are posted as an example of a bits

00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:14,710
of human behavior so people shaking

00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,500
their head like that it's like oh my

00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:21,130
goodness I can't believe what so-and-so

00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,290
just posted so which you could also use

00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:25,950
for a part but you have to differentiate

00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,950
somehow

00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,490
come on you you you keep track of all

00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:39,280
the deviant mentors emails how will you

00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:42,220
do that I think I said before that I'm

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:46,330
using Google Mail okay just for the

00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:49,030
lists whether you do you use their

00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:54,520
importance training system the you know

00:34:49,030 --> 00:35:02,980
a skim or read every thread how much

00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:05,890
time do you spend way too much okay well

00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,930
again that's also another thing that one

00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:10,330
can do besides inscribed ring from the

00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,710
mailing list is blacklist threat once

00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,540
you have spent too much time you can

00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,910
just decide any contribution to this is

00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,860
just too much and I don't care and then

00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,080
well every mail will just be tagged as

00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,900
read by your mail client so it's quite a

00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,370
good way to avoid noise and avoiding

00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:44,380
noise is good because what you want is

00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:46,900
information you know something important

00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:50,860
in any one of those folders and and not

00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:53,860
know it's there and I think that that

00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:57,790
email as it stands doesn't really give

00:35:53,860 --> 00:36:00,610
the sender a lot of options to to

00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:03,340
emphasize what their message is like

00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:07,090
some messages like an invitation to a

00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:09,340
party probably a lot more important

00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:14,290
before the party then then after the

00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:16,300
party so this would be a vital clue that

00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:18,580
was actually if their email reader had

00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:22,120
some way of knowing that after a certain

00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:23,340
date this message is meaningless so I

00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,930
think there are a lot of opportunities

00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,250
like that that could be explored I mean

00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:30,130
one option is to send

00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:32,710
calendar invites instead of regular

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,990
emails and that might fulfill some of

00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,930
that but maybe there are more specific

00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:39,130
things that could be done

00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:42,370
you know for things in the Debian

00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:45,150
project particularly relating to bugs or

00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:47,710
or other things that to help the

00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,140
recipient to prioritize because

00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:52,120
otherwise you just have a long list of

00:36:50,140 --> 00:37:10,450
things and you go through from start to

00:36:52,120 --> 00:37:12,010
finish the the issue with the that's

00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,660
that's something that could be done like

00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:17,490
for somebody a discussion about than a

00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:20,200
bag and the bag has been closed then

00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:22,450
your email we could have something that

00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,210
that marks that whole thing is no longer

00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:28,330
relevant so that's a very good point and

00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,860
a little Deb come for example that there

00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:32,890
is a lot of emails at are time dependent

00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:36,610
and can make a big difference

00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:40,510
I mean just to continue that suggestion

00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:43,090
one idea would be if I'm maintainer and

00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:46,930
I'm responding to a bug report and I

00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:49,060
want to say to the reporter look I'm not

00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,950
gonna close your bug report without

00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,200
consulting you I'm giving you a week to

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,450
check if I fixed your bug but if you

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,850
don't close that about yourself and

00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:00,640
confirm I'm satisfied in a week it's

00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:02,650
gonna close automatically it would be

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,230
nice for me to actually be able to

00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,660
emphasize with that email they have to

00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:10,510
act on it and then their their email

00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,550
program would somehow emphasize that

00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,830
this is an action that they need to take

00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:17,770
rather than just an email for them to

00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:19,330
read then they can still ignore it I

00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,400
mean they're not forced to read my

00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:26,340
emails but if you could give them an

00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,340
extra clue that would be really helpful

00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:32,740
yeah that's something that can

00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:34,450
definitely be add to dead bugs you can

00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:38,910
send an email like like something like

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:38,910
delayed closed or something like that

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,190
okay so do

00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:46,680
people feel they would like to help with

00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:59,369
these do you have some friends that are

00:38:46,680 --> 00:39:02,010
good at making you ice so I just wanted

00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:04,020
to mention one more not much related

00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:09,060
item which is that we've been

00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:13,170
experimenting with sharing tags for the

00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:14,849
purposes of patch tracking and it's a

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,730
really simple scheme and it's not tied

00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:20,550
to not much it's just using a get a

00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:23,750
shared git repo that we push to and then

00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:27,180
we grab those tags and push them into

00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:29,880
there not much database but so something

00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:33,180
along those lines maybe with a different

00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:36,270
UI could could be useful for us for some

00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,280
of these schemes as well where you work

00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:41,130
in a distributed manner and people make

00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:44,880
some determination about messages and

00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:48,599
then you do conflict resolution via via

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,060
some version control system now that's a

00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,740
pretty techie system so it depends how

00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:57,200
techy of a system you're willing to

00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,200
tolerate but it seems to work ok for us

00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,970
some of those tags can also be assigned

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,970
automatically

00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:12,369
okay so I guess we finish a little

00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:15,160
earlier thank you so much for coming in

00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:17,050
spite of the rain and look forward for

00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:21,810
there comes 13 with some better

00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,810
