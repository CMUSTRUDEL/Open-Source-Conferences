00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:51,340
last year we were in Bosnia and started

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,140
organizing that that conf twelve these

00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,090

00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,070
defconn's i don't know if norman do you

00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:05,580
want to tell something about the bit and

00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:11,560
the process earlier I was a bit oh yes

00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:15,400
this whole thing started around 2008 I

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,540
think when a friend of ours attended

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,459
debconf 18 bar de plata he came to

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,340
Nicaraguan he was very very excited he

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:27,760
said oh that conf it's so nice and so

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,280
nice people but we will never have a DEP

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,450
convince Central America that will never

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,190
happen never this friend of our is Rene

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:44,769
my organ

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:47,920
please Rene eat your words so we did a

00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:52,470
kind of warm up with in 2009 with the

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:57,330
Central American Meetup we had in esteli

00:02:52,470 --> 00:03:02,410
it was not a big event like debconf but

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:07,060
was quite nice we met Kuna wolf

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:12,010
mr. guna goofing in Esteli and he it all

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:15,850
as he convinced us to to do mini debconf

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:22,050
in Central America and so we did in

00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:26,440
Panama in 2010 yeah hey one very say one

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:30,640
ever one of the organizers of the mini

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:33,370
dot-com back then so we went straight

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,209
away for the big thing euro Nicaragua

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,569
and

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:41,200
yes we wanted to organize that they've

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:45,400
been confident so we started to work on

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:49,359
the bid we weren't able to travel to New

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:54,370
York so mr. Gore wolf kindly presented

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:57,909
our bid in New York I don't know if he

00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:01,750
was very convinced that that was a good

00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:05,469
day idea but so we started working with

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:10,510
Norman and envelops and many other team

00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:12,220
members preparing the bid yes

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,319
I think it's worth mentioning that the

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,130
bit is completely was it completely a

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,320
different proposal that what we are now

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,910
is pretty funny so we really changed

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,680
everything

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:28,539
but I think to the better they presented

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,520
the video walking from the hotel to the

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:32,800
venue you may have noticed it not

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,289
doesn't look anything like that if you

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,949
go to low mighty Scapa and there you see

00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:41,470
an ugly pyramid shape body of I don't

00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:43,479
know what that was to either venue we

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,000
are everybody who's seen that it's very

00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,860
happy that we're finally here at not

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,500
only are we saving money and getting a

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:58,180
much nicer venue but a but well I mean

00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:00,090
it's a all for the message generally as

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,509
an experience I would say that

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,889
organizing a Def Con Finnick Aragua is

00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:07,930
hard because a lot of things that in

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:11,380
other countries you would be like usual

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:16,030
or common to get can be difficult to get

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:18,159
here or really expensive but we have

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,690
internet we have a venue and we have one

00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:22,830

to really be able to link their faces to

00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:45,510
their identities so you sign a real a

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,180
real personal connection and not just

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,640
the checking of an ocean national ID so

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:55,230
