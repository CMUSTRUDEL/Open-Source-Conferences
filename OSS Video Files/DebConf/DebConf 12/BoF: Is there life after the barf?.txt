okay welcome everybody this is the life

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,410
after barf bath and for folks who are

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,049
interested I encourage you to come up

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,910
and sit with us here because it's going

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,840
to be a discussion and we'd love to have

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,939
your input or your thoughts so if you if

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,960
you like I'm not gonna twist anyone's

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:28,619
arm but we have open seats so ganar is

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,410
going to be leading the discussion okay

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,380
thanks well I have some points here I

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,469
don't really know what what what is

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,399
achievable with this session I hope we

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,950
can get to something well I'll first

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,950
just state the status although I know

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,160
several of you are already quite aware

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,030
of it a Penta barf is the system we're

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,539
using to organize that come since to

00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,820
2007 it's a very complete very well

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,350
wide-reaching

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,970
conference management system which you

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:10,920
have consistently hacked beyond what it

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:14,310
what was originally a part of it so it

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,400
has some good things a that cough is as

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,770
far as I know I mean as first have been

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,869
to the most complicated the conference

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:27,360
to run because we keep a many we we use

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,299
many factors that were that are not

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,970
usually needed for most conferences for

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:39,930
example all this workflow about rating

00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:42,810
requests for a travel sponsorship or the

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,810
assassins game or whatever that are

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,909
tracked in Penta so right now yeah it's

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:53,340
completely completely unique to us

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:56,909
yeah a the the problem is that well with

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,640
have many arguments recently a we have

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,369
we tend to leak out of pentacles it's

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,180
very hard to well to manage several

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,970
details with it we ended up using the

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,060
wiki for many things that should be able

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,650
to be stored in a database in ways that

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,150
will give us a

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:21,659
richer set of information and the

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:25,319
ideally should be easier to use and to

00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:29,129
understand yep the best point in Penta

00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,920
bars is that it's very very it has very

00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:36,659
low hack ability this means it's a pain

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,780
to work with a I see several people who

00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:45,599
have touched it in a past and I think

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:49,409
nobody in this room likes it or or would

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,889
voluntarily want to work with it more

00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:54,720
than more than what's needed the thing

00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:59,400
is the logic of Penta is too twisted

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,480
there are many points by which something

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,980
can be defined

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,120
I have spent 30 minutes wondering that

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,510
how does a string of text get to the

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,840
users yes and the the things are defined

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:19,199
in very different places all over all

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,319
over a we were just having an argument

00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,780
because by fixing something yesterday I

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,109
broke something else and well aganetha

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,780
knows this system better than any of us

00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:33,810
here but he couldn't attend and and he

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,510
cannot be like like in charge of

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,599
everything so if only gannis is able to

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,239
understand the working of pen tars well

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,229
I think that's a weak point of the

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,859
software a it's too complicated to

00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:52,530
install on a Darian system a a Ganesh

00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:55,049
again outright told told me a and they

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,299
told a also Victoria when he tries to

00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:00,150
join that it was impossible but we

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:04,560
shouldn't even try so we have access to

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:08,909
one a test system called Cletus and to

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,579
the live system called Skinner yeah but

00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:13,349
I mean I cannot do much work

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,760
disconnected I cannot test anything

00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:19,949
because I don't have a local install and

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:23,010
yes the testing system is almost useless

00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:25,800
because it's on a very slow machine so

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,900
slow that that it takes ages to connect

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,460
it takes ages to

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:34,610
anything so to be honest I do some very

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,430
minor hacking on my computer and against

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,880
all good practices I do most work on the

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:45,110
life I instance so if during that camp

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,240
you have periods of penta pages giving

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:52,570
you proxy errors it was because it was

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,570
restarting my fault and yeah that's it

00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:01,760
then an important part of the well the

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:07,400
complexity of it right now of the of its

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:09,410
database status is it's very

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,690
uncomfortable to work because we have

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,910
split things in many different

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,039
namespaces some of them are part of the

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:20,590
original design but for example we have

00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:23,870
many tables called debconf dot DC

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,910
underscore something why because we

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,729
wanted to keep the code bases a

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,919
synchronism with a upstream well

00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,110
upstream development died so there's

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:36,770
nothing to synchronize with but we have

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:39,800
a separated namespace which makes things

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,560
very tiresome to write and very

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:50,320
error-prone and I am an expert in

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:54,500
committing errors so well the thing is I

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:58,210
I proposed this both so we I mean we

00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,650
will quite likely and with earlier a

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,990
because I think there's no much

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,570
discussion to the fact that we need

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,150
something different something new

00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,810
something used elsewhere something but

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:15,289
but but we have to get a get out of this

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,930
problem I think strategy a leads nowhere

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:21,139
yes stop bitching stay with Penta love

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,449
Penta the only way we're keeping Penta

00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:30,490
is to train a monkey because this monkey

00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:33,740
is out now the

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,280
we have valuable information in there

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,230
six conferences which have all the

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,990
attendees that all the comedy event

00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,580
which are each of the talks and many

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,710
information that surrounds it

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,770
part of it is not very important like

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:54,370
again this course of two years ago a

00:06:48,770 --> 00:07:00,350
game of affair of assassins okay but I

00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:04,370
mean we we were suggested to take a look

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:06,650
at something called fraud which is used

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:11,780
by some previous users of Penta and has

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:13,880
a series of logic to import from a life

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:17,630
print a Penta bars instance into frappe

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:21,590
of course it would only import the base

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:24,200
stuff so the names of the people

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:27,200
involved I mean the user accounts they

00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,240
the events but it will not import

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,250
anything that says they've got specific

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,520
which is very important to us to keep

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,370
for example we we went the the

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:42,170
conference rated a that the travel

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:45,020
sponsorship ratings because a for

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:50,600
following years we can refer to previous

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:52,880
years information so I think migrating

00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,560
completely to fraud is not an option we

00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,820
have to keep the Penta instance arise

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,640
and we have to I mean to keep

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:05,410
information there so so we can still

00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,410
look at the numbers say

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:13,830
with a stable URLs and all the historic

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:18,240
information we could on once on one hand

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:21,210
a pull everything say by a very

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:26,250
permissive W get we would have some

00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:29,400
problems defining a private and public

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:35,960
information so I don't think it's very

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:39,270
likely but it could be done and a well

00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,510
the other alternatives that I tend to

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:45,630
favor is just to keep paint as it is

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,990
right now we will only have to provide a

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:51,630
server to keep to keep running with

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,720
current versions because it will not

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:58,800
work with wizzy because it depends on

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:02,880
very many Ruby in drink assets which are

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:06,870
changing for wizzy and install something

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,620
new something from fresh so well this is

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:14,610
basically what I have as a structured

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,589
presentation I'd like to know well some

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,690
input from you and I'll try to take

00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:21,750
notes here of course this is a gobby so

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:26,570
you can all connect and I'll help me

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:30,060
make this into something more useful is

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:34,050
so well please tell me if if any of you

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:37,800
has any thoughts about this also is

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:41,580
anyone on line on hashtag Kampf talk

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,100
room - okay are you are you willing to

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,670
relay comments if people ask them to be

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,670
related Thanks

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,910
maybe to start with the kind of boring

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,380
bit about old data before we all rant

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:02,240
about our own favorite conference

00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,410
systems it would seem possible not agree

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,450
in the short-term the most sensible

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,010
thing is just to keep Penta running it

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,920
would seem like it might be possible to

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:12,470
dump out some of the data from table

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,370
levels up front by doing queries which

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:20,620
dump out power user stuff we care about

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:23,720
kind of thing and put that in some

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,460
appropriately permissioned place so that

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:34,400
we don't need so that we don't keep

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:36,950
Penta going for 20 years or whatever I'd

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,320
also like to ask the possibly heretical

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:46,880
question of just how much we really need

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:48,170
the vast majority of the data yeah most

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,500
of the data is completely unnecessary

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:54,710
for example bank account information is

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,810
hasn't been used in Penta for a while

00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:03,970
but it still exists from years where it

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:07,310
was used and certainly most of the

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,480
there's very little data we need and a

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,430
lot of it has gotten out of date like

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,140
people's addresses for example if they

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,000
last attended in 2007 for example that's

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:18,380
irrelevant so I I completely agree the

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,140
we only need a few specific things and

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,610
those of us like going out or me or

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,470
anyone else who has done Penta hacking

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,150
in the past can figure out some way to

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,370
export it if we go somewhere else I

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:31,700
would be curious what other options

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,160
there are independent of export from

00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,180
Penta for conference management software

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,350
that we don't have to be the upstream

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,690
for yeah well just to on your specific

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,790
point I know that bank information was

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,920
purchased at some point I don't know if

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:49,390
it was say requested again later I don't

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,610
remember that but but I think yeah a

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:55,880
what you suggest they also may it make

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,280
sense a on a different way a the thing

00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,350
is I want to separate the problem of

00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,310
migrating to something else I want to

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,770
install something and then

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:07,500
they may have time at some point to take

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,480
that out but for example we don't want

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,060
to break the urls that they are already

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,430
pointing to our information that can be

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,510
even if the data is hurry is easy to get

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:20,880
it can be hard to to get it in the right

00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:24,089
structure just to add maybe on the data

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,740
we want to migrate away we we have lots

00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:28,950
of information about past talks

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,000
including slides I mean we already have

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,040
video elsewhere

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,200
but I mean keeping these slides and

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,900
stuff for future reference still is

00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,360
interesting which just have I mean we

00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,980
can very well goat in any other system

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,170
but there is valuable information that

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,150
you should just not lose in fact one of

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,220
the things have mentioned to potential

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:50,700
sponsors is that well if you have your

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,830
logo in our system look we have 11 years

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,800
of a past conferences information there

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,750
so it has a high permanence yeah I think

00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,460
I mean there's basically two parts of

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,260
the Penta stuff which also applies in

00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,450
fact when we're talking when we start

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,360
talking about possible replacements one

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,790
is the kind of what most conference

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,800
software focus is focused on of dealing

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,480
with torques and events and that

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,030
obviously we need we would need to have

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,760
some maybe in the longer term some

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:20,970
static dump of all the Penta information

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,110
on the same URLs the other part which

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,260
actually we spend a lot more time

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:28,470
fussing about is the per user data in

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,970
there and yeah again I mean I agree some

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,589
of it is just not needed and probably if

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,690
you kept Penta running for a few years

00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:36,330
dumped out of information as you needed

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,190
it then after a couple of years you can

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,350
say well too bad if he doesn't need it

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,420
yet then it's probably not there's some

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,730
of the data that is there we should

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,440
actually be using more and because it's

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,730
in Petra and tricky to get all data we

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,830
don't at the moment so even things like

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,440
travel sponsorship I think there's been

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:55,080
a fairly low usage of whatever happened

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,430
in the past partly because it's tricky

00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,279
to get an imp enter and partly because

00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:00,900
it ends up being dumped into other

00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:03,720
things that are not Penta because Petra

00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,690
is tricky to use so even just having a

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,760
dump of this stuff in a version control

00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,200
repository or whatever that was given to

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,360
the appropriate people probably mean

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,040
more use rather than compared to the

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,020
moment rather than less

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:27,410
just one just want to mention relate

00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:29,150
from IRC from Eric I think is a talk

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,830
scheduled talk data links to videos etc

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,540
which would be exported to a static site

00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,160
since it's never going to change again

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:40,370
and it didn't be so you don't have to

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:43,010
remember what I said well when I think

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:45,380
we arguing about how to export is

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,450
something we can leave it for later the

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,610
thing is we need to start acting as soon

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,730
as possible on the replacement yeah

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:55,070
because yeah that's something that will

00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,900
we'll start worrying about in March but

00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,940
in March we cannot change the conference

00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,400
management system so we have to do it

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,350
early the good thing is that next year

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,660
we'll go to Switzerland so everything is

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:15,950
already planned a by the way there's a

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:19,430
planned network outage for Saturday okay

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:22,790
so a one thing that Mori suggested also

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:25,220
I think we should look into it a the

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,380
number of workflows we currently handle

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,470
and that's a big part of this mess it's

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:33,560
very big maybe we should split into

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,900
several linkage systems and the the

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,600
amount of information shared is very

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,430
little so for example if we take all the

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,220
volume tiers and video stuff and

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:46,279
somebody works on it we just have a

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:49,520
single sign-on thing that also goes to

00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:52,550
attendance and goes to events a I mean

00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,589
receiving talks and receiving papers to

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,990
a different place we will have many

00:15:54,589 --> 00:16:01,190
simpler solutions instead of one big one

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:03,680
one bigger solution I'm not entirely

00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:08,330
sure that it ends up being simpler so

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:13,970
for example the video team needs to have

00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:16,250
very there so they've got the volunteers

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,930
that they have our conference attendees

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,260
so they need to be hooked into the

00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:24,170
attendee system they are working on the

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,329
talks and that means if the talks change

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,249
they need to be immediately updated

00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:29,509
so it's if we're talking about spilling

00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:31,579
two separate systems seems like we're

00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:36,259
defining we'd have to define a number of

00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:37,670
interfaces but in practice you know I

00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:40,040
feel like if we're gonna need to run the

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:43,309
same kind of complexity of course we

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,949
have to we have to I really analyze this

00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:47,209
say this project just to sort of explain

00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:50,660
where I'm coming from and that point

00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:51,920
maybe I would rather that there is exist

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,069
some system out there that does

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,069
everything we want that would be great

00:16:55,069 --> 00:17:00,889
my point is more that I'm pretty

00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:02,600
skeptical that that's true and I'm

00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,939
pretty skeptical that there is any

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,949
system that does our registration part

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:09,199
in a way that really fits with what we

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:11,089
want because I don't know of any other

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,589
conference with her at all

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,329
which users interested in using free

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,699
software for their stuff which is at all

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:22,789
similar in their registration levels

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:25,339
part I realized that it would be ugly to

00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:28,159
all of us as geeks to have two systems

00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:31,250
which don't interface as they should but

00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:33,620
I also one I am not yet convinced

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,240
whether that ugliness is worse than the

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,279
ugliness that results when we start

00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,279
hacking all our weird registration stuff

00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,500
into someone's elegant existing system

00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:44,720
because right now we have what we were

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,130
what's in paint and what's on the wiki

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:53,000
so we already are having this overloaded

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:58,909
yeah I tried to look into some of the

00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:02,029
alternative but this week I have kind of

00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:05,210
a frappe instance running but it didn't

00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:07,220
get it to have port that is actually

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,399
accessible from the outside for others

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,770
but and I hope to move that but when I

00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:15,649
that's not the point the point is that I

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:19,610
saw in front as I looked at it that it

00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:22,130
just does talk and nothing else so no

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:24,620
registration for participants I guess

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,679
that's true for others and I had a short

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:30,950
talk with Worland about this and he

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:35,600
proposed we might try to adopt what they

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:38,960
use for UDS which seems not completely

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,000
unreasonable and if we manage to go the

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,580
political side

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,740
of this and yeah it's somehow tied to

00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,170
launch pad but it was not at least not

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:53,140
clear how much work it would be to rip

00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,660
out the launch pad part because he said

00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:59,050
it's just used for authentication but I

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,480
didn't look at the code at all so but we

00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:05,100
could investigate this - there's a page

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:08,110
if you do a Google search that has some

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,650
kind of a list of open-source conference

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:14,770
management systems the only other option

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:19,410
I found there that seemed somewhat

00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:21,430
reasonable to use was what Linux call

00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,580
Australia uses they have their own

00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:30,100
system and they might be somehow a bit

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:36,340
similar trust and lean linux con i you

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:38,680
and um this is also the only one that's

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,290
written in tyson and the others are

00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,720
launch the launch the UDS one is also in

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:47,830
tyson the frappe is in ruby and at least

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:50,590
my ruby knowledge is non-existent so I

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:53,830
think if we Cove it crap we really need

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,580
someone that knows Ruby on Rails or he's

00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,380
willing to learn

00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,440
yeah well that was a point I was going

00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,990
to get to it later because well for

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,030
example I am a ruby person I'm willing

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,670
to learn other stuff have never written

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:09,670
Python but I think we should form a team

00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:12,520
to start to start hacking as early as

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:15,460
possible Jimmy I found the list from

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,990
2010 from May 2010 of congressman

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,350
conference management systems I added

00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:22,360
the link for the yarn and Gabi there are

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,270
three that it knows of in Python

00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,070
including what Linux conf au uses that's

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:32,140
apparently called zookeeper with only

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:34,030
two E's and there's also conman which is

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:38,440
used by the Utah open-source conference

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:40,480
and Texas Linux fest and also scale reg

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,220
which is used by scale and there's a

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,320
couple of other ones you can see on that

00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,800
link so we could explore these if we

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,540
need more options now I wait because I

00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,360
have a question here from a long time

00:20:49,540 --> 00:21:00,410
ago I think that whatever we do

00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:06,260
what what sorry sorry I'm a able to give

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:09,950
to him later a the a when one of the

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:12,230
problems we've had with Penta is trying

00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,120
to keep in sync with upstream

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,190
development really slowed us down

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,860
because we have to do all kinds of

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:22,250
safeguards not to invade the upstream

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,410
namespace I think that whatever we

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,450
choose we will deviate I know that

00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:31,130
sounds terrible from a free software

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:35,990
user point of view but I don't expect we

00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:38,570
can integrate as maybe we can if we we

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,240
find something truly modular I

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:45,110
understand your points but I think that

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:55,100
having it modular really can can work

00:21:45,110 --> 00:22:00,010
well in that sense but let's see caleb

00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:03,350
hace el flew in formation the Penta get

00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:08,800
the base and the information flow of

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:12,680
Penta is already there for quite a poor

00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:15,740
web form Ilario database the user

00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:20,240
interact by a web browser through which

00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:21,190
three forms and to say like the que pasa

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,850
aqui

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:29,540
it was a we come on ons sa na dhih so ok

00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:32,620
he said I said that a ok we can migrate

00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,620
to something different

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:39,680
Kazumi laughter eeeh the new person has

00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:42,140
to assume the new tasks pero con

00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:45,800
cervando look at the asset but keeping

00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:48,050
what we are currently doing una tarea la

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,460
vez Scylla del

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:56,150
y'know nas hotei we delegate one task at

00:22:52,460 --> 00:23:00,590
a time instead of doing it mario server

00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:02,690
he tried y'know a saying panda new users

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,570
will not register in paint anymore but

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,580
in a new system I see it as a piranha

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,890
wondering

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,940
de que nos a consult us information sin

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,800
well no sistema

00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,930
so Penta gets a flag that that

00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,660
information is no longer to be used but

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,320
the other day new one a lentil process

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,890
of parole

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:24,190
it's it may be a slow process no a in

00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:29,800
English the poor Spanish oh okay it's a

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:32,380
no a the Penta Penta could be just

00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,870
frozen and forget about it no new users

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,900
there no new information there we will

00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:40,540
start with something fresh and we will

00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:43,780
not care about it so what is already

00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:48,880
invented stays invented as it is at

00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:52,090
least from my point of view maybe when

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,850
one other thing to add is that I think

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,250
that everything that is user related is

00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,590
in the end a list of fields with

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,380
specifics and I think that's probably

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,570
the easiest part of Penta even if you

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,640
can add travel sponsorship labovitz it

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,920
right it's still a set of user fields

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,380
that has to be expandable with specific

00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,830
formats and stuff the three key things

00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:16,870
is the video management the talks

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,880
assigning roles to talks and reschedule

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,520
talks assigning that to rooms and stuff

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,420
and I mean if we need another system to

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:29,230
just care about the user content then

00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:30,940
just yeah just er maybe you repeating

00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,050
myself but the bit that we have problems

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,050
with at the moment is not really the

00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,910
tork system and I think I agree it's

00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,110
sensible to go to a new talk system

00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,360
that's more up to date there's maintain

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:43,390
preferably and I would I would still

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,890
have a hope if we did I agree I or a

00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:48,100
different way I agree with your nose

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,690
point if we are trying to if we do try

00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,090
to do everything in one system we will

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,490
doubtless need to fork it and fate

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:57,310
effectively maintain our own system mice

00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,980
again my point on the kind of well I

00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,330
think modularity is a too fancy word for

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,890
what I'm suggesting I'm just so yeah I

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:07,690
was only suggesting having more than one

00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:09,970
system but if we did do that then though

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,070
I would be more optimistic that we

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:14,200
wouldn't need to fork the individual

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,570
components that we could find something

00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,980
that does what we want even I mean it's

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,110
possible for the registration part we

00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:23,110
would actually just end up taking a s--t

00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,280
that ask users questions tool and

00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,200
plugging in our registration questions

00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,420
it doesn't need to be a conference

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,860
management system as such but at the

00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,630
moment the thing we have the far the

00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:34,480
most problem with in Penta is this

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,429
dealing with user information I'm trying

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,190
to get it actually given to us in a

00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:40,840
valid way with consistent choices by

00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:44,020
certain dates and really I don't think

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,520
any system we find this no system we

00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:52,650
find is gonna be ready for what we want

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:55,630
in that I just want to point out that

00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:59,110
there is another one that is used by

00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:02,410
python that it's already handles the

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:05,740
sponsorships and hotels and and the

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:09,400
conference part is called symposium and

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,840
it's obviously made in python so i put

00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:19,240
it up you can the thing isn't scroll it

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:21,520
down okay so from the group of people

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,280
that are here that i know we're far far

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,820
from the whole universe is anybody

00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:31,679
interested in hacking the new system in

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:34,480
first working what to start with then

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:39,070
release it do part of the programming on

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:42,400
it we have a potentially interested in

00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:46,780
doing okay so we have at least one two

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:52,780
three four five six seven eight nine

00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:55,570
people yeah so a I think that the next

00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,760
step then would be maybe to open with a

00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:02,610
mailing list to start handing these

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,610
separately under the DEF CON for girl

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,490
should be quiet in the next few months

00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,980
anyway sorry the team list should be

00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,960
quiet in the next few months anyway yes

00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,460
it may be a there's a possible advantage

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,700
to just using that list so that other

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,410
people don't forget about this yeah but

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,130
it will reach many people who are not

00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:27,090
interested in this so a it will drive

00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:29,919
this subscribers away

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,030
we can just set up a list for this I

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,149
think I do think that there's something

00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:35,099
to be said for

00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:36,869
having the people who are not working on

00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,849
Penta but who have been working on other

00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:39,929
parts of the conference be aware of some

00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:42,690
of the decisions that are being made

00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:47,519
right so if we say oh actually we're

00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:50,989
gonna slough off front-desk stuff the

00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,989
front desk folks might want to know that

00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:17,960
you're being captured okay and of course

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,960
a wiki page everybody needs a wiki page

00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:28,559
okay I also I feel I think it's pretty

00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:30,509
clear that we do need to diverge right

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,769
from any other I don't I don't actually

00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:34,440
think there's any disagreement in this

00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:35,940
room that standard conference system is

00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,469
not going to suit our purposes because

00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:45,359
our conference is different from every

00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:46,889
other conference so but you know we're

00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,179
gonna be building from free software

00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:49,830
components we can it's not like we're

00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,799
we're ditching we don't think we need to

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,450
feel bad about that and and I and I

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,489
think that we should approach it from a

00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,989
point of view of what can we what also

00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:59,700
can we contribute back and how can we

00:28:57,989 --> 00:29:04,049
build these interfaces in a way that is

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:05,129
reusable for other people I'm not at all

00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:08,159
worried that we're doing something

00:29:05,129 --> 00:29:10,320
unethical by that is purely that I worry

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,849
about as requiring to always have people

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,039
who are going to carry on maintaining

00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:16,589
this thing for Def Con if it's just a

00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:18,119
def con piece of code we'd have we've

00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,799
had problems with that for Penta and

00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,289
although there may be a more initial

00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:24,899
enthusiasm for a new system in another

00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:26,339
six years time well in fact the same

00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,839
problem and there's a there's an

00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:30,839
important point in what you say

00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:34,440
regarding what big a Gaudin say brought

00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:38,369
up well we're building a large group but

00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,649
when we decide it will be in Python

00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:43,589
there those who don't understand Python

00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:46,169
will be driven away or whatever language

00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:49,169
you choose or whatever infrastructure so

00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:51,179
but let's try to use widely use

00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:53,879
infrastructure so we're don't run out of

00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:56,249
programmers so and I also think we

00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:59,340
should try to avoid the not invented

00:29:56,249 --> 00:30:02,129
here champ yes and then I'm still hoping

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,409
to find something that has kind of a

00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:07,499
plug in infrastructure where we just

00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:09,720
could plug in our custom things and hope

00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:12,480
that the API doesn't change too much

00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,749
over time so we can upgrade to the next

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,169
version without rewriting everything but

00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:20,879
that's wishful thinking at the moment

00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:22,350
just to kind of count although I'm being

00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:24,239
still pretty skeptical and I said I

00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:31,350
should counter part of my point are that

00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:34,259
part of the issue is also about the UI

00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,759
of penta mm-hmm a lot of the user issues

00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:37,950
and a lot of our hacking has been to try

00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,340
and make the UI less terrible for people

00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:45,029
registering so it's also plausible that

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,950
if we start from a newer system firstly

00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:48,659
if as long as it has some flexibility

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,330
and as long as the UI is not quite as

00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:53,249
bad we may need to do less divergence

00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:58,139
even for that user registration part

00:30:53,249 --> 00:31:01,019
anyway one thing I wonders though with

00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:04,710
the team we just build is that it makes

00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:07,499
I mean it's made of many people that are

00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:10,379
already deeply involved in the bian and

00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:12,899
or in that conf and that will have not a

00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:14,970
plenty of time on their hands and the

00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:17,399
risk is that we just end up next year

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,590
using Penta again because the work was

00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:22,440
not sufficient and maybe one thing we

00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:24,389
could also do is say okay well this is

00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,429
the absolute thing we need and then

00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:28,769
everything that we can do in addition to

00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:30,989
this is just good if we if it's their

00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:33,929
own time and maybe we just we should

00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:35,580
also say well if on the third 31st of

00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:37,619
March we don't have anything that

00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,440
handles the video and the talks then we

00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:42,539
just use Penta and then we just stop the

00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,090
work because we have enough work for the

00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:48,960
next step confident yeah but I think

00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:51,480
that leads us to prioritize in what

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,590
which order will things be done I think

00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,899
for example if we are a in December and

00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,340
we still don't have any calls well we

00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:03,490
have to make the user register

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:07,030
and talk submission in March we could

00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,950
start doing the video in fact the video

00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:12,100
controller as it was used for the first

00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:19,390
time was written in two days during the

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:22,390
camp say so well we have to see the

00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:24,790
components and they prioritize them not

00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,590
only in importance but also in when are

00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:30,670
they needed the video controller is

00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:33,760
never used outside of conference dates I

00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:35,920
was thinking what he said about not

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,260
having the other system ready for the

00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,450
next that comes that's a possibility but

00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,490
I don't think we should dump the process

00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,380
just because it's not ready I think we

00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,170
should keep working on it and eventually

00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:54,880
when it's ready and people is happy with

00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:56,680
the new system just replace bender and

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,210
another point about the horribleness the

00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,460
current system which is not unique to

00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,310
Pantera at all but as a thing to bet we

00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:06,070
should think about for the future is

00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:07,330
we've a lot of parts of the data have

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,390
been done in different ways in different

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:12,280
columns so if you go into the admin

00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,530
interface use even for an individual

00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:19,120
field you're tending to see kind of 20

00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:22,420
different output is four or five of we

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:26,320
have three fields called day trip they

00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:29,650
trip option they trip a day trip should

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,140
pay two of them are boolean one is a

00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:35,200
reference to an outside table and what I

00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:37,030
would hope that we can try to do well

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,800
what is it what would be important to do

00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,810
if we want to avoid this problem in the

00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,130
future would be to in the same once

00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,770
we've kind of settled down in a piece of

00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:47,140
codons or in parallel with that try to

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,620
look at all the things that happened

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,330
over the past n Deb comps and try to

00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:55,330
design a sensible scheme that would

00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:57,220
support all of those flows without being

00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:00,730
or a sufficient subset of them that we

00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,470
care about right so that because I mean

00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,480
just defining a single ideal thing won't

00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,370
work we've got to have some flexibility

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,950
there but equally I think if we

00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:10,780
supported most of what like 80 or 90% of

00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:12,220
what's happened in the past few years we

00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,460
could also try to be stricter in the

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:17,020
future on not creating new

00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,420
variations on that and say well too bad

00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:22,480
it's with everyone if we've managed to

00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:25,860
run and Deb comes in this way then you

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,860
can probably run another one in that way

00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:36,280
okay so I think we have enough working

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:42,880
in our hands I think it can be time to

00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:44,770
close the session I think long term it

00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,660
would be nice to have the discussion

00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:48,460
continue on the mailing list but I'm not

00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:52,240
sure if it wouldn't be better to have

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:55,320
another meeting of those that show the

00:34:52,240 --> 00:35:01,030
interest here to have the possibility to

00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:02,950
do at least some decisions in person

00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:06,850
because I think it would you know I are

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:13,330
seeing no here interest here so that I

00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:15,910
just think it would be more efficient I

00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:18,820
also thought that the session is not yet

00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,110
over we've got eight minutes I think it

00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,450
would be really useful to come up with a

00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:25,240
list of things that we need next so for

00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:27,040
example here's a list of the critical

00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,470
data that needs to be that we need to

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,170
care about or here's a list of how we

00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:34,120
think it could be broken down or here's

00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,460
a list of the tasks that the penta is

00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,980
critical for whereas not so critical

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,180
tasks some kind of I mean I'm not saying

00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,800
to actually answer all of those

00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,990
questions in in eight minutes

00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,020
but I'm suggesting that it would be good

00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:49,690
to come away from this saying whoever's

00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,250
gonna work on this next here are here

00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,870
are some things that they could create

00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:59,050
you know documents that they could write

00:35:52,870 --> 00:36:00,340
up analyses they could do so if we can I

00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,950
see we're already starting this which is

00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,840
great if we can list in those eight

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:06,580
minutes list those requirements I think

00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,880
one good thing to do would be to split

00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:13,150
up the task of evaluating any existing

00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,770
systems to use as a base and then you

00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:17,500
know between now and a future session in

00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:19,210
person or on IRC everyone look at

00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,580
whatever system they've been assigned to

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,070
investigate in like email a report to

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:27,430
some location about its suitability for

00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:29,049
us to use as a base

00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:32,890
in light of the requirements of tech

00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:41,589
cons okay doesn't have to be email

00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:43,150
disclose a report in some location this

00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:45,249
type of list clearly needs some

00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:47,529
prioritization of course of course

00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:49,599
I was just dumping some ideas and some

00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:52,569
somebody's thought it was a good idea to

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,490
dump ideas from our mire see Eric just

00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:56,140
mentioned that Richard our scripts are

00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,490
probably worth mentioning yes we either

00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,759
need to preserve those or keep that

00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:06,069
functionality somehow right yes so very

00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:07,809
important is historical yeah one very

00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:09,849
good thing about pentamer that I've

00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:12,549
never managed to fully understand is

00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:16,390
that every transaction ever made to the

00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:19,539
database is locked so we can always find

00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:22,210
out when somebody did something that's

00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:24,880
done via PostgreSQL triggers it could be

00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:26,410
added to something else without the

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:36,579
application needing to know about it

00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:40,739
assuming it's in PostgreSQL I'm not sure

00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:43,239
anyone is suggesting to use MySQL so hey

00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:48,569
but the skewer light is very easy to set

00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:48,569
up and it's way too easy

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,900
well it's good so well I mean we have

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,359
200 users not 200 thousand users I mean

00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:04,059
it's not a high load system anyway yeah

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:08,200
but penta barker until runs with 17

00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:11,200
years as if I'm not - he's taken don't

00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:14,890
ask me why but yes some processes are

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:18,269
slow so some processes tie up our given

00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,269
instance for minutes

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:38,869
I'm sure Christian would disagree

00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:57,809
talk reading is both there's a rating

00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:00,420
for submissions and then there's a

00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:04,019
rating for how the talks went and I

00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:05,549
think those are very distinct systems by

00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:07,829
the way it's open already

00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:13,130
for this year in Penta so we can start

00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:13,130
rating speakers on how the talks were

00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:33,830
if we make international

00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:35,990
internationalization low-priority it

00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:40,690
will never happen either the system is

00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:40,690
designed to be internationalized or not

00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,850
and don't forget that for this type of

00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,550
at least translations we have several

00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:51,050
teams for almost all languages in Debian

00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,850
that would marry that would be very

00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:58,730
happy to do the translation of the

00:39:52,850 --> 00:40:00,980
DEFCON 4 system whatever one thing maybe

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,350
that wasn't mentioned that would be the

00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,150
advantage of having multiple systems is

00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,970
that despite the fact that we have to

00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,800
design interfaces and stuff we might use

00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:11,090
something in python for users because

00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,590
it's very suitable for this and

00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,910
something in rugby for video for

00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:16,040
whatever because it's more suitable for

00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:18,380
it and then the interface can happen

00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,500
over the database typos accessed blah

00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:23,780
blah blah or whatever else and it might

00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,300
be an advantage of having specific

00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:28,040
systems that are very suitable for users

00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,170
and a system that is very suitable for

00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,990
video and then having just a clearing

00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:36,320
clearly defined interface so is any of

00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:39,260
you familiar with how the Debian single

00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:44,800
sign-on system is designed we may use

00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:48,680
something Shibboleth yeah I think it is

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,210
Shibboleth I'm not sure but I mean we

00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,040
couldn't use the Debian single sign-on

00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:55,220
because we couldn't have participants

00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:59,030
from outside of course no no but using

00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:01,160
another instance of that seems like

00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:02,480
pretty big overhead but I would be

00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,340
willing to look I'd be willing to look

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,980
into the authentication system because I

00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:10,220
mean I have written single sign-on

00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:14,810
system for web complex things they

00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:18,860
usually suck after a bit but I mean what

00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:22,220
if we do what you say using different

00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:25,040
bits of interest infrastructure per team

00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:28,130
which makes sense yeah sharing a data is

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:32,450
a good way to do it and we need the

00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:34,940
authentication or web whatever I'm also

00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:37,160
not sure if a really real single sign-on

00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,560
in the sense if you sign on to one

00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,600
application you're actually signed in to

00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,290
the other one too or if it's just enough

00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,570
to have

00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:47,600
same login and password everywhere

00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:49,610
synchronized yeah well I think it makes

00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,220
sense for something like Penta to have

00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:56,690
one user account that would be in the

00:41:52,220 --> 00:42:00,500
central part and a a flag it as active

00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:02,450
for different tasks but sir that's not

00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:10,370
single sign-on that's just synchronized

00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:15,020
accounts in my sense okay so the times

00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:17,390
out so a just following do you think we

00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:23,660
we should have another life meeting

00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:25,310
before Def Con sober I kind of think

00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,200
it's a reasonable one level but also I'm

00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:29,450
it depends if some people are gonna have

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,150
time to do anything before then mm-hmm

00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:34,700
which some of us are unlikely to

00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:36,950
including in our yeah I'd love to have

00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:40,460
some time for I think it's at least

00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:42,200
reasonable to just gather to see who has

00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,990
knowledge on what technology is and

00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,480
probably can also together assess the

00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:50,030
system's existing so looking through web

00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,120
pages looking at the code if it has like

00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:55,550
plug-in infrastructure but it does and

00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:57,440
just assemble at least to have a start

00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:02,960
and to get to know each other so that's

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:07,280
mainly okay okay so proposed Thursday

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:09,890
after everything at the pool a bull at

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,910
the pool Thursday in the evening at the

00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,910
pool after dinner okay

00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:23,540
after dinner there's the Thursday after

00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,540
dinner thank you very much

00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,820
