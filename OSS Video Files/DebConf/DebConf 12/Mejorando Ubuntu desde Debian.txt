I didn't expected this audience today

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:16,890
and thank you well thank you thank you

00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:19,529
and well I didn't prepare myself to to

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,199
give this talk in English or I don't

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,810
know if you prefer to I do it in Spanish

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:31,470
or or if you will understand that in

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:34,610
Spanish but okay well I will try to to

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:40,350
do it in English just for yourself and

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:42,469
my wife over here and well my name is

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,079
Jose Davila who's Ernesto Davila and

00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:52,379
I've been collaborating with the Ubuntu

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:55,020
project for about five years and we

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,210
started the Ubuntu local team in

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,100
Nicaragua here and one of the first

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:06,119
members of the local team and I have

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,220
been collaborating in packaging with

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:14,640
going to for about one and a half year

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:18,689
and I found myself in the and the needs

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,810
to to submit some fixes and bug fixes

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:27,840
and to Debian and that's why I'm giving

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:30,930
this talk today and okay I have a quote

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,720
from Mark Shuttleworth and the founder

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,070
of the winter project then Ana Debian

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,950
developer and he said once that every

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,750
Debian developer is an Ubuntu developer

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,850
because the best way to improve the

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,310
wound - or collaborate with the wound -

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:54,659
is to is to collaborate with Debian and

00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:57,210
I have read a couple of lot of blog

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,409
spots from some Debian developers and

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:05,219
one of them is Rafael Herzog and who

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:07,590
have joined the the wound - community

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,610
even though he expresses himself that

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,030
all the technical improvements he does

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,220
will be today

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,920
and he was accepted as an Ubuntu

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,790
developer and and everything is going

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,090
it's going fine and and he has a nice

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:29,350
very nice block blocks post in in where

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,990
he explains what he did and well the

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,870
content of my talk is is about three

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,240
subjects and one of them is the

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,920
relationship between a boon to Debian

00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:45,430
and then how can you collaborate with

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:52,209
their being from a boon to and then we

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:55,150
have a some time for questions okay so

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:59,560
let's see how is the relationship with

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:05,459
within boom - and Debian well devyani

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:09,610
it's the the rocks we're open to sit and

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:14,970
David it's a rock-solid operating system

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:18,459
and the there are a lot of of

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,310
contributors that are volunteers the

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:23,260
they don't receive a salary they don't

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:27,220
have a payment for collaborating with

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:31,239
with Debian and Debian it's well known

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:37,360
for for it for a strong commitment with

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:39,540
the free software philosophy and Debian

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,680
free software guidelines it's well known

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:48,370
around all the free software communities

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:53,140
and we're going to use an operating

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:56,860
system based on Debian its imports most

00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:01,330
of its packages from from Debian at the

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:04,870
beginning of its release cycle and we're

00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:08,350
going to have predictable and frequent

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,890
releases we have a release everything

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:15,900
every six months and every two years we

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:21,549
have a long term support released and

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:24,160
and a difference with Debian we want to

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:26,800
receive the the collaboration the

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:34,919
support from a company called can

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,919
nickel which which offers corporate

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:48,400
corporate support for the for the

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:52,449
distribution and well another difference

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:57,099
between 1/2 and and Debian is the there

00:04:52,449 --> 00:05:00,159
are in 1/2 there are some a team of

00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:04,479
developers call it the the Ubuntu core

00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:06,969
developers who worked 24/7 for for a

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,120
wound today get paid for that but not

00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:15,610
all the not all the developers are are

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:20,830
paid they have some volunteers call it

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:26,259
the master of the universe and or more

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:29,280
to for for short and well how can we

00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:35,340
contribute to today we I'm from Ubuntu

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:39,509
well at first you can forward but

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:43,960
reports and patch patches that fixes box

00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:47,440
from a1 to do today bian and you have to

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:53,620
be sure and check double check that both

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:55,750
are fixed applies to Debian and and all

00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:00,729
the stuff you have to do it by email the

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:02,650
Debian bug tracking systems works from a

00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:04,990
series of comments you have to type in

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,870
the in the content of your email and

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:11,529
that sometimes it's not that friendly

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:14,560
especially well I have myself found

00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:19,210
reading the demanding us every time I

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,849
have to feel a new bug and and well for

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,690
new people are not well experienced in

00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:32,199
in this topic this can be a little

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:35,710
tricky but well to make this more

00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,990
friendly for the developers we want to

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,670
create a package called the it went to

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,890
dev tools where you have a serious

00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,500
of scripts that help you interact with

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:50,890
the Debian bug tracking system and you

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:53,510
can forward patches or to the BTS if the

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,400
if the packages are ready in Debian

00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,530
because sometimes you have package that

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,770
exists in Ubuntu but they are not in in

00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:04,580
Debian so if the package is in Devon you

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:08,780
can use the submit to Debian script to

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:11,090
to forward all the modifications you do

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:19,460
with to a Debian package to the Debian

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:24,110
BTS so that is what what the this this

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,700
script does and and you have a couple of

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:32,090
things to keep in mind when you are

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:34,850
forwarding box reports to Debian and you

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,100
always have to mention that you you are

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:41,600
testing this fix or your test your found

00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:44,230
this the bugging in Ubuntu and you have

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,880
to double check as I said before that

00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:51,500
that the fix or the bug applies to them

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:55,990
in and we have some obligate obligatory

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:58,610
rating for this and how to report bugs

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:04,910
effectively and there is the link where

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:10,090
you can read that and well another way

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:13,400
to to improve we want to friend Everest

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:17,150
to upload new packages to Debian and

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,550
this is the general rule now in the

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,260
winter community every time you say hey

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:25,640
I have a new package and I want to

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,780
upload it to whom - they the developer

00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,730
says ok

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,370
upload it to Debian and we will sink

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:37,040
this to - into the next release cycle

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:39,200
and and as I said they the new packages

00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,729
once objected in Debian once they are in

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:47,530
the in the dev in archives you have the

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:49,760
the want to get the the packages

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:53,000
automatically at the beginning of the

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,560
release cycle and the first alpha

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,160
release I think

00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,970
and then you can request to sink or

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:10,730
March the packages when the diving

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:14,120
import fries get in in time and I have

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,910
found that a better way to to get new

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,270
packages into Debian is joining and a

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:22,820
Debian packaging team right now I am I

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:27,170
am part of the Python applications

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:30,200
packaging team and and well I have been

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:32,330
interacting with the with the team to to

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,380
get the package I maintain in the diving

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:38,150
archives and it's well I I think when I

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,190
started to collaborate to diving I

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:43,970
thought that it's gonna be hard

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,790
partly because I well there is always

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,760
the we will talk about that later there

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:54,350
is always the the the idea that we have

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,750
an intricate relationship but joining a

00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:02,330
packaging team is is the best way I

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:07,760
think and like I say we have to kill the

00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:13,040
troll and because there's two people

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:15,589
thinking that Devin and we want to have

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,380
a stormy relationship a very strong

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:21,740
relationship and that isn't that it's

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:30,770
not the case there are well we have a

00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:35,589
Spanish audience now okay

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:39,650
but I will continue in Spanish for our
