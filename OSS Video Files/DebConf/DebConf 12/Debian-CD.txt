so next talk is Debian CD by Steve

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,500
McIntyre you all know him I guess W CDs

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,809
portable release process and source of a

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,330
lot of discussion over the years are we

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,470
feature complete what's missing what

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,210
should be doing in the future

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,070
what what hi folks again this is a talk

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,099
where I want you lot to join in as well

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,599
I'm not just talking at you if that's

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,080
what you're hoping for this is going to

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,080
be very short

00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:40,309
so Debian CD is a large ugly lump of

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,590
pearl and shell and God knows what code

00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:45,660
it seems to work give or take we've been

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:51,180
producing lots and lots of CDs for many

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,710
many years it's most of its the vast

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,520
majority of what I do in Debian these

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,559
days you might have seen there's been

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,160
some discussion literally in the last

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,540
couple of days about sizing of CDs

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,720
they're just not big enough anymore

00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,340
we've had long-standing issues for a

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,350
number of years now just physically

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,840
trying to make sure that we get a useful

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:22,530
gnome or KDE desktop on to CD one we're

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,259
working on it Weezy is possibly either

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,140
going to be the release after we managed

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,210
to make that work or beetle if not it'll

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:36,689
be the very last one I think I'm quite

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:41,159
confident to claim that how many people

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:44,280
we got here not a huge number as out of

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:52,320
interest how many people here use Debian

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:55,439
CDs for installation yes okay how many

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,570
people here use CD images that we create

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,680
whether that's on a USB stick whether

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,310
it's on a CD or a DVD or anything okay

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,610
cool

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:13,500
right we have some users awesome of you

00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:16,140
lot does anyone use CD one or KDE CD one

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,550
again either on a night either on a USB

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:24,750
stick or on a CD or a DVD or anything

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:30,959
hands up one and a half two and a half

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:33,780
oh is that another one the back oh do

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:39,239
you use KDE CD one or gnome CD one at

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:42,750
all the first CD okay that's cool that

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,400
white so maybe I'm over maybe I'm too

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,360
worried about this and actually we

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,629
should just not bother with them anymore

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,720
we'll see the issue that we have with

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:58,019
all with always with the CDs is Debian

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,989
is for forever growing physically trying

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,940
to get a usable desktop on CD one used

00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,300
to be easy back in the demoness and pass

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,750
we fit a minimal gnome and KDE on the

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,250
same CD these days we're looking at

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,560
somewhere between one and a half and two

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:26,280
CDs to have even a minimal desktop

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:28,080
you're given noodles the microphone the

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,709
main question I haven't seen answered

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,010
anywhere is how many people only use CD

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:37,170
one how many people only burn that

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,959
single CD never connect to the network

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,700
never burn another CD and therefore

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,379
would actually be disadvantaged by us

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,909
not having it anymore and that's a piece

00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:50,000
of information I know we've had that

00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:54,590
kind of discussion offline a few times

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,569
and it's very difficult to get an answer

00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,599
we it used to be that we would cook we'd

00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:02,939
we do conferences and things and we

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,530
would do a CD one giveaway or we'd sell

00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:06,060
CD one or whatever

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,110
and we'd expect that it will be useful

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,569
for people I keep on being told being

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,209
assured that actually still doing CD

00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:17,609
sized media is useful because of people

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,019
with really bad neck connectivity either

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:20,940
cuz they're in the third world or

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,570
because they're living in backwards

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,850
Tennessee like Joey or whatever you know

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,730
Anna knows those situations actually you

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,770
want to have a single CD that's useful

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:35,910
it's approximately impossible to find

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:40,410
out exactly what the numbers are I wish

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:50,760
I knew more Daniel well

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:54,570
microphone just to clarify yeah what's

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:57,660
the element of risk if we have an iso

00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:00,600
image that's just a bit bigger than a CD

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,180
it's like a DVD it doesn't fill the

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,970
whole DVD but obviously it's optimized

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,880
for people to download it like if we go

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,160
from 700 up to 900 make it well exactly

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,590
that's one of the options the abun to

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,340
folks have just done that their first CD

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,140
isn't a CD anymore the debian live

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,330
images that we've been shipping for the

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,960
last couple of releases are too big to

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:27,300
fit on us on a single CDR again this

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,300
comes to exactly what the focus should

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,370
be I could be quite happily convinced

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,229
that we do net inst and then don't

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,590
bother with CD sized images the next

00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:39,479
world should be DVD I guess we have some

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:45,390
support for that what what do other

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:47,880
people think okay Miguel reckons the net

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,830
instance dolls too much yeah he's he's

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,590
either widowed that's not a lot less to

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:58,910
him yeah I was gonna say something

00:05:52,590 --> 00:06:01,050
similar to your proposal i I think I

00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,360
like having that intent business card

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:07,220
because sometimes if I can't if there's

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,220
Network issues during the install or

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,260
reboot but that's a separate side

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,960
discussion so III think it would also be

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,090
useful to

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,490
[Music]

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:21,870
or to sort of work on making it easier

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:24,699
for people without network to obtain USB

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,460
thumb drives because even optical drives

00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:29,620
are becoming scarce or netbooks and if

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,479
you are in a situation where you don't

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,610
have network or you're having a network

00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,270
connectivity issue like only Wireless

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:40,090
and no firmware or something you may

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:43,960
want to be able to give away USBs like

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:47,050
the conferences yeah absolutely so of

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,360
course again since squeeze both the

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,820
Debian's CD no the installer images and

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,710
the live images are hybrid so you can

00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:58,000
literally just dump them at least for

00:06:53,710 --> 00:07:00,430
x86 oh I know I 386 namely 64 that works

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,770
for other architectures I have no

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,660
freaking idea how to boot off USB to be

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,090
honest I don't really consider that a

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,940
major issue just yet one thing I should

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:13,450
have said please someone or ideally many

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,199
someone's please take notes in gobby we

00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,030
have this up

00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,330
I'm not taking notes because I'm I'm not

00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:22,770
try not to look at the screen no that

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,770
doesn't mean I want lewd messages either

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:32,070
so yes it's a possibility that we that

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,360
we could just stop doing CD sized images

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,820
what we've done with the other tweaks

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,530
are happened post squeeze but is

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,080
happening regularly with the weekly

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:44,410
builds for Weezie is in fact that the

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,310
DVD sized images well they're not quite

00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:51,070
the first for the first DVD in the set

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,190
is deliberately limited down to exactly

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:57,940
four gigabytes so that that sort of GP

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:59,410
bytes so that will fit um I was what I

00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,650
was right first time four gigabytes so

00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:04,419
it will fit on a four gig USB stick that

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,229
being actually probably more common for

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:10,660
most people than using a DVD or for it

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:13,539
if we did consider we don't care about

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,729
CD sized images anymore it's also

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:19,570
entirely feasible that we could then say

00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:21,520
let's have a two gig first image that

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:24,580
you can blow to a DVD or you can put on

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,300
a on a two gig USB stick obviously we

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,840
don't want to have a 1 2 4 8 16 32 set

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,840
of options

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:38,820
but I think maybe a one gig maybe a two

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,760
gig one gig right now would cover what

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,660
we need for KDE and Gnome so we could

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,240
carry on with the same setup we have to

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,100
would possibly fit both I don't know I

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,490
haven't run the numbers these are all

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,490
options again let me know what you think

00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,330
at the back Mike

00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:16,380
oh well I'm from Salvador a I live there

00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:20,400
we do sometimes Debian events their job

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:23,680
when people come to us and they want

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,710
their installer we usually burn a CD

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:31,620
because that's the most easy way to

00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:35,110
install it and from us I think it's a

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,570
necessity to have a city that includes

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:42,010
all the the desktop environment for new

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:47,100
users and to use the desktop the Debian

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:49,839
desktop more easily that's a comment ok

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,850
and we got videos well I mean the other

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,520
option is if CD wall isn't big enough

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,350
for gnome and KDE then we could just say

00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,630
you need the first three CDs or

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:02,050
something so there's an interesting

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:05,500
question does it work better for you for

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:09,430
that to be a Debian installer style CD

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:13,890
one or is a live boot CD that you can

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,890
then install from an even better choice

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:25,600
well it worked for us that there be any

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:33,490
standard first because they already seen

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:36,070
the desktop in the event that's ok so

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,490
sizes is still an open question please

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:42,940
follow up notes here mail little WCD

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,700
less Debian developer Agron Daniel yeah

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:50,160
I've had a play with the live CDs as

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:53,910
well recently I found it quite useful

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,230
I've actually said I made up some CDs in

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,230
Europe and posted them out to Australia

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,940
to South America to various people they

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,830
all got them going instantly it was a

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,020
instant success they dug out old

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,660
machines and put them in

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:10,450
so there are use cases for these things

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,520
but the question is not so much the

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,180
technology I mean we can do all these

00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:18,700
things if we really want to but maybe

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,340
the question is more about how

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,190
to get a bigger survey than just the

00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,900
people in this room sure is that where

00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:29,410
we should devote the effort right now

00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:31,600
it's if you have suggestions on how to

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:37,150
get more information out of our users

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:40,120
please mail me I've tried talking to

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,170
various forums Linux user groups

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,540
everything already

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:48,790
and unfortunately the feedback you get

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:52,950
is approximately zero download

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:56,500
statistics are possibly the biggest

00:11:52,950 --> 00:12:00,880
thing we're missing in Debian is we can

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:03,070
get proportions of downloads from some

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,590
of our mirrors but we've got we have

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,270
very little information to go on for all

00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,460
of the many many mirrors we don't

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,700
control and of course we don't know how

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,800
many times a given CD might be used you

00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,290
know an individual download could then

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,060
go to an install fest and 350 machines

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,600
or it might get thrown in the bin and

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,840
never used once it's it's a huge amount

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,840
of guesswork

00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,610
regarding the option of having multiple

00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,940
City for special use case where people

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:39,270
want to install offline what about

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:43,360
having a first CD which is dead tensed

00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:47,710
with the standard package which is about

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:51,970
250 megabytes yeah and then second CD

00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:55,050
was just gnome that would be one

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,370
gigabyte almost again it's an option

00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,860
it's something in the past that we've

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,470
resisted because of the extra complexity

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,720
involved it's easier for us to generate

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,300
a single CD that does everything it's

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,010
also much easier for the users to happen

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,930
in single disc and it works I mean

00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,010
that's why we started doing DVDs and now

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,360
blu-rays as well

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:18,550
I mean thankfully at the moment today

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,700
the blue way you can have you can fit

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:24,760
all of amd64 or three at six on a single

00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,810
julik dual layer blu-ray next week I

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,820
don't know if they're still going to be

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,860
the case we have too much software in

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,870
Debian but we know that

00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,310
or maybe we don't have enough that it's

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:37,460
getting very very difficult to actually

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,310
to get it to people the question about

00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:44,540
download statistics made me think of an

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,800
idea it's in the Debian CD context so

00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,250
I'm mentioning it here but it has

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:52,430
broader applicability could Debian

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,650
actually consider commissioning some

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,660
market research I know we don't want to

00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,670
do things like phoning home by default

00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,480
and similar things out of respect for

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:04,400
our users but it's not disrespectful to

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,110
use statistically valid professional or

00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,970
professionals doing such as we build

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:13,010
techniques to actually gather data for

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:17,050
us in a natural way we're late onto that

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:19,610
we've had discussions about pop comp

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:23,270
every release for the last four that I

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:25,070
remember there's also if we could put

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,620
something into pop calm to say how a

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:30,800
system was installed we could possibly

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:34,970
track that we know it's it's all useful

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:38,000
information it doesn't it doesn't talk

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,010
about user like like flexibility like

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,320
you may have to need to ask my questions

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:45,260
and words to find out things like yeah

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,210
would another option work for you you

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:52,580
know how important is blah so forth

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:53,780
absolutely so wait we've got lots of CDs

00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,560
I'm gonna move on from that unless

00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,570
there's anything else

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,150
Daniel last question I think yeah this

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:01,690
this whole thing of collecting user data

00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,730
and popcorn yeah I mean it's it's a

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,830
two-edged sword I mean it can have

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,500
tremendous benefits and it can be a

00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:12,260
painful thing for people I mean one idea

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:16,160
I had this morning at breakfast was that

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:18,470
we could gather data from people about

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,290
their old bug reports so when they've

00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,000
got a new version of a package and

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,330
they've filed a bug report against an

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,840
old version then they could be prompted

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:31,370
to to close the bug report or to provide

00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,800
more feedback there's a lot of

00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,260
intelligent things that we could do to

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,550
reduce manual effort in things like the

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,800
release process or whatever else okay

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,930
sure they're all wondering slightly off

00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,460
topic so if we leave it there yeah it's

00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,740
it's off topic but the whole idea of

00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:50,500
collecting data more data than we're

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,850
collecting now where its downloads CD

00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:58,150
usage other media bugs the whole gamut

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,560
of course while not going to fall into

00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,480
the Big Brother state where people are

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,490
scared and start complaining you know I

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,380
wouldn't be too happy if too much if my

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,180
system usage was was shared with the

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:14,170
rest of the world it's a difficult call

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:15,880
I just wanted to qualify a little bit

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,320
the comment I made earlier about you

00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,730
know the problem with net inst is that

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,920
it installs too much it's actually a

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,370
Debian installer frustration not a

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:27,490
debian CD frustration okay but you know

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:30,280
we we did the biz card size images in an

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,410
era when there was a physical unit of

00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,860
media called a business card see deal

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,810
that was briefly in vogue and popular

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,520
and all of that but the thing that I've

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,710
always wanted that always caused me to

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,520
get a net inst instead of business card

00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:47,560
was I wanted a unit of stuff which would

00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,300
allow me to take a cold dead machine and

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,330
as quickly as possible get it to the

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:55,090
point where it's booted it's on the net

00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:57,160
it can run an SSH D and I can install

00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,230
exactly what I want on it yeah and so

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,540
things like automatically pulling

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,820
security updates for the versions of the

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,730
packages that were on that unit of media

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,530
are absolutely the wrong thing to do

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,510
because I may not even want to run the

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,670
version of Debian that that unit of

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,589
install media was built you just want

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,690
the system up immediately that you can

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,089
do useful things with exactly and and

00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:21,040
where useful things is defined as I know

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,570
exactly what I want to install on it I

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,730
want to control that whether it's

00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:27,280
bringing all of genome 3 and all of its

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,930
dependencies or whether it's I got five

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,190
packages I want to install and don't

00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,930
touch anything else is sort of

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,030
immaterial sure so one of the things I'd

00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,790
love to see come out of this sort of

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,220
re-evaluation of what are the right

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:41,770
media unit sizes and so forth to have is

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,590
that at least one of them sort of meets

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:47,320
that criteria of a standalone object

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:50,950
that doesn't need networking to complete

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,020
its processing at all but the result of

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,270
using that unit of media is something

00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:58,060
that can boot and beyond a net run an

00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:05,200
sshd and be able to install other

00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:07,030
software okay that actually does come

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,950
back to another question that I asked

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,320
every time we ever do this talk

00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:18,130
does anyone here use business card

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:20,830
images or anyone on IRC if you can talk

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,610
so Oh wonderful

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,960
yeah again the reason I always ask is

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,000
occasionally people say yes yes yes it's

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,890
really important for me and yet the

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,830
business code CDs are also falling away

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,960
the least stable of our will of our

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,730
least images because they depend on

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,590
versions matching with what exactly

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,480
what's on the archive yes it's consider

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,040
the problem I've always had every time

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,940
I've tried to use one it hasn't actually

00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,470
worked yeah exactly so I mean if given

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,180
that I would be tempted to just to

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:53,620
remove that frustration altogether and

00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:55,720
just not bother supporting them okay

00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,310
fine if we can minute that then I've got

00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:02,670
I've now got people backing me up for

00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,670
this for the first time so cool okay

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,330
[Music]

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,730
actually going back to walk back

00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:13,390
slightly reorganizing things the other

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:17,980
issue we have is we have again far too

00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:22,390
many CDs the the build that happened

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:27,480
this morning I believe for amd64 for

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,480
Weezy we are looking at a set of 73 CDs

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:33,400
clearly no one is ever going to download

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,610
all of those if anybody ever does I want

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,840
to make I want to go and find them and

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,690
first of all slap them and say what are

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,540
you doing and get personally hand them a

00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,130
DVD drive because at least then you get

00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,690
you get a you know a number of discs so

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,630
that you can count on your on your

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:52,480
fingers and toes I mean we have too many

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:56,110
DVDs we're looking at I think 11 maybe

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,790
at this point for Weezy as well this is

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,480
something that's come up a few times in

00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:03,580
the past we decided already that for the

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,669
primary for the main architectures which

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,379
are I three eight six and AMD 64 and

00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:10,629
source I tweet sources an architectural

00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:13,539
Debian CD it's easier that way that we

00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:16,330
do provide every ISO for every

00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:18,789
possibility so we have all of those 73

00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:23,769
ISO images available for download for

00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:26,950
HTTP BitTorrent we have all of the DVDs

00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:30,039
available we have we don't do full ISO

00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,139
downloads for blue ways because frankly

00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:34,450
the number of people who are downloading

00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:36,279
them is so small I don't care if we make

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,309
their lives a little bit harder we do

00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:42,519
not need another 25 gigabyte image just

00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:44,769
because what is the remaining value in

00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,259
actually producing the isel's well we

00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:48,999
can just say to users if you really want

00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:51,749
them chick doe is there for you

00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:54,580
exactly so what we've done for the other

00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:57,940
architectures is we've already switched

00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:01,179
over to just having say we we will ship

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:04,299
the first three CD ISO images the first

00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:07,269
one DVD ISO image and everything else is

00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:09,549
jig do if people really really want the

00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:10,989
other images again they can have they

00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:12,460
can have the slightly more hassle

00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:15,220
instead of just a direct click to

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,289
download for a nicer image if I ever get

00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,759
back to it I might finish jig dufus

00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:23,799
which was a fuse

00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:25,059
based jig due to izo tool if we could

00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,489
run that on all the mirrors that would

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:29,289
be really really cute although they'd

00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:31,960
probably then complain about cpu user

00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:35,619
job and disk usage it's you know it's

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,019
not though there isn't an easy win so

00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:40,989
what I'm considering for wheezy is

00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:43,029
switching over to a reduced set of

00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:45,700
either images I'm assuming no one here

00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:50,139
is going to complain about that Oh Don

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:53,409
maybe I mean I would just appreciate if

00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:57,669
we continue distributing at least source

00:21:53,409 --> 00:22:03,850
on DVD but I don't definitely don't want

00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:06,309
CD images so if the decision yeah if we

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,619
the decision was just to have real DVD

00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:11,350
iso so that if for some reason you

00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:14,559
couldn't get you do to work okay that's

00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:16,299
cool easily ISOs beyond CDs for source

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,879
actually yes true and not all that

00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:21,450
useful yeah okay so yeah good point

00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,450
thank

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,110
so fine I will change the sets available

00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:31,860
to match this if we drop the business

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:34,620
cards will reduce we will produce fewer

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,060
of the ISOs just because it if nothing

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:40,830
else it makes releasing faster as well

00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:42,360
and we all like that yeah I mean exactly

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,930
we're now at the stage where we are

00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:50,460
io bound producing about half a terabyte

00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:52,440
worth of images on release day now that

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,600
we know we got a really really gorgeous

00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,460
big fast build machine Thomas crane

00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,800
sponsored it I will you know name drop

00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,650
them because it's really appreciated we

00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,380
went from spending basically 24 hours on

00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:07,650
release day just building CDs down to

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,840
about 6 or 7 that was a huge difference

00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,310
obviously as time goes on we keep on

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,440
producing more and more software in

00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,900
Debian so it's going to creep up but

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,980
actually having a nice big machine to do

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:24,150
that on helps ok a more general question

00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:27,420
you've mentioned in the past using exact

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:30,210
compression instead of yes is this

00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:32,310
something that could help us absolutely

00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:36,150
good point I forgot to mention it in

00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:39,840
here X ed is substantially better than

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:41,280
gzip for almost everything we have we've

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,170
been talking about it already

00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:50,640
Ansgar has been looking at specific

00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:54,780
numbers for it using acceptance instead

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:57,930
of gzip saves about 20% of the wholock

00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,910
aria we're not proposing a total archive

00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,050
rebuild to switch to exit because I

00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,980
think again the release team will

00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:09,810
probably murder us it's a release goal

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:15,360
cool ok good go do it yes we should

00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:18,870
switch the default I believe the issue

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,670
with doing it silent looked at excerpt

00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,070
before the reason we didn't switch the

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:27,810
default instantly to be zipped to was

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:28,530
that it was so CPU and memory expensive

00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,750
on SMO

00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:32,880
machines to do the unpack is except got

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:36,140
the same issues ER is better it's better

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,610
than bees it - I believe compressing is

00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,770
horrendously painfully slow the

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:45,060
decompress is much better so compression

00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:49,080
is horribly slow so I recompressed the

00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:53,010
entire archive of 4 mg 64 on some 48

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,710
core machine and some packages like the

00:24:53,010 --> 00:25:00,000
Linux kernel debug symbols took half an

00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:02,910
hour on the other hand decompressing

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,980
them was faster than gzip on my laptop

00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:10,830
and the memory do usage is also

00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:13,290
reasonable I think it uses only a few

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:17,670
megabytes was the setting that with the

00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:19,170
setting said DP kg uses the flip side of

00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,060
switching to X ed is that there is still

00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:25,410
software out there that doesn't yet

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:27,990
support X ed we've been we've had a

00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:30,690
constant debate for the last few months

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:33,210
about it specifically to bootstrap which

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,790
of course we use in di we can trivially

00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,770
change it in di to support exit as well

00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:40,110
I believe that's already happened the

00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:43,560
problem is people don't necessarily want

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:47,130
to require exit if when people are using

00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:49,860
to bootstrap on non Debian systems I'm

00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,150
not so convinced by that argument I'm

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,660
thinking we should just tell the world

00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:57,210
look we've moved on cat you know keep up

00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:59,430
if there are any other arguments for it

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,200
which make it make that not possible I'd

00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,770
like to hear them but I haven't heard

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,940
them yet

00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:15,330
Neil so I mean one of the arguments

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:17,520
about X set / lzma / what version yeah

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:20,370
is often on on other systems I mean

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,920
there's fairly modern itch like think

00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:25,680
open SUSE 812 and various things

00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:29,640
recently which have issues with exactly

00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:33,060
which version of Excel u tilde are being

00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,340
included so and including the last

00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,990
release of Debian has that issue as well

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,910
so depending on where you want to do

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,320
your WTO that might be an issue there so

00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,149
we pick a version that we expect people

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,080
to have it

00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:49,339
sensibly yeah I think that makes sense

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:52,700
so anyway if I I'm not going to mention

00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:53,809
the SB face please pretend that that

00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,509
never happened

00:26:53,809 --> 00:27:00,950
EF is something that we do have to do in

00:26:56,509 --> 00:27:03,619
Debian seedy and really really before we

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:06,049
ship we Z it's not going to be too long

00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:08,029
before it will be difficult to buy

00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:11,409
machines that do not have BIOS and

00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:14,210
they're gonna be EFI only I expect Steve

00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:16,820
yeah so an additional issue there which

00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,859
actually following the previous SP

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,969
discussion we had a hallway talked about

00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:27,830
was the fact that in fact Debian today

00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:31,729
on x86 max boots well because it has no

00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:33,309
EFI boot support we in in Ubuntu we've

00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:36,349
run into a large number of issues with

00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:38,659
supporting everything on one CD Fedora

00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:40,909
has done it Matthew Garrett's magic

00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:43,580
hybrid stuff so if you expect to be able

00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:45,830
to have a single CD that boots on efi

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,859
machines of all flavors as well as bio

00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:52,489
systems there's definitely some work to

00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:56,929
do to track down what MJG has done and

00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:59,989
integrate that yeah absolutely we do

00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:01,969
need to get efi working i presume that's

00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:05,330
not controversial help would be

00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:07,489
appreciated in terms of testing efi I

00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:10,450
currently don't own any machines that

00:28:07,489 --> 00:28:14,929
use it so obviously we can play with the

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:17,690
efi in qmu but of course the way the

00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:19,399
world is with bios ISM and EFI is not

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,869
going to be any different every

00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:23,239
motherboard is going to be different in

00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:25,009
terms of its quirks and whatever so I am

00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:27,859
going to be starting to push out testing

00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:30,049
images specifically targeting efi and i

00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:32,059
will be mailing peak mailing the lists

00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:34,549
about it asking for help the more

00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:36,529
testing we can get done on the more

00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:38,719
different brands of machine the better I

00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:40,219
don't want to be waking up the morning

00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:42,469
after the release to people complaining

00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:44,109
oh my god Debian's crap it doesn't boot

00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:47,259
on my machine

00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:47,259
Steve again

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,520
I'm inclined to think we probably

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,900
shouldn't rely entirely on crowdsourcing

00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,330
the testing should we put in a

00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,980
requisition with the DPL to get you some

00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,920
or somebody who's going to do the

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,990
testing on this some EFI hardware um

00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,160
rather than just relying on it it's

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,740
somebody that can be able to do it

00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,510
because they're oh to be honest I'm

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,090
gonna end up buying a machine regardless

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,860
don't worry about that but well that's

00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,350
one machine and everybody's different

00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,550
how about you Nisha that's a very good

00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:20,330
question it's something I haven't done

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:22,550
research into to be honest one

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,650
motherboard from each of the you know

00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:27,530
one motherboard from each of the color

00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:29,090
of the common motherboard vendors two or

00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:31,880
three different brands a laptop would

00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:33,470
probably be useful you know and

00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,000
obviously once we know that it works

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,290
they don't have to stay out that they

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,880
don't have to stay around that we can go

00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:46,010
and use them for other things so yeah if

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:49,429
I help we'll talk about it more Multi

00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:52,580
arch is confusing in Debian CD world in

00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:54,770
that we already have what we've been

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,410
calling multi Arch in Debian CD and we

00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:00,490
had it years ago well way before these

00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:04,429
these people trying to do in the archive

00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:07,540
in multi arch terms in Debian CD that

00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:10,190
just means that we have we will boot on

00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,410
several architectures and we will start

00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,260
the Installer for each of those

00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:18,679
architectures natively so the obvious

00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:21,020
ones are easy mb 64 and i386 we used to

00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,640
have those multi arch with PPC until we

00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,700
just ran out of space on the disks and

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,220
nobody cared about PPC anymore we used

00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,440
to have the special that fall on came up

00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,890
with which was the HP one so we had a

00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:37,250
single CD that would boot on alpha and

00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:39,410
hppa and IA 64 that we've required quite

00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,840
a lot of just hackery in the boot sector

00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:43,730
but hey it worked it was a lovely

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,559
technology demo and I'd love to think

00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,559
that maybe half a dozen people used it

00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,929
that's what we mean by multi arch into

00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:55,190
in Debian CD at the moment so that one

00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:57,860
of the more common one of the most

00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:59,390
useful images that we've made people

00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,440
have told me several times and I have to

00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:04,220
believe them

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:07,730
is we have a multi arch amd64 and i386

00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,840
and source DVD which is the perfect DVD

00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:11,510
if you want to do giveaways at

00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,460
conferences all of your GPL requirements

00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,960
are met on a single disc and you know

00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,000
it's a good message to give to people

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,710
here's all the binaries it'll install on

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,210
your machine and you have all of the

00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,070
information you need to go with it if

00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,520
you ever want to rebuild anything that's

00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:26,330
cool

00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:31,190
we like that as multi arch however we

00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:33,230
got the beginnings of it in wheezy it's

00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,950
confusing to use the same name fine

00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,540
whatever

00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,540
we had it first you don't go and change

00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:43,250
[Music]

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,870
beyond wheezy we're going to one of the

00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:50,090
things that we've been talking about is

00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:52,370
having partial architectures or having a

00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:54,860
CD that doesn't just that doesn't

00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:56,270
necessarily contain all of our 386 and

00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,310
all of amd64

00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:01,940
but for example you would have your DVD

00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:05,240
that contains a basic AMD 64 system and

00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:08,110
then would have the our 386 equivalents

00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:11,690
that used to be in ia32 libs

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:13,460
specifically that lots going to get hard

00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,650
it's going to get really really

00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:19,070
difficult to test we are going to need

00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,840
support in di for it if anyone wants to

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,940
volunteer to work on that please do

00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,820
because as we found out the last talk

00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:28,310
and we all know surely the DI team is

00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,990
struggling for manpower with all lots

00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:32,360
and lots of cute things like this where

00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:38,540
people can make a big difference for di

00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:43,730
please dive in who else do we get to and

00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:45,470
yes but they'll just stir jumping back

00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:51,590
slightly one of the comments from IRC

00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:53,870
about Yui fee is that there's some

00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:56,660
project potentially around you if you

00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:59,390
test beds which you can run and emulate

00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:03,250
stuff that that should do it will help

00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:07,030
we need to check a real hardware - yeah

00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:09,470
the last thing I wanted to mention

00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,090
finally finally finally it's been a long

00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,970
time coming

00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:16,370
I've got some work going right now to

00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:19,190
start doing regular Debian live builds

00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:22,360
on the ds8 hardware which is pettersen

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:25,190
which is the normal CD build machine

00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,770
daniel has done an awesome job in the

00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,280
last few years of developing the Debian

00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,780
life were the Debian life project

00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,720
doesn't necessarily have the time when

00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:38,000
we do releases to be able to get regular

00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:42,860
releases of Debian live out at the same

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,200
time as we do the install CDs so it's

00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:47,240
been far too long and I apologize it's

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,610
just lack of time on my part we are

00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,240
going to get regular Debian live builds

00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:55,670
alongside the install CDs starting real

00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,200
soon now with the weeklies and then when

00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,840
we get the weazy

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:04,340
main release we'll start doing it for

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:07,580
the Weezy point releases - so DSA have

00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:10,880
helped helped some with that Jimmy is is

00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:13,700
volunteering help as well again testing

00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:18,320
for those I'll be pushing out more

00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:21,320
information soon do we have anything

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,250
else people want to talk about or have I

00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,810
scheduled off I had a question do we are

00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,420
we still some happened are you seeing a

00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:33,410
CD that has all Debian on it or the

00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:35,270
blu-ray to layer we have the blue way

00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:38,870
the double like Jill layer blue way

00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:40,430
still for now you can get a single disc

00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,370
that holds all of amd64

00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:45,470
or all of our three eight six yes I

00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:47,870
don't know I said we are really down to

00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,580
like the last hundred mega so left of

00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:51,470
that disc if the if the release team let

00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,930
any more stuff into easy it won't fit

00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:56,420
anymore but and do we produce the same

00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:59,210
for source or is it we also do the same

00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,950
for source as well yes so actually yes

00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,720
that is a nice one to be able to give

00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,130
out and approximately no one is ever

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,360
going to burn it because the blank media

00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:08,090
costs a fortune

00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,580
but hey yeah it's an option yes but just

00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:13,580
being able to hand Debian source to

00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:15,740
anyone yeah I said if we're not careful

00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:21,590
I will lead a dual layer blue wake under

00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:23,990
CD so with the multi urge thing and

00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:26,869
talking about doing the ia32 lives

00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:29,600
and on there yeah do we know if the the

00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:32,060
multi existing multi art CD that's amd64

00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,850
+36 already includes the right set of

00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:37,250
packages I have no idea okay cuz I think

00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:39,200
maybe it it would be better to try to

00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,420
make sure that that meets our needs

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,730
rather than doing a whole nother sort of

00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,670
image possibly yeah I mean what we do at

00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:48,770
the moment for the multi arch DVD is we

00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:52,240
treat it like a normal DVD we try to get

00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:54,890
all of the desktops on we try to get all

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,210
of the desktops for both architectures

00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,220
it's actually works quite well because

00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:02,180
there's a lot of overlap in the binary

00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,920
all packages I don't know exactly how

00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,230
far down it goes I must admit I haven't

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,080
checked the multi arch DVD to make sure

00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:11,270
that we have all of know and all okay to

00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:21,260
hear on there yet and I'm and we're back

00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:23,180
to where we started anything else well I

00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:26,180
guess not well thank you everybody for

00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:30,560
turning up hopefully that was useful for

00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:32,000
you as it was for me please expect I'm

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,760
going to be boring you lots more with

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,560
emails to Debian developer to Debian CD

00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,840
and Debian boot in the next few months

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,550
as we get closer to we'd wheezy there

00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,170
will be a lot more for you lot to do as

00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,720
well as me especially when we start

00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:50,780
trying to test EFI thank you very much

00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,780
