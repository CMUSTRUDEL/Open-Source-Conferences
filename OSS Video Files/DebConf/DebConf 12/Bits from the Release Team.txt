I will replace the comments from the IRC

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,599
if you have any comments you can shout

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:13,500
and you can screen and he can repeat the

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,450
stream or if you can wait for the mic he

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,539
can rants so if you're gonna say

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:23,760
something more than a scream please wait

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:25,710
for for the mic so there we are thank

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,740
you very much it's good to see so many

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,019
people here normally I complain about

00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,510
the first every single one for the last

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,100
three or four Deb consus has always been

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,800
after the cheese and wine party in the

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,930
morning so we have about five people sat

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,730
around looking very hungover and then

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,620
I'm one of those people who has to get

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,320
up on stage and give a talk about about

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,879
the release process now this time it was

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,010
slightly different it was not after the

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,750
cheese and wine party but also on the

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,090
first day of Deb comp so writing these

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,320
slides happened a few hours ago so have

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,320
to bear with me if there's any any

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,899
spelling mistakes um my name's Neil

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,899
McGovern I've been involved with Debian

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,659
for us twelve or so years in one form or

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,659
another everywhere from policy writing

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,380
from the Web Apps policy to the security

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,200
team and lately in my incarnation as one

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,180
of the to release managers we also have

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,270
here Adam Barrett who's at the front and

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,430
is going to give a little wave and Phil

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,280
Kern who's in the green t-shirt halfway

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,200
through so if you have any any questions

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,549
as well then they'll feel free to ask us

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,579
these two people as well now a quick

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:40,619
overview of why I'm up here and Adams

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:44,040
not apart from he he sort of twisted my

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,540
arm behind my back until I did it is we

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,670
sort of decided that we were going to

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,799
split the release management into to a

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,750
technical side so dealing with

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,729
transitions and bugs and making sure

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,040
that happens and then a management

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,130
t-type side of communicating with the

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:04,680
project and talking to people so that

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:06,600
that is for my sins my my job so so a

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,489
quick outline of what would go what well

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,349
we're here to talk about we've had a

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,700
brief team change we've had another

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,860
person come into the team which is

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,530
fantastic

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,990
a quick talk about the new things that

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,720
are happening Weezy a little bit about

00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,420
the freeze and and how it went and and

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,460
the sort of issues we saw around

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,840
time-based freezes which is a thing for

00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,640
people who don't know or they a new

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,360
thing we're trying this year on how we

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,850
manage freeze policies and and then how

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,950
you can get your package unblocked what

00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,650
our current thing that means we're

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,360
frozen actually means and then a little

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,290
bit of information about when we expect

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,740
to release and and that sort of area and

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:52,550
then some details on how to contact us

00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:54,590
and so firstly ircnet Kibby cyril has

00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,470
joined us as release assistant and is

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,330
doing a fantastic job I'm sure if you've

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,860
mailed the list with um block requests

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,140
or all the transitions then you then

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,120
you've come across him already but of

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,770
course we always need more people more

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,800
people to come and volunteer and helping

00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:12,800
the race team it's traditionally been a

00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,130
fairly small team anywhere between two

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,200
to about six ish or so so more people

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,239
helping in this what can be a very

00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,810
manual quite intensive task it is

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,489
certainly very very useful and certainly

00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,760
see any of us at the end if you're

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:31,400
interested in helping out with that so

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,010
Weezy we have now frozen which means

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,500
we're not having automatic migration of

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,720
packages going into testing which is

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,160
starting to give us an idea of the sort

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,530
of new things we're going to see in

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:48,140
Weezy so we've got KD 4.8 Nome 3.4 new

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,510
versions of Python and a 3.22 Linux

00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,640
kernel so this is quite up-to-date stuff

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,610
that we're pushing out and hopefully

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,910
we'll be in in the in the next release

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,500
which I hope will be fairly soon but one

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,780
of the main points here is that we don't

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,850
actually know what's going to be there

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,290
because there's I think at the last

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,420
count 39,000 binary packages or so in a

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,880
Debian release so we don't know what we

00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,760
can tell everyone and tell the world

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,709
about what's in our latest release as

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,180
you know I think today and we're going

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,880
to be having the new desktop base

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,669
artwork go in which will be quite nice

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,630
so we'll have a new look for that and

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,150
with my

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,760
press team hat on I've already had

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,050
requests from journalists saying what's

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,330
going to be in the new release can you

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,030
give us screenshots can you show us the

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,620
really cool things and so we got once

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,290
again going to be using this wiki page

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,260
at the bottom which is wiki Debian dot

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,840
org slash new in Weezy and I'd encourage

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,610
everyone if to go and put in really

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,290
interesting stuff there things that

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,180
going to be new and Weezy and really

00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,040
quite exciting for the users to to

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,570
really help show what's going to be in

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,090
the new release and and make everyone

00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,480
I'm really excited about it then that

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,670
would be great

00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,890
that's also the place that the press

00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,200
team are going to be basing release

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,030
announcements off so what we've got

00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,980
coming up so that's the really the place

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:19,160
to to put it all so I mentioned the

00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:22,700
freeze we last time at Deb Kampf we had

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,020
a few it we've had a few different

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,240
interesting announcements around

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,430
freezing and when we do it this is

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,690
starting Deb Kampf nine when we said

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,780
we're going to follow a bump to and

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,630
everyone said ah no don't do that and

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,850
then we had a issue in Deb Kampf ten

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,830
where we said with wrote and despite

00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,310
males to DDA saying we're refreezing

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,650
really soon now we said we're frozen

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,030
during the release team talk and that

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,170
didn't go down very well obviously

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:53,420
either so we decided to use a time-based

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,710
freeze so we say in advance when we're

00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,060
going to freeze and and there's a few

00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,230
advantages and disadvantages to that and

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,680
it's something we decide to do new we

00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:07,640
announced this about where we announced

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,100
it in June last year so so we've known

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,580
for a while that the freeze is happening

00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,860
and we decided this date in a sprint

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,990
there's been some discussion about why

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,180
did we pick June and why not different

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,060
dates and to be honest there is no good

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,830
answer if you pick up any single month

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,750
or any single date it will always be

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,370
inconvenient for someone we pick the

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,170
best one we can and and when we think

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,030
would be sort of good in the in the sort

00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,030
of cycle to try try and get things

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:37,669
together and this is really to help give

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,100
maintain as a date and a framework that

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:43,430
they know they can can release with

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,930
so they should know far in advance of

00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,910
when we're going to freeze and so should

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:52,030
have everything ready done in plenty of

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,840
time to make sure that that happens

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,110
how's it going so far

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,300
well most of the large transitions which

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,360
we asked for were done they were still

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,760
some which weren't partially due to time

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,320
pressures making sure that we have

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,420
essentially enough people in the release

00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,840
team to handle each of these transitions

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:14,840
a transition happens when somebody

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,150
uploads a new set of packages with a API

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,410
break or an ABI break and essentially

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,020
you have to rebuild everything that

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,300
depends on it and one of the issues is

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,520
that all of those packages have to go

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,130
into testing together to make sure it's

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,830
all remains compatible and that often

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,660
requires a bit of hand-holding and just

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,700
making sure that you sort of make sure

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,890
it's in the right place to - all going

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,840
together and and and you have to handle

00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,520
Bert and that just requires manpower of

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,830
someone to look after it and make sure

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,550
it works and so we have had to

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:49,010
unfortunately postpone some transitions

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:52,010
there's been a there's a few I think

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,170
blip PNG was the the biggest one that

00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,630
that we just weren't able to get in in

00:07:54,170 --> 00:08:00,350
time due to obviously this the size of

00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:03,200
that but obviously we try to do as much

00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,360
as we can and we stand one of the main

00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,400
issues we saw is we still had a lot of

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,770
last-minute uploads and things done

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:14,510
really at the last minute as in major

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:17,060
changes a few days before we freeze or

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,620
or various other issues around that

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,020
because people said well we haven't had

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,960
time to do it because they've forgot

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,660
about it or something another issue

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,630
there is we've had a couple of very

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:34,760
large transition changes very shortly

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:38,180
before the release and that caused quite

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,490
a few issues as you can not very well

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,440
see on the graph the green line

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,140
essentially is the number of RC bugs

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,510
which the release team are interested in

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,730
which happen each release we were going

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,830
down at a rate of knots and that was

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,960
excellent and all wonderful and then

00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,620
there was a couple of

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,850
breakages that that happened and that

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,950
sent us right back up and it's now got

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:04,360
back to about the same level there so

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,280
I'm not in we're not entirely sure and

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,750
we're not gonna think about until after

00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,210
we've done with the release on on how we

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,670
manage that sort of transition based

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:16,450
policy because things can break quite

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:21,520
horribly just before release I'm

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:23,050
actually privately hopeful that we that

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,030
is it hopefully we will just get better

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,210
each time as maintained is get used to

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:31,660
when we say okay we're freezing in say

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:34,840
June 2014 then we will freeze in June

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:37,720
2014 and hopefully that will start to

00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,760
become a lot more accepted and people

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,810
will start to realize that when we say

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,510
we're going to freeze them we actually

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,880
are so doing major changes the the month

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,260
before are just something that you

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,320
really should try and avoid it because

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,320
it's going to delay everyone and one of

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:57,250
the aims of the time-based freezes was

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,560
to try and ensure we have a short

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,410
release and that that's really down to

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,690
the number of release critical bugs so

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:09,250
at the moment we have a load of stats

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:11,800
these Holly Mars stats which he produces

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,510
every week which is fantastic the main

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,890
number at the bottom of there is the 603

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:20,770
that is I think higher than we've ever

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,660
frozen with before and not somewhere

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,090
where we would normally freeze which is

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,160
one of the reasons that has come so late

00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,950
in what we said originally it will be in

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,290
June 2012 we froze on the 30th of June

00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,600
2012 in the hope to just try and bring

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,210
that bug count down as much as possible

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,270
because that is still very very high for

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:42,340
a freeze and we essentially just need to

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,920
try and get that down to to actually be

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:48,550
able to release there's a lot of talk

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,800
about how perhaps being of freezing

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,780
harms on stable or various other bits

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,250
and pieces and and the answer to that is

00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,930
is simply the sooner we get the freeze

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,370
up and the sooner ever so if the sooner

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,810
we get the release out the sooner the

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:04,980
archive can be unfrozen and as part of

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,980
that we've got the

00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:10,429
our freeze policy which is when we're

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,040
gonna unblock Paul Bern packages to to

00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:14,809
get into the release we're going to try

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,470
again a gradual freeze because we

00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:19,579
thought this went very well last time so

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,679
the sort of things we're having at the

00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:25,369
moment they accepted things into the

00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:28,639
release will be our C bugfixes fixes for

00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:31,699
release goals which we've set up a while

00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,369
ago there is going to be a potentially

00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,749
new sort of release goal which is going

00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:40,189
to be rebuilding a number of packages

00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:42,350
with exciting compression to try and get

00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:44,029
things to fit on the first CD anymore at

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,470
the moment because otherwise we're going

00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:48,589
to have a problem essentially getting

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,749
Noman to one CD so there might be a few

00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:54,709
nm use around that but that's sort of a

00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:58,459
side issue and then trance important

00:11:54,709 --> 00:12:00,410
bugs for optional extra packages and

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,059
those need to go through and stable and

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,919
we do this to make sure that there's the

00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:07,519
maximum amount of testing available and

00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,559
that everyone really gets some exposure

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,019
to that and you get that bat handling

00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,970
going through and stable into testing in

00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:16,879
the way the Debian QA process really

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,619
works well and then finally translation

00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,899
and documentation updates these are

00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:23,989
normally very low impact I should point

00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:26,149
out that as the freeze goes on and the

00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:28,519
sort of bottom line will go up on this

00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:30,139
so we will start to get to the stage

00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,179
where we are eventually where we only

00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,730
have our C bug fixes only and that's

00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:36,139
highly targeted our C bug fixes that are

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:40,129
being loud in as we get closer and

00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:43,730
closer to that release date so when do

00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:45,619
we release these we'll have increasing

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,289
numbers of complexity depending on how

00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:51,110
much time you spend in hash Debian so

00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:54,139
it's real soon now certainly compared to

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,629
to to what we've done before sooner if

00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:58,519
you help which I'll get on to in a

00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:00,470
second and one which I made up which is

00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,139
when the release critical bug count

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,639
which is zero which is the actual point

00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:08,539
in which we release and that's the

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:11,720
important one to bear in mind so how can

00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:14,989
you help don't introduce new transitions

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,470
they break things horribly in many many

00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:16,889
ways

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,410
earlier I mentioned

00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:21,569
have to go through unstable if it's

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,609
involved in transition it can't

00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:26,519
this means the package is not going to

00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:30,359
get tested as well and as a consequence

00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:32,399
we have to do things like do a really

00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:34,679
thorough review on it and this just

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,739
takes up amount this takes up time and

00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,749
the amount of time it takes up simply

00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:42,179
means we can't process as many unblock

00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:44,220
requests and the freeze takes longer so

00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:47,369
doing these things which you say don't

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,779
do means that if you do the freeze is

00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:51,239
just going to take longer because we

00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:54,149
don't have enough people to to do all

00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:56,669
the reviewing that we want

00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:58,369
try not to upload things in too unstable

00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:01,290
that you don't want released and Weezie

00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:03,540
because for a similar reason this is

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,679
what we're going to be basing the next

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:10,709
release off and then try to migrate

00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:11,999
things through into testing may 28 bucks

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:13,470
please everyone keep doing that that's

00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:17,449
actually the key thing which everyone

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:20,249
should do find an RC bug there's there's

00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:22,379
603 at last count certainly out there

00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:24,179
there's plenty around to do that that's

00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:26,040
not a problem I think if they don't at

00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:27,509
DEFCON fix to RC books tomorrow then

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,869
then we can release that by the end of

00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:32,220
DEFCON 4 it should be great but it's

00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:33,600
it's trying to get these these sort

00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,309
things and really need to get those down

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,399
because that's the major issue that is

00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:40,169
going to hold us back testing is also

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,179
very important we're starting to get

00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:44,999
stage where we need to test migration

00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:46,649
and upgrade and install abilities and

00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:48,389
then things like that to try and get

00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:49,739
make sure that the user experience is

00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:52,079
grateful when they're trying to go from

00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:55,429
one release to the next and and tell us

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,779
about any problems that you do have and

00:14:55,429 --> 00:15:00,509
finally I'll mention this this link at

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,970
the bottom which is currently a dead

00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:05,639
bugs page with nothing tagged but over

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:08,730
the next few weeks or so that will start

00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:12,329
to fill up with a number of user tags

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:15,119
these are wheezy blocker tags which are

00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:18,569
bugs that will need to be fixed before

00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:20,489
we can release theirs ignore tags which

00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:22,589
we're going to essentially ignore for

00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:24,350
this release because they're minor or we

00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:27,119
or we don't think that they're actually

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,230
either release critical or or for this

00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,910
release or it's something that we're

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,670
just not going to block over

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,230
and there's will remove tags now these

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,480
are full packages that we're just going

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,980
to remove from the release which means

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,910
that if people don't fix those packages

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,980
they're not going to be in the release

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:47,480
similar to last year we've and this year

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,480
what we're trying to be fairly

00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,930
straightforward with our removal so

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,030
we're not going to delay removing

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,920
packages for months and months like has

00:15:54,030 --> 00:16:00,260
been happened a number of years in the

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,490
past and things will get removed because

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,870
especially if they've had release

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,850
critical bugs that have just been

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,650
ignored for a long for a long amount of

00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,720
time then leave packages if they're not

00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,330
very popular even if they're important

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,160
for one particular user developer then

00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,870
those really need to get those RC bugs

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,060
fixed and hopefully will be then we'll

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,190
be using those tags to to try and

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:24,090
increase the sort of visibility of what

00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:26,730
we're doing there so quick methods of

00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,980
contacting us on how to get your package

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:33,300
released there's a mailing list which is

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,830
Debian release lists Diderot IRC is hash

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,810
Debian release

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,430
and these great methods of contacting us

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:42,410
certainly really pop along and see us

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:45,690
and talk to us about anything you want

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,480
but the key thing is they may not get

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,430
your packages unblocked if you write a

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,810
debt mail to Debian release certainly at

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,960
the moment it's in court as you can

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,790
imagine it's incredibly busy because we

00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,420
have lots of people asking for unblocks

00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,700
and things like that

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,590
and there is a fairly high chance well

00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,470
certainly if it's me that I'll just miss

00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:06,630
your mail and then you'll essentially be

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,400
ignored for a while as as no one will

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,100
pick it up so the best thing to do is

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,380
use reportbug' against release book that

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,090
mean two org and that can handle things

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,370
like your binary and amuse your

00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:19,410
transitions your unblocks proposed

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,570
updates anything like that and that's in

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:25,260
a single place where we can track it and

00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:28,260
make sure things happen and they get it

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:33,330
get through otherwise they quite frankly

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:35,820
won't just and just finally a quick

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,770
thanks to kelabra who are my employees

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:41,840
and paid me to come here it's that's

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,840
that that's a big thank you for them

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:47,290
and that is as I explained probably the

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,610
the all the slicer that I had for the

00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,830
Reese because I normally like to leave a

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,660
fair amount for questions for the Reese

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,640
talk this time I haven't actually

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,020
announced that we're freezing now or

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,760
that we've released or anything so there

00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,170
might be a few fewer questions than I

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,170
normally get and a little bit less

00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,150
heckling but I thought I thought I'd

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,940
leave it there and see if anyone has any

00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,350
questions either on the release or stuff

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,370
we're looking to do in the future or

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,870
anything at all really

00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:14,370
so I'll certainly open up the floor to

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,370
do any questions that people have

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:27,480
so it was the name of wheezy plus one

00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:29,100
well so we returned it me and Adam work

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,870
we're having this debate about when we

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,960
when we should do this and and have a

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:38,490
talk we we haven't decided yet is the

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:41,730
basic answer weird think we're thinking

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,040
of announcement maybe in about a month's

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,220
time or so we normally do it last time

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,740
we did it about a month after the freeze

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,420
but there's been some ideas kicking

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,880
around there's been heavy lobbying from

00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,310
the Zerg and the shark lobbies have been

00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,040
coming to see us and say please call you

00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,170
the next release urgh who was the some

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,260
alien or something that is the big alien

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:07,110
guy and shark is just the key ring

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:09,180
maintainer z-- preferential choice I

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,920
have been threatened with having my key

00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,930
removed from the archive if we don't

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,940
pick sure but he did that last year last

00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,210
time as well so it's probably not gonna

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,800
happen

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:21,090
or maybe it hasn't I haven't noticed hey

00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,470
you don't know yeah apparently laughs

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,130
that's what I get for being management

00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:29,640
was was the comment there anyone else

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:33,510
yes what about the glove the claw that

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,950
was also another suggestion from Joe

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,110
somewhere

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:40,110
oh well that might make some quite good

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,570
artwork for t-shirts that I'm not sure

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,100
about that one either I've what what

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,600
normally happens when we will pick a

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,410
release name is we try and think up

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,960
something that hasn't been used

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,700
something that's quite iconic would

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,410
essentially look good on a t-shirt and

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,960
then we come up with this great name and

00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,670
we mention it to the rest of the release

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,870
team and have to be masters and they say

00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,020
that's horrible you're not using that

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,220
and then we go oh right okay fine so we

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,780
need to come up with something else and

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,000
and so then eventually we find something

00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:10,260
up people seem to like and and works

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,820
quite well anymore it's not a question

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,040
not actually really to the name of the

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,360
next release we have a history of

00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,420
burning out release team yes

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,740
given that Zack talked yesterday about

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,660
institutional memory and learning to do

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,540
things and given that we're trying

00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,310
time-based releases for the first time

00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,930
do you think that a substantial portion

00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,870
of the current release team will still

00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,250
be present in two

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:38,260
years time for the next time base freeze

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,480
do I do I think they'll still be a

00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,800
suspension portion present and do you

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,900
think we'll have enough of the current

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,210
team present in two years time that the

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,850
lessons we have learned from our first

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,559
time vs freeze will still be held within

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,480
the release team people will still know

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,800
what went wrong this time what worked

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,230
well and what we need to do better for

00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,610
next time not asking any of you to

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,040
commit to being here but do you have a

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,900
feel for I burned out the team fatals

00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,390
compared to previous years a previous

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,110
release team and how that's likely to

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,200
work in the future

00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:10,420
I think it's been helpful to have a

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:15,220
time-based freeze so that when these

00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:16,420
things do go wrong and when people when

00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,910
there is things that the big changes

00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,620
uploaded last minute and we can point at

00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,360
people and say look we've told you for

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,850
many a year and that this is happening

00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,570
now it does raise a level of frustration

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:30,460
that this is still happening in terms of

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,860
ensuring that the the memory continues

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,330
to the next time one of the things we

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,760
did after the last release is we had a

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,920
sprint with a retrospective and

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,450
documented it all and put it all online

00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,700
to make sure that there's something that

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,980
even new people can come and look at and

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,400
there's a lot of documentation going on

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:51,280
from Nils to make sure that that this

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,020
sort of stuff is documented so I'm

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,270
hopeful that even if that does happen I

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,420
don't have any particular reason what a

00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,370
reason why it should at the moment

00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,559
especially if we try and get more people

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,300
involved because part of the reason that

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,100
people have been burnt out in the

00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,080
release team is that there has just not

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,820
been enough people involved so it's it's

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,370
fallen all the work has fallen on the

00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,309
weight of a very few number of people

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:18,160
and and that's been the main issue there

00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:19,630
so I think if it does then hopefully

00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,120
we've got something in place to try and

00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,559
make sure that the ideas and what's gone

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:29,770
right and what's gone wrong will carry

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:32,380
on from a or C creates a candle as how

00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:39,490
does one see the tags on the packages

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:41,740
being discussing sorry well how does one

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,690
see the tags on the packages being

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,679
discussed yes so this is only for

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:50,289
release quick

00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:55,090
to call bugs if you go to the Deaf li /

00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:57,519
wheezy bugs then the whole list of bugs

00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,909
will eventually be on there and we'll go

00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:03,070
through and tag them all and they'll be

00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:05,409
they'll be documented in in there on to

00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,460
what's happening there's also a few

00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:09,850
other tools you can burn on your

00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,409
personal desktop ah see alert is one of

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,389
them which we'll tell you about release

00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:15,700
critical bugs and packages installed on

00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:17,169
your machine so hopefully if it's

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,940
installed on your machine you might care

00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:20,559
about that package so you should

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,119
probably have a look at those RC bugs

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,889
and if we go and fix them yep so the

00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,570
real answer to Jonathan's question there

00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,889
is in fact that the entire release team

00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,289
will still be around they'll just all be

00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:35,649
wearing wizard hats but I do have an

00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:37,299
actual question so one thing I've

00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:39,039
noticed in terms of how we deal with

00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:43,419
fixing up release critical bugs

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,240
I remember TBM 4 5 6 years ago had it

00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:50,230
was very good at organizing bugs washing

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,409
parties that had a distinct online

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,570
component to them and I kind of get the

00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:57,610
impression that we aren't doing that so

00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:59,320
well anymore where there are a lot of

00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:03,399
people organizing bugs washing parties

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,139
for Weezie in one locale or another but

00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:07,659
those seem to be taking place only in

00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:08,919
meatspace and there's no hash debian -

00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:10,389
bugs doesn't really get used for

00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,210
coordination and I'm wondering if you

00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:15,220
have any thoughts on if that's a problem

00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,710
that that's hurting our rate of fixing

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,190
our sea bugs and if so what we can do

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,490
about it

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,960
well one of the main lists suggestions

00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,820
that I'm sure you know is that we all

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,619
just go and create a Google hangout or

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,659
something like that and go sit on there

00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:31,419
and fix our sea bugs which I'm not sure

00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:32,769
that the right solution but I do think

00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:34,860
it is quite important to try and get

00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:39,399
more people involved in our see bugs

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:42,940
squashing and if we can try and get more

00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:45,070
people to come along to the even

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,269
virtually to a real-life bugs question

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,960
party then this would be a really really

00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:52,600
good thing probably one of the reasons

00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,730
that this hasn't happened again is the

00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,450
amount of effort it takes to organize an

00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,810
RC

00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,820
a RC bug squishing party certainly it's

00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,130
when you're actually thinking about oh I

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,750
need to make sure there's a venue place

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,070
of somewhere just people to stay and the

00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,110
rest of it then you don't necessarily

00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,880
think of oh and now I need to sort out

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:14,450
making sure that there's like an online

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,950
presence for people to come as well it'd

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,180
be really good to happen as to the

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,750
answer on how we make that happen

00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,800
without using proprietary or closed

00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,660
solutions or things that people aren't

00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,220
comfortable with I'm not sure at the

00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:30,050
moment Hey

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:33,280
for translation work but what's the

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:36,080
policy during the press how much time a

00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:44,270
quicker than the release team must have

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:46,040
the new translations about that long it

00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:51,230
may not be to scale but about that long

00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:55,880
and so there's a few there's a few times

00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:58,040
going on here one is how quickly is it

00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,800
I'm going to take us to respond to these

00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,310
bugs and things like that which is as

00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,110
soon as we can

00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,940
faster if more people come along and try

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,880
and help out things certainly doing some

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,620
basic triage from which anyone can do to

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,880
try and get an idea of what's going to

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,650
be in these particular bugs it's very

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,570
helpful for bringing down the amount of

00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,130
time and again these are all helpful for

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,480
actually getting the release out quicker

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,760
as well

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,190
so I suppose the sort of answer is which

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:29,210
is bitter to get our answer it's as

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:32,300
quick as we can so I've got this brand

00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,860
new package that's just about to go into

00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,890
new can I have a freeze exception please

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,570
well it depends which it depends which

00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,210
package it is if it's if it's your

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:44,290
special Debian CD package then possibly

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:50,750
or the new keyring archive but generally

00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:52,640
no we've we've had a few people who said

00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,830
we've got a new package can it just go

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,220
in I've just missed the freeze and to be

00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:00,470
honest we announced the freeze over a

00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,330
year ago we've been quite clear that

00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,040
this is when we're freezing and people

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,280
need to make sure stuff is ready in time

00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,290
and if it's not then I'm sorry then

00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,480
there's next time and hopefully part of

00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,350
this

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,090
we'll be able to make things more

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,679
predictable more reliable so people

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,770
won't be worried about when the next

00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:22,770
release is going to be and again it's

00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:25,860
it's our job as a release team to try

00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:27,150
and help the project release efficiently

00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,620
as a whole reason not just particular

00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:34,040
packages Neil I've been sitting here

00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,929
trying to process your allusion to

00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,240
Google+ Hangouts and so forth and I

00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:41,669
realize this is a completely radical

00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,100
idea and it's liable to upset all sorts

00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:48,059
of people in Debian but why don't use

00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:50,309
hash Debian - devel for something that's

00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:51,900
actually useful and have that be the

00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:57,480
place we all hang out when we're doing

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:59,040
bug squashing parties yeah I have no

00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,150
particular problems with you with using

00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,230
any channels and trying to get more

00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,230
people involved in squashing bugs

00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:09,270
releasing is a thing that the project

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,100
needs to do as a whole we're in the

00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,950
release team ahead help it and try and

00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,020
massage it along and try and happen but

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,610
if if developers as a whole don't want

00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,120
to release Debian or aren't interested

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:23,549
then it's just not going to happen

00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,679
there's not enough hours in the day or

00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:29,490
people in release team to get those six

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,200
hundred odd r/c bugs fixed or well

00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,929
without just removing half the archive

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,570
and that would probably not be the the

00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:39,059
most user friendly option and that we

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,100
have they're getting more people

00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:43,410
squishing these it means we release

00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,460
faster the freezes shorter and then we

00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,860
can move on to doing really exciting

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,480
things again it's essentially in

00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:58,010
everyone in everyone's hand to try and

00:28:48,480 --> 00:29:01,300
help this along no we think that's it

00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:03,700
are you sure

00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,380
I always get a little worried when we

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,940
got a really assistance I'll put their

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,820
their hands up saying yes I'll ask

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:12,490
something I don't actually want to ask

00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:16,600
something I just wanted to point another

00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:19,870
slot today at 4:00 p.m. yes well I will

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:22,600
put up a little description about the

00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:25,450
tools we use if you want to get involved

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,310
if you want to know what goes on behind

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:30,280
the scenes because this is more about

00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:33,640
the big picture not what we are actually

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:36,580
doing so if you're interested it should

00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,210
be rather buff like so if you want to

00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:41,860
ask questions there feel free if you

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,240
just that you know that it's happening

00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,450
today at 4:00 p.m.

00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,970
yeah yeah that's today at 4:00 a buff on

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,980
how we release things and the tools

00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,200
involved and how to get involved and do

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,900
things it'd be great to see certainly

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,060
this many people here and everyone here

00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,850
volunteering are going to come and help

00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,380
and be on the release team and to

00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:06,070
discuss all the RC bugs because that

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:08,320
would be brilliant think that's

00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,460
hopefully it then okay so that have you

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:17,819
thank you

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:17,819
