	00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,440
this session is meant to be a kind of

00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,650
discussion so hopefully some of you are

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:17,410
slightly awake so I don't just need to

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:19,640
say my own views this the sessions about

00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,230
Debian local groups or different

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,030
meetings that happen in different places

00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,100
but really the hope is that people can

00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,170
share their thoughts and experience I'm

00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,529
not someone who's currently running one

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,149
of these meetings or groups so it's not

00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:34,399
actually something I'm necessarily the

00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:36,199
most expert in and people who are really

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:44,210
participating in them probably have much

00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:46,910
more informed views so on the Debian

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:51,680
wiki there is a page called local groups

00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:53,899
and if you look at this page then this

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,010
is actually a that this map is not there

00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,960
at the moment but that's a map showing

00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,110
all the places that we claimed to have

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,610
local groups and if you believe that it

00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:06,320
looks very impressive that we have I

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,729
mean as expected it's more or less where

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,860
we have concentrations of Debian

00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:12,760
developers kind of where people come to

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,760
DEFCON from as well

00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:29,619
that's microphone just behind you in

00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:33,159
that local group did appear so

00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:35,320
so yeah the there are people in many

00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,330
places I mean in fact also in this

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,560
there's a lot more people if you in this

00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,869
this is people who have listed

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,670
themselves as a local group yeah people

00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,070
just list themselves for example on key

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,590
signing pages so if you're a an active

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,509
Debian developer traveling around or a

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,250
Debian contributor traveling around and

00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,990
you make an effort to contact people

00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,819
often and many put more places in the

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,280
world you can turn up a group to meet

00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:59,789
for a chat or key signing whatever

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,550
that's what I did I just found their

00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:05,590
email list on the wiki and contacted

00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:09,850
them and I met every one of them so it

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:12,640
works but so this looks quite impressive

00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,380
but in reality many of these groups are

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,060
dead or never really got started

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,640
someone just added on the wiki page

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,319
because it sounded a nice idea but the

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,570
group is just well there are some people

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,100
maybe who are physically based in that

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:31,420
location but they don't meet or really

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,430
do anything they just exist and even

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,260
when they do meet often in what happens

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,430
in practice is that the details are only

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,370
visible to people who are already

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,320
involved that for example it's somewhat

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,090
another person from outside is turning

00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,400
up and they emailed a few people or

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,620
those I mean in Edinburgh that we had

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,260
for a while some group of Debian people

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,060
meeting but all that happened was one

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,750
person was sending an email to the other

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,709
people he knew were likely to come so

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,060
probably actually there were lots more

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:00,190
people in the city who might have been

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,200
interested but because of the way it was

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,750
being organized it wasn't really visible

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:09,880
if he won't didn't already have a

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:13,859
connection into the group so to know

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:18,010
what people's interest or background or

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:19,959
experiences who here does have some kind

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,180
of thing that could be described as a

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,430
local group or local meeting or

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:28,260
something that they're currently

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,260
participating in or have done before

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:37,909
the Catalan kind of yeah and so who

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,810
definitely doesn't have any Debian

00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:43,440
connection around where they're living

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:47,010
or yeah and for those just out of

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,950
interest quickly for those people did

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,810
they did you have anyone you knew who is

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,650
involved in Debian before you started or

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:59,430
you just found Debian from the internet

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,599
and got a connection that way I mean or

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,280
do you think would it would it would

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,720
have helped you if there was some more

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:12,959
visible Debian people around or anyone

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:15,780
have an opinion I had some friends that

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,620
use Debian and that's how I start to use

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,949
it it's like for many years ago and now

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:27,060
I I'm looking for other people that I

00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:29,220
can do something together maybe yeah and

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,070
then from I don't know maybe also if

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,630
people are slightly awake then the ones

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,220
who have been involved in some group

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,810
maybe a couple of people at least would

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,700
like to say something about what their

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,500
group I mean what form does their group

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,030
tape because this again these things

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,460
vary some of them are very organized

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,130
have talks have regular meetings some is

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,139
just they know people know that a few

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,800
friends exist in the city or in the same

00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,690
country or whatever does anyone able to

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,450
describe what that what their experience

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,950
is yes I'm just a guest at my local

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:04,139
group I have to say because I'm

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:06,419
uploading yeah contributor and so this

00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,060
local group is stationed in a hack lab

00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:14,039
and I think also they meet over the

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:16,380
Hepler HEC lab email list so it's not

00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,720
really open to everybody who is in the

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,080
same city but they meet on a regular

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,520
basis I don't even know if they're on

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,520
the wiki but I will check

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,169
yeah so in Switzerland we've got a local

00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:41,060
group in Zurich which has a fixed

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:43,319
monthly meeting the is also a

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,159
french-speaking region of Switzerland

00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:49,379
and they have ad hoc meetings so maybe

00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:52,259
three or four times a year that someone

00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,900
calls for a dinner and they get together

00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,509
they all and those are all announced on

00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,599
the local mailing list and there's also

00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:03,569
a site that's run by the Linux user

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:05,310
groups of Switzerland and with a shared

00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:10,349
calendar where those events are

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:13,199
announced in the Washington DC area

00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:15,120
we've had occasional attack meeting is

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,310
no not so much lately I'm mostly just

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,979
when somebody else's somebody is coming

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,360
to town I've got a mailing list and an

00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,500
IRC channel though I don't know how

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:38,370
active the latter is because I don't

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:44,130
really do IRC much myself well we are I

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:46,949
am part of Catalan group but it's not a

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:51,659
local group because we we are all in

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:54,930
Catalonia and it's quite white where we

00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:57,930
are not doing a lot of things we started

00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:01,099
to we wanted to meet each six months

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:06,719
it's not a lot but it's not a city group

00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:09,750
but the last time we we couldn't do it

00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:13,349
and we wanted to we want to do it but we

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,870
have no efforts enough effort to and I

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:19,020
don't know how to because the promise

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:24,240
that at least in Catalonia Ubuntu has

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:26,279
local communities very strong and Debian

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:33,680
is like there are a lot of people but

00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:33,680
but we have no efforts to to move things

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,200
in the Washington DC area we've had one

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:50,200
or two um get together with you at the

00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,560
local open dope community as well but we

00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,810
haven't done that lately either so maybe

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,670
this is a since that question has come

00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,710
up of other kinds of groups happen and

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:02,440
so maybe that's a good moment compare

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:05,680
across there first of all this is what

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,570
the Debian local groups page has it has

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,600
this and then if you scroll down and

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:14,740
there's listed by continent and country

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,510
a kind of some text format standard form

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,730
there's no there's not really any clue

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,560
in any case whether this is recent

00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,600
information or was put there ten years

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,390
ago or whatever if you're if you're I'm

00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,090
not sure if you are a new potential

00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,100
contributor this is necessarily looks

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,540
particularly welcoming way to present it

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,780
but also it's not necessarily very

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:38,110
visible this is in the inner page of the

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,880
name local groups in the wiki but you

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:44,920
kind of need to know that exists to look

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:48,850
for it so for example Ubuntu as has been

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:53,160
mentioned pushes this somewhat more and

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:56,980
then again this um well it's nothing

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,960
this is not a kind of JavaScript filled

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,430
fancy website or anything it's not an

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,440
not only thing that Debian would project

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,080
necessarily but it's a bit more of a

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,200
welcoming format so one question is even

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,850
apart from changing what any groups are

00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,690
doing or encouraging more maybe we

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,700
should think about having a some more

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:21,250
friendly kind of pointers to there

00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:24,640
somehow actually sorry on a bun - is

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,080
anyone is anyone here experienced

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,150
slightly with what I've been to are

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,070
doing to comment on that because it has

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,300
been something that they've done much

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,480
more of trying to have these local

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,330
communities anyone that is anyone

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,690
willing to admit to knowing enough about

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,790
a vintage comment on that or the beer

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,769
you said you had some meetings with them

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:53,239
so maybe you know slightly

00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:59,329
I know who is not deeply mother what

00:09:53,239 --> 00:10:00,739
doctor I mean my understanding is it's

00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:04,730
really been a couple years I mean it

00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:08,769
just you know just hanging out so don't

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:13,129
give a lot of detail there sorry so

00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:16,029
again Fedora have a similar Kenny thing

00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:18,799
I should so one thing to note about both

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,449
yeah well for example for example with a

00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:24,499
boon to an Fedora is that they have a

00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:26,480
kind of more top as you might expect a

00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:28,249
more top-down hierarchical way of doing

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,709
this that they've divided up the world

00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:35,600
into kind of marketing territories and

00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:37,129
people are appointed to be in charge of

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,980
those territories and then they're

00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:43,519
allowed to authorize subgroups within

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,139
that and so forth I mean I think for for

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,220
maybe I don't know if any people

00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:48,319
disagree but I would have thought

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,619
probably for though we might want to

00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:52,639
have some more help towards local groups

00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:55,999
and so and I don't think we necessarily

00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,860
want to have that kind of structure for

00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:59,980
a debian thing I think it's more likely

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,869
we allow we just allow groups to develop

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,379
where people want them which again I

00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:07,850
mean it's also

00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:10,040
it will depend where in the world people

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,980
are what kind of wha-what is a local

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,709
group if you're in a place where there's

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,600
a huge number if you're in Germany where

00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,600
there's a lot of Debian developers then

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,569
probably people's local meeting might be

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,579
just their city if you're in a country

00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:28,189
where there's three developers in the

00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:30,259
whole country then probably the meaning

00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:37,569
of local in practice might become a bit

00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:40,579
different this is the information on KDE

00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:43,600
local community so actually we're not I

00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:45,709
wouldn't say we're the worst here

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,329
somewhere in actually yeah buried

00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,459
amongst this there is information on

00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:54,259
different countries but it looks a bit

00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:56,240
like it is doesn't it like just boring

00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:59,570
information

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,250
this is Arch Linux so again at least on

00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,500
one part of the website we can say we're

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,500
ahead of ashlynn XF and if not on some

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,910
of the documentation friends they just

00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:13,280
have they said they have a group in

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:17,060
probably a group in düsseldorf a group

00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:19,550
in Berlin and Luxembourg so again I mean

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,050
we're we're not doing so badly maybe

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:24,410
there are actually quite a lot of groups

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,550
it's just I think at the moment we don't

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,050
really it's not something that Debbie

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,400
and has really actively encouraged so

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,410
it's quite surprising that there are so

00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:35,420
many that claimed at least claiming to

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:40,190
exist currently so this is also some

00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:42,400
information from genome so one

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,830
interesting thing with them actually is

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,950
that they have unlike the other people a

00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,570
more clear guideline on what counts as a

00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,820
local group for them which is actually a

00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,520
question that would apply for comes up

00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,960
for Debian as well if you say if we so

00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,900
imagine we do want to encourage more

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,770
local Debian groups then you have to say

00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:07,420
well what what is it I mean we don't

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:10,370
probably we don't want to just become a

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,980
encyclopedia of existing Linux user

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,450
groups there's not much point just to

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,950
duplicate that information so you

00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,580
probably want to say there is something

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:22,310
that marks out a Debian local group as

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,890
being somehow connected with the Debian

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:29,840
not just people who like computers or

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:31,550
something so what what genome say is

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,180
where is it in here

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:39,140
yeah the groups must focus on the genome

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:42,110
or the growing community sorry it's just

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,730
a screenshot now I tried to make it big

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,680
bit apparently not big enough yeah I can

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:50,210
reload or something but I'm just reading

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,340
it out anyway so my net way what my

00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,720
Wi-Fi is there so terrible in here I

00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:58,100
took screenshots of the websites because

00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,570
like they're new I wouldn't work they

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,310
could be a separate organization that

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,870
they're allowed to be a subgroup of a

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:07,280
like for example but it has to have a

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:09,410
kind of visible existence of its own one

00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,790
that probably would share with dead with

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:14,980
what we might want for Debian is it

00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,980
should be somehow about free software

00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:21,649
then they say they want a contact person

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:23,600
and they should follow the the overall

00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,550
genome code of conduct so I mean somehow

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,589
there there is something we probably

00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,990
would follow more or less if we wanted

00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:32,629
to set ideas about what a debian group

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:38,420
might be and the same kind of parallel

00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:39,619
so stepping it to a different side from

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,839
them and when one question is it will

00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:44,300
again some of these groups that may or

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:49,009
may not exist at the moment do you have

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:50,779
regular or physical meetings and it does

00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,910
seem to be that where that happens it's

00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,290
it's kind of useful thing although other

00:14:52,910 --> 00:15:04,249
ones just have a Mendez for example

00:14:54,290 --> 00:15:08,209
there's someone everyone I'm a bit out

00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:09,649
of breath I sorry I was late maybe

00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:10,730
thanks to the video team because I was

00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:12,459
listening to the sleep the whole time

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:17,389
yeah while driving

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:20,629
emphasis on listening so I was part of

00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:24,230
the cofounders of the Ubuntu local team

00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:27,040
here in Quebec which grew to around 300

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,299
people at every release party was crazy

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,540
and I started a few others in other

00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:34,179
countries I'm originally from Columbia

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:38,929
and so I'm trying to apply all that

00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:41,319
experience and knowledge and partying to

00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:43,819
getting together a welcome team for

00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:47,829
Debian and there is a BF right after

00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:49,879
this in woody if you're interested so

00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:51,259
regarding physical meetings I think

00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,079
that's the most important the single

00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:56,240
most important part and in a bun - at

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,119
some point even if you think the Ubuntu

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,869
was very strong and very wide and

00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:05,629
accepting and including and we reached a

00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:08,329
limit where people wouldn't come for to

00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:13,100
our events to geek out and bring their

00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:15,139
laptops and and and show off and so on

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,410
and it was very welcoming you know

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:21,589
family friendly as we said but I came up

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,329
with a very simple idea that seemed

00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:26,940
absurd at the time and has grown quite a

00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:30,270
bit and it's the the Ubuntu our

00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:34,110
and so we removed everything so we kind

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:35,670
of joked about this and we said what do

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,710
we hate the most when we go to one of

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,900
these meetings even if we love seeing

00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,520
new people and people we know and

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,140
getting together and sharing and so on

00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,550
and for some of us was the time we

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,340
started to grow up and get older and get

00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,110
families and other responsibilities for

00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,720
some other people was just a geeking

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:58,830
aspect of it you know they hate having

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,170
to share or even pretend that they know

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,940
anything about anything some people just

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,520
know absolutely nothing about it and

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,020
they're just curious you know the

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,900
relatives their family the colleagues

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:14,520
and so you went to our had I think or

00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,560
still has three requirements was try not

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:23,100
to bring any machines

00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:28,110
it's only an hour and it can be one

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:31,980
person so and my initial premise was if

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:34,440
you're just two people anywhere using a

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,990
bun - that's it you're a team you're a

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,290
team of two I mean is someone else

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,360
joints well they're near three that's a

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:45,570
thirty percent 33 percent increase and

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,270
so on and so forth and if no one else

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,400
joins then that's it you have an hour of

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:53,100
peace and self introspections and

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,960
whatever and you leave and that's it and

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:59,430
the only other thing was to repeat this

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,380
on a weekly or monthly basis it's just

00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,030
weird how people just add up to this and

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,600
canonical made it an official resource

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:08,790
and now there is a tool to add your own

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:13,200
or bun to ours and whatever it started

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:16,890
as a wiki so my first suggestion would

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,540
be if we're going to go to the towards

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,410
the social solution for this problem

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:24,540
would be keep it very very very simple

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,640
even the signs all that stuff that comes

00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,820
with organizing something having coffee

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,560
food and so on don't worry just just

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,920
advertise you you are going to be

00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,830
available for one hour wherever and we

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,160
actually had one two hours in

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,860
neighborhoods

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,260
forget about countries it was like

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,880
there's Ubuntu mantra Montreal our in

00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,679
this neighborhood and in this other and

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,179
people loved it because they didn't even

00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,230
have to take the bus or anything like

00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:53,790
that so yeah if anyone's interested I

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:57,299
almost forgot about local groups in our

00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:59,730
BOF there's no mention of it and I just

00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:01,260
noticed this this morning so yeah come

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,360
come and see me and I'm gonna be here

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,770
until I mean I live here in Montreal so

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,140
I'm gonna be at least you're a typical

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,090
until Saturday but it's let's meet and

00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,900
chat I mean certainly I thought I seen

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:14,309
that for a couple of the Debian local

00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,179
meetings that do go on where it's just

00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:20,640
seems to if someone can say once a month

00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:23,070
they're going to be in this cafe at this

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,700
time whatever and that person just makes

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,770
a commitment to go then something will

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,299
write in actually we actually even

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,090
removed a commitment part of what you

00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,919
just said and sometimes I wouldn't show

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,720
to my own abouttwo our thing in my

00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,730
neighborhood and people would go sure

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,210
and just because two people would show

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:44,880
up and they knew yeah I think if there's

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,910
only one new person who shows up then

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,179
they may feel a bit lost but yeah and if

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,500
you look at it boon to thinking back

00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:55,890
something that feels contrary to the

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:59,130
Debian community is everyone to team had

00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:01,020
a team lead and co-lead and in people

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,880
that were clearly like kind of above

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:07,230
everyone else do you think that's useful

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,780
or it takes someone to do the dirty job

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,370
at the beginning I think and and

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,059
canonical actually got people to do a

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:18,059
lot of things with t-shirts and free CDs

00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:21,809
a lot of things and then that worked

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:24,570
yeah oh and the stickers so yeah those

00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:26,730
three things were huge so can we get

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,350
sponsors to give us that and start the

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,950
Debian hour or something like that I'm

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,850
thinking about it I mean another thing

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,860
again I think what you're saying about

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,660
having it every week or every month

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,540
whatever is certainly I know myself when

00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,860
I see four other four non Debian things

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,230
other groups happening in Edinburgh say

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,120
quite often I see the meeting oft it

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,950
already happened but if I know there's

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,809
another one in a month time for example

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,059
I can put that in the my diary and

00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:52,650
attempt to remember at that time if it's

00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,370
just a what if it's only ever one-off

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:58,059
things you it's very it's kind of hard

00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:00,460
get involved and can I just respond to

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:03,549
that just on the idea of a team laid in

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:06,340
Debian someone can lead something just

00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:08,770
for one meeting yeah when my array

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,690
stands up here today for an hour he's

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,270
leading this event but someone else

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:16,600
might propose an event on the same topic

00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,940
at the next step conf so it's not that

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,130
we don't have people leading things it's

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,909
just the duration of that role isn't

00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,919
fixed or formal but leadership still

00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:29,770
happens in Debian just in a different

00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,710
way and I just wanted to suggest

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,929
bringing up the website used to

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,220
advertise the events in Switzerland do

00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:52,419
you want to bring up your browser and

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:53,370
I'll give you a fright terming dot CH FR

00:21:52,419 --> 00:22:01,630
e IE

00:21:53,370 --> 00:22:12,659
turn deutsch so fr e IE - terming te RM

00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:17,590
i n a dot CH oh it's working yes and

00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:20,860
well so if you go to the right on the

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,630
right hand side there's a key with the

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,539
different colors what they mean so

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:28,179
there's a color for Debian tref tref is

00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:31,360
German for meeting so Debbie and ref is

00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:35,500
Debian meeting Zurich and there's

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,419
another color for fsfe meeting so each

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,610
one has their color and if you look in

00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:43,390
the calendar you can see them you can go

00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:46,899
forward a month further down on the

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:49,620
right there's a filter and you can get

00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:52,480
it in iCalendar format into your

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,299
Thunderbird or into your phone or

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,750
whatever you use and so this is just one

00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:01,270
example in the german-speaking region of

00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,640
Switzerland but this could be copied by

00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,430
groups that want to do this but I mean

00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:11,010
for me personally

00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:12,900
I am not a person that goes to a meeting

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,660
at a fixed time every month and it's the

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,670
same with other things like I don't

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:20,040
commit to going to like a class at the

00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:22,470
gym at a fixed time every month I prefer

00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,900
to to do what I'm doing and then

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,850
whenever I finish that day I'll go out

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,880
on my bike or something I don't have a

00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:32,460
fixed time for doing something like that

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,050
I like to have flexibility and there are

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,260
some people in the community that have

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:39,450
the same feeling with Debian that they

00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,130
just do the Debian stuff when they when

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,860
they feel like doing Debbie and stuff

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:46,460
other people like to have a structure

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,050
like this to have a monthly activity and

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,710
so the same thing won't work for

00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,500
everyone

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,180
some new participants may also like

00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,250
being able to look at something like

00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,290
this and see where they can join very

00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:01,680
quickly even without being on the

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:04,410
mailing list so some people are afraid

00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,140
to send an email asking for key signing

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,940
or to say that they're visiting but if

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,220
they see something like this and they

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:17,280
can see where they might meet people

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:19,200
they'll just show up yeah and has anyone

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,990
else seen anything like this in other

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,300
regions this kind of calendar you mean

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,540
yes we have some there is something like

00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,960
it at Edinboro suddenly one other idea I

00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:33,420
had just with that is that maybe some

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,090
tools like say the wiki that we use for

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:38,580
Debian could maybe someone could develop

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,980
a plugin for events so that when people

00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,590
put events in the wiki it would generate

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:47,790
an IEEE calendar output that could be

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:50,310
aggregated by sites like this can you

00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:53,550
bring back your browser since it seems

00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:58,590
it's working just open a new tab and

00:24:53,550 --> 00:25:06,330
hell yeah let's try this agenda in

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:14,940
French yeah a GE and da Jie sorry nut je

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:21,690
oh I can't see D u li BR e

00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:25,029
so as endowed libera that QC that CA and

00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:28,270
this country level domain name can't be

00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:30,880
registering anymore it's for Kippur so

00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,590
this is pretty much the same and well

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,130
very similar to me if you scroll down

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,130
completely

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,970
there's tags in the middle of the page

00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:43,299
yeah at the bottom in their middle yeah

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:49,210
so kind of like what you said for the

00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:52,090
colors and at the very top of it you

00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:55,390
will notice there is Switzerland at the

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:58,630
right and I I'm pretty sure it's empty

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:03,399
because it's French Swiss so we should

00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:06,549
talk recently and there is a Free

00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:08,049
Software Foundation mailing list I can't

00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:11,110
remember the exact list but there's a

00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:13,149
big discussion thread about centralizing

00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:16,809
the free software activities calendars

00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:21,460
and what you see here was originally

00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:24,880
started in France in Quebec province we

00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:26,890
rewrote it of course and then we went

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,049
back upstream and then we combined their

00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,330
source code and there's a whole history

00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:33,399
of collaboration here but we should

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,779
probably talk about doing something

00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:36,640
together but I mean I think it's

00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:38,590
interesting also that this is free

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,270
software focused because again the kind

00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,890
of manager of this as it exists in

00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,559
Edinburgh there's a lot of events that

00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:46,960
kind of every day of the month you know

00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:48,669
anything but very there's really nothing

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,059
none of them that are actually focused

00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:54,279
on the issues of freedom and so on so

00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:57,130
this includes everything free software

00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:59,320
and the guidelines are pretty strict but

00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,360
at the same time if you're talking about

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,130
the subject that covers 90% social

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,409
issues and there's ten percents free

00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:09,250
software related it'll get him yeah but

00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:10,840
I mean a lot of a lot of big meetings of

00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,210
this type that happen even if it happens

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,039
to be about a free programming language

00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,380
or so and people and just not interested

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,720
in these issues so the fact of Bridgette

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,240
even if it's that the the group has some

00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,090
recognized interest in that area it's

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,180
different from yeah I'll tell you what

00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,830
it took to to get the the

00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,750
calendar as full as you see it for the

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,110
past week even though most of it is Deb

00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:35,730
Kampf this week as a president and as a

00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,700
member of the organization behind this

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:41,100
and a bunch of people maybe 10 or 10 to

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,560
15 we had to attend every single

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,980
free-software event that showed up

00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:49,530
anywhere in the Raider for five six

00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,220
times over a year or two let them know

00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,040
about this

00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,950
and almost begged them to put their

00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,690
events in it was very very very hard and

00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,160
I think it's also apart from people be

00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,690
able to see if future events the fact

00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,150
that you can if you can for any

00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,190
individual group being able to see the

00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,900
history of events also makes again if

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,480
you're a new potential new person you

00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,060
have a feeling this is a an active group

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,560
it friend of more comforting to join it

00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,290
rather than that you think your turn up

00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,270
and it won't really happen or yeah and

00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,000
then it helped a lot that we were able

00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:24,030
to burst out of our comfort comfort zone

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,460
and bubble and you know I'm not a fedora

00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,350
user so what let's see these people

00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,220
let's meet them and let's go to their

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:37,140
place and invite them over and it's

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:39,510
really worked out well I think one other

00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:43,650
thing is communication I mean just

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:46,290
communicating that meetups exist for

00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:48,780
Debian that is I think also key like for

00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:51,300
example the OpenStreetMap community they

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,040
have a regular newsletter that kind of

00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:58,020
summarizes what happens in the community

00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:59,910
like it's called weekly osm and they

00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,090
always they also have a calendar that

00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:04,860
passes the wiki page with all events and

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,930
that just creates a lot of

00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,300
discoverability you see like oh there is

00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,680
a there are people meeting in Montreal

00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,850
there are people meeting in Stockholm

00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:17,190
wherever and I think that is also key to

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:21,300
motivate others to well why I should

00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:24,360
maybe start one as well mm-hmm so this

00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:27,270
is something maybe if we create such a

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,570
solution to connect with a publicity

00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:33,420
team to to put that in bits and debian

00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:36,840
or something like that so I mean quickly

00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:39,540
does anyone have any thing they want to

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,010
say about who we imagined that we were

00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,660
making a new site

00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,580
maybe take sufficient in the wiki or

00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,130
whatever it does but was making this

00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,870
more visible

00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:51,120
what does anyone have any opinion that

00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,650
they want to mention on what should be

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,250
listed there or what should be allowed

00:29:52,650 --> 00:30:01,860
to be listed I mean how do we define

00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:03,510
what is a debian group or source or do

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,190
we just say we take roughly what the gun

00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,770
and people had and replace you know with

00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:10,950
Debian for example I'd be comfortable

00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:13,050
with with any group where people will be

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,810
made to feel welcome where they can ask

00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:17,970
questions about Debian where they can

00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:20,640
get help to install Debian so whether

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:24,180
it's a debian group whether there's a

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,040
Debian developer or not and if people

00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,590
have a question about Debian and they

00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:32,010
can go to that meeting and hopefully get

00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:40,620
an A+ reply and then I think that would

00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:43,050
be a group that we should list yeah it's

00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,610
it's all points this all points to the

00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,830
Welcome team I think because we already

00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:50,100
have a well we have a couple of people

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:53,400
and I'm one of the contacts and we're

00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:55,650
trying to improve the newcomer

00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,600
experience in to me someone new doesn't

00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,720
necessarily mean someone new to free

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,400
software it's also someone new to the

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,370
developer community so you may be a

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,460
developer elsewhere but now you want to

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,510
come here and you're curious or someone

00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,540
that has no technical background

00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:14,610
whatsoever and then the first contact

00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,850
should be actionable and really quick

00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,920
response that's what happens in Ubuntu

00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,510
you want to join the community you

00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,570
create your account you log in you're

00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,860
translating in like five minutes your

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:28,020
weekly editing in like another five

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,730
minutes and you'll find your parties and

00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,460
people and everything in like the next

00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:35,370
ten minutes finding the people I think

00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,890
is the key place that is missing if you

00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:40,170
know how to do wiki editing and and how

00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:41,730
to report bugs I'm fairly comfortable

00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,100
you're gonna find your way around in

00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,410
Debian but if you want to find the

00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,330
people it's another story some teams are

00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,760
really clearly identified with contacts

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,330
and everything some others are not and

00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,809
that

00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:56,559
there were a few talks about teams

00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:58,179
communicating with each other being

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,900
difficult at some point so I think

00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:04,030
that's one of the parts so if anyone

00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,770
wants to start a group that person

00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,140
should find within five minutes of

00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:11,530
getting to Debian Derek how to do just

00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:17,110
that even if they know nothing else

00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:18,789
about Debian I don't know what's I was

00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,530
waiting listening over streaming about

00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:24,640
some of the people that had meetings

00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:28,870
elsewhere someone mentioned Catania

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,840
right was you maybe you can share with

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:33,700
us how did you find out about the local

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:44,890
meetings or do you have going to people

00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:47,860
or other people there maybe well the the

00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:51,580
local group in Catalonia started because

00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:54,070
of the Debian user Catalan list and yes

00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:56,919
the mailing list so from there some

00:32:54,070 --> 00:33:00,820
people some of our fans we note each

00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:05,140
other and we decided to meet physically

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:08,650
and from here we started to meet more

00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:13,270
regularly but lately if sadly we are not

00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:15,700
doing so much well the last the last in

00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:18,490
the last day was we do a release party

00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:23,080
but it was not a party was a hiking I

00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:26,289
mean I agree with you that that you

00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,539
don't have sometimes it's more to to get

00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:32,860
in touch with people more than to do a

00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:37,330
very techie torx for instance because we

00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:40,510
can do it virtually but the history of

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:43,000
cattle of Catalan group was this that we

00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,309
wanted to we were talking about things

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,870
of Rome things in the list and and then

00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:51,309
become the the local group in fact we

00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:54,610
registered as a local group not long

00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:57,340
time ago but we were we were the group

00:33:54,610 --> 00:34:03,130
before you register it it because we

00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:05,740
were doing things and some talks but not

00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:09,110
with our very regular

00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:11,720
so I mean for making groups more visible

00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:14,330
one thing maybe has been mentioned is to

00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,400
try to have ongoing meetings that could

00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:20,630
be only I mean in some place even if

00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:22,070
it's only you say you have a some

00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,240
meeting every summer or something at

00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:26,020
least the fact that there's something on

00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,730
the webpage to say that it's still alive

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,380
I think is reassuring to people for who

00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,760
it gives them a reason to contact to

00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,429
bother contracting the group if they

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,750
find out about it I mean I don't know

00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,490
what else people think would be good

00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,020
again one thing I haven't put on this

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:43,340
slide I think I imagine somewhere else

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:45,260
is probably nowadays the same kind of

00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,669
information as well as well as mailing

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,110
less and so on we probably ought to be

00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:51,200
trying to feed this information out to

00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:53,500
the various types of social media that

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,770
people find things on nowadays as well

00:34:53,500 --> 00:35:01,130
if you want the Debian Catalan user

00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:02,390
group we have a wiki page entry but I

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,270
don't know if it's the best

00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:16,040
if you wonder one showing I don't know

00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:19,550
if it's the best example I am Kathy

00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,980
sitter in observing the community over

00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:25,450
about a decade from a distance not

00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:28,310
making big efforts to be involved I

00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:30,110
often think it might be helpful maybe in

00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:33,260
future conversations to talk about what

00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:36,830
would be lost if the all the groups

00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:40,120
became more open and that's a good way

00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:42,950
of discovering why they're not opening

00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,960
so there's an interesting social trust

00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,970
that's built up and it gets disrupted

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,850
when you have events where you need to

00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,050
be nice to a lot of people and the

00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:54,140
building up of those close relationships

00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,940
can be very crucial and I'm not saying

00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,270
that that Debian shouldn't open up I'm

00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:01,610
just saying it's a it's a workload it's

00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:04,880
an issue on that maybe as well as how

00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:06,530
you how we I mean if we were if we were

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,300
trying to start and say how should we

00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:11,600
actually market these things or brand

00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,580
them then there is a big there is a

00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,290
fundamental question which at the moment

00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,880
we haven't really dealt with because in

00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,619
most places we haven't been trying to

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,960
push these groups very much anyway

00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:22,430
but are these like who's the who is

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,670
there - are they targeted to that and

00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:27,349
that probably mean for a lot of what

00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:29,690
we've been discussing here we've kind of

00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:31,849
been thinking about targeting at people

00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:34,640
who want to be Debian contributors in

00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:37,599
some way and maybe that is the right

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,279
thing to do a different possibility

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,509
which summer some groups have pushed

00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:44,299
much more in different parts of the

00:36:41,509 --> 00:36:47,630
world is just to be about encouraging

00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:51,349
using Debian and trying to have more

00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:52,819
public facing events with well again in

00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:56,599
Catalonia there have been events with

00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:58,099
different days of talks and so on again

00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,890
both things can work but again they are

00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:04,400
slightly different and so from outside I

00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:06,650
see that there's a duoc recei instituted

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,650
to the extent that a person has to show

00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:11,779
that they will contribute and are

00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:15,049
contributing before someone who needs

00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:17,029
their contributions we'll take take the

00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:19,819
time and energy to make more personal

00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:22,430
connection with them and so I think

00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:25,160
that's not a bad thing it just has this

00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:27,499
trade-off of being difficult for new

00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,980
people I could see - I mean I can see to

00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:33,140
some degree that the for me the the kind

00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,989
of contributor focus has some validity

00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,309
in the sense that in most parts of the

00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:40,489
world there already are

00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:42,559
for example Linux users groups so again

00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:45,499
there's not much point trying to

00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:48,019
duplicate that exactly and I don't say

00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:50,539
is bad if people who are just a user it

00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:52,999
turn up to a meeting but it's still it's

00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:56,509
not clear to me that trying to create a

00:37:52,999 --> 00:38:04,609
new set of Linux user groups purely

00:37:56,509 --> 00:38:06,950
focused on Debian would help anyone yeah

00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:08,599
that's it that's something we were

00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,730
confronted a lot here in Quebec because

00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,549
there was a very strong community of

00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:16,759
free software users all kinds of

00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:20,210
different users and maybe we can draw a

00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:23,140
parallel with programming community so

00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:25,249
there's our all kind of groups here now

00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,640
gravitating out so there's Python

00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:29,360
Montreal there is a group about

00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,390
JavaScript there is

00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,610
a bunch of other web developers and and

00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:37,220
focusing on different technologies and

00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:41,000
some user groups really focusing around

00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:43,460
the one specific tool and probably the

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,130
only problem is is when they have

00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:48,890
meetings at the same time and in some

00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:52,970
occasions we have done for example the

00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:55,310
club in Exeter make meetings have been

00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,890
focusing on one distribution or the

00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:00,130
other and we show up and we do demos and

00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:04,070
so on and I don't think it's a huge

00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:05,980
problem it most probably someone in

00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:08,540
marketing would tell you well there's

00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,220
the brand is not clear or you're not

00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:14,030
respecting this or this kind of rule for

00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:16,070
my typical marketing but as I said

00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:19,160
before I think you need a group of one

00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:21,350
and if you start with that you'll

00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,960
discover it if you remain a group of one

00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:26,210
after three years well maybe there is no

00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,610
point in putting such effort if your

00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,940
group of one grows to 200 in a couple of

00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,820
months

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:34,070
well maybe you do need a structure and a

00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:36,770
lead and resources and I don't know

00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:39,590
other stuff so so one other question

00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:43,850
that you were implicitly raising before

00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:45,320
is what can defiantly effectively do to

00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:47,770
help any of these groups if they wanted

00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,880
I mean so clearly at the moment we are

00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:52,610
providing a minimal level of

00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,100
infrastructure in that people can put

00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:56,750
their entries in a wiki they can get

00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:59,450
mailing lists if they want to and so on

00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,920
I think one thing we're not really doing

00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,260
at the moment that has been mentioned as

00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,690
probably we should try more to somehow

00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,790
aggregate the event information and push

00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:09,380
it out again it's not it's not

00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:11,270
necessarily the case that that's going

00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:15,020
to be how you actually get the attendees

00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:16,730
because they might get it by searching

00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,560
directly for something in their City

00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,690
rather than by seeing in the Jeff

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,760
central Debian news but some people will

00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,250
see it that way and it also just gives a

00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:28,070
feeling of life I think somehow right

00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,630
but then there's discoverability if I'm

00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:31,010
in Montreal I'm very interested in

00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:36,110
knowing if there's people in Sherbrooke

00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:38,090
Ottawa Boston New York yeah why not add

00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:41,810
a trip to go see the other guys next

00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:42,740
door in Ubuntu I think one thing that

00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,960
helped

00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:49,760
initially other than giving away free

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:52,849
stuff was having clear branding

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,920
guidelines so and I think that's done

00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:56,750
with Debian it's clear that we can use

00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,990
the logo for this or this or it isn't

00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:01,910
that perhaps clarifying a bit more in a

00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:05,750
context of local groups would be nice

00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:07,940
and you'd be amazed how many people just

00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,839
print out stuff make t-shirts and give

00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:13,400
them away for free on your behalf

00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:15,109
without you asking them just making the

00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:19,790
logo available that's one thing I

00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:22,280
remember and the other thing was let's

00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:24,200
not put the weight on the publicity or

00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,910
marketing team to discover stuff and

00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:30,650
aggregated but let's let's help them

00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:34,700
make available a way to send them the

00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:38,900
information easily and I call RSS or

00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:41,109
whatever text for calendar yeah I think

00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,089
we should we should have a way to

00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:47,300
extract our debian events and if we

00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:48,920
start just with us - and we'll probably

00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,869
find that other people are doing the

00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,660
same thing and probably get a nice list

00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:55,730
by a couple of months and then they

00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,460
discover each other and I don't know and

00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:00,380
do people think that there is that it

00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,330
would be useful for Debian to spend

00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,180
money on these things somehow and if we

00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:07,640
did spend money what would it before

00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:10,130
well I would I wish I would have known

00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,020
how to invite other people to Debian

00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:15,680
camp for example the week before Deb

00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,570
camp is a huge you know it's an

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,750
opportunity we could take more advantage

00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:22,520
of and if I'm going to Taiwan next year

00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,980
I'll probably get there a week earlier

00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,160
and set up a help desk and meet the

00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:31,160
users and so on and so forth so by the

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,140
end of week of Deb Kampf 18 we know

00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,359
there is an organized group and if there

00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:38,000
isn't then there is probably no point

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,680
but at least put their resources there

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,450
and some time to do it while at that

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:47,420
conf yeah just on that question of money

00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:51,410
one thing I'd suggest this roll up

00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:53,300
banner next to marae is I've got three

00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:55,700
of those just with the Debian logo on

00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,869
them and they were actually produced for

00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,119
us by the fahsai

00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:02,809
they produced a whole batch of them in

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:05,569
Singapore and so I just take one along

00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:07,789
when I go somewhere and I put it up it

00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:10,579
wouldn't be hard to get a couple of

00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:12,529
those made for every developer so

00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:15,799
whenever someone shows up somewhere they

00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:18,470
just put it up even if it's not strictly

00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:21,230
a Debian event maybe they've got a table

00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:24,680
somewhere maybe it's a ham radio event I

00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:30,529
go to some of those as well so that's

00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:33,619
just one possibility and on the the

00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:35,509
question of social media this keeps

00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:38,210
coming up in different forums and there

00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:40,609
are some people who feel that you can't

00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,079
do anything without social media these

00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:44,539
days and there are other people who

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,390
really push back on it for various

00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:50,599
reasons including the privacy the fact

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:53,599
that it has non free JavaScript and what

00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:56,180
have you now I've been to many events

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,789
this year where I've met new people who

00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:03,230
have never met through Debian or free

00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:05,359
software and every time I go to an event

00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:07,809
I find out about at least two more

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:11,539
events without using any social media

00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:13,339
and in several cases people have asked

00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:17,720
me to come and talk at their next event

00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:19,700
or another event they know about so so I

00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,619
don't think we need to be dependent on

00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:24,579
social media now some people might

00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:27,499
choose to use it and yeah being a free

00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:28,940
organisation we can't stop people using

00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:32,089
their browser to browse to a

00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:35,420
facebook.com/ I don't personally do that

00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:37,670
myself and but yeah we need to look at

00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,710
all the the alternatives there and

00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:43,849
really going out to events that are

00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:47,359
outside our comfort zone is quite

00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:50,660
significant I went to an event in kotor

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:53,720
recently which is the digital born media

00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:56,720
carnival there are only a very small

00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:59,650
number of IT or developer people there

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,940
and mostly it was journalists lawyers

00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,550
policymakers researchers and academics

00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,320
and

00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:07,840
so it's really interesting to have

00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:10,600
two-way conversations with these people

00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,700
so and find out just how they perceive

00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:17,380
what we do some of them were really

00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:19,060
clued in some of them you know they you

00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,280
realize that the messages are not

00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:24,100
reaching them and we have to work harder

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,350
to get the messages out there about free

00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:28,630
software mass surveillance and all these

00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:31,090
issues but you only get that by the

00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:33,220
interaction with people the social media

00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:34,690
is one way and sometimes it's not even

00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:43,240
one way you put it out there and it

00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:45,750
never even reaches anyone at all and any

00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:49,240
other topics people think we should be

00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:52,680
mentioning just to your slide previous

00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:55,060
slides about note one before so you were

00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,610
visibility about the wiki page so I

00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:01,290
think one big difference between the

00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:05,050
pages you showed is also you have the

00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:06,790
world map I think it would be really

00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:08,830
nice to have something like this on the

00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:10,510
wiki page so it's really like friendly

00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,900
and you see how there are many groups

00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:15,790
and then you scroll down because and

00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,670
down on the wiki page you really find

00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:21,220
information about groups I looked it up

00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,410
before it I think for me it's really

00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:26,380
nice if I want to get in contact with

00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:28,840
somebody I can find this but also maybe

00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:32,800
include some information for people who

00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:35,380
want to make group like it's easy or

00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,400
even when you say about money or about

00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:42,910
roll-ups include to stare to show people

00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:48,540
who have already a group want to do more

00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:48,540
publicity that it's easy to get stuff

00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:56,890
also I've been to some tech meetings and

00:46:54,310 --> 00:47:00,040
I see what people like is also to have

00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:01,990
some free food and beer so I'm not

00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,570
saying that's also a way but also it's

00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:07,960
an engaging way for people to to go and

00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:10,450
to attend and I know that not everybody

00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:14,830
might like it but sometimes it's an

00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:17,250
encouraging thing to go so maybe I don't

00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:20,230
know who needs to sponsor that or where

00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:22,690
it's a good idea to nestle Debian to

00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:37,270
sponsor that but it's another way to

00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:39,370
encourage people to go and socialize so

00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:42,760
I I think I need everyone in this room

00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:45,640
to follow me to the Welcome BOF right

00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:48,670
after this because the ideas I have are

00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:51,430
completely on another level and this

00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:55,960
seems more to the point of welcoming new

00:47:51,430 --> 00:48:00,490
people so yeah if you're with me follow

00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:04,240
me after this but uh yeah regarding the

00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:06,430
money I think it's a it's it's a strange

00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,470
thing because when you don't have it you

00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:13,210
need it and when you have it you wish

00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:16,420
you didn't need it and it it kind of

00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:19,090
makes things more complicated in many

00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:23,020
levels but sponsorship I think it's a

00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:25,450
it's a good way to make it simple if if

00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:27,610
someone wants to organize this and and

00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:30,580
they're willing to sponsor it or they

00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:33,100
need the money one thing that has worked

00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:35,110
a lot in Quebec here and that I made

00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,080
sure in organizations when I was

00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:40,090
involved in that capacity for example I

00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:43,920
would hear some people saying we're

00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:46,990
going to do an open street map party and

00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,610
mapping the neighbourhood how can we get

00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,410
more people and they said well we wish

00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:52,930
we had money for this well did you ask

00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:55,870
around oh no not really

00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:59,080
so don't hesitate to ask your local free

00:48:55,870 --> 00:49:01,020
software or tech group or even the

00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:04,540
electronic shop around the corner

00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:06,400
sometimes with fifty euros dollars you

00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,860
can get a couple of free pizzas and

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,440
maybe get more mappers or more Debian

00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:14,560
users or whatever I know here in Quebec

00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,050
there's a few places you can ask but if

00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,940
you haven't asked yourself that before

00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:20,740
today just think about all the people

00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:25,000
gravitating around your community that

00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:26,230
could throw in a few bucks maybe even

00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,510
family

00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:31,060
I don't know and is there other people

00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:33,609
here who are not currently going to a

00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,920
regular Debian meeting say but would be

00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:41,650
willing to do to try and create one

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:43,810
where they're living or I mean what if

00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:46,330
you put your hand up then there's other

00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:48,730
things that you think would help you do

00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:57,430
that or is just about you getting run to

00:49:48,730 --> 00:50:00,040
it so I live with a developer we talk

00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:03,190
about Debian all the time we have local

00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:07,710
WWE developers in the Portland area and

00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:09,670
Seattle so basically if someone

00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:12,570
internationally is coming to Portland

00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:15,580
they'll say something on IRC and then

00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:17,200
hopefully someone will propose that we

00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:20,859
all meet together and it might be a

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,690
group of from 3 to 15 people will come

00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:24,730
and greet that person and say hey what's

00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,280
up since we last saw you and then

00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:29,530
there'll be technical conversations and

00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,850
that really is the extent that I see of

00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:37,210
social of Debian social in Portland I

00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:39,490
don't make an effort to help because

00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:42,910
I've found that I get thrown into the

00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:45,280
girl jobs which I don't enjoy and that

00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:49,300
is I said you know I see a bug squashing

00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,460
party and no one has arranged chairs or

00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,830
cleaned or made sure there was some food

00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,780
to eat or water that people and people

00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:58,359
start getting old cranky and

00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:01,210
uncomfortable and then I go and then I

00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:03,310
end up being the girl and so I I just I

00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:06,300
just watch and I and I enjoy the

00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,300
conversations as they come up

00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:23,289
I live in Brazil and I participate in

00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:25,750
groups and social movements that we

00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:31,509
never had money to do anything and

00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:34,509
things just happen and but it I have

00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:38,109
been doing some workshops about Linux

00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:40,180
and install fast with on Debian so for

00:51:38,109 --> 00:51:42,160
me it would be really good if there is

00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,440
other people doing that in Brazil that I

00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,420
can meet and we can talk about that

00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,809
what's good what's not good

00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:54,599
they space that why we can use to do

00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:54,599
that so that's what I'm looking for so

00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:00,369
[Laughter]

00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:02,980
unless someone wants just add something

00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:10,809
urgently I guess that's there's one hand

00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:13,269
up over here I'm from Delhi India and I

00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:17,019
think the problem which I face is that I

00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:19,990
don't have a you know I don't know much

00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:23,440
people who are Debian developers in my

00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:25,839
area and even if I goo goo goo Debian

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,809
India and there is not a proper list of

00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:32,980
people who are there near me and I go to

00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:35,259
meetups and I meet people in open-source

00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:38,920
but it is very hard to meet Debian

00:52:35,259 --> 00:52:42,009
developers in my area and if I and the

00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:45,730
last conferences which I see in India

00:52:42,009 --> 00:52:48,460
are very like around 2006 and so there

00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:50,680
is not a proper updated list of Debian

00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:53,559
developers in my area and even if there

00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:55,359
are five people around and we can just

00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:57,309
meet up and discuss about Debian

00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:59,920
projects I think that is what I am

00:52:57,309 --> 00:53:02,950
looking for so hopefully some of us can

00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,619
carry on discussing these issues and

00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:07,240
including apparently in this session in

00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:08,650
the other room in some does anyone know

00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,309
where this other welcome session is

00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:16,210
welcome discussion meeting is happening

00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:17,950
woody maybe well somewhere else exactly

00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:19,599
but I think we should wrap up for now

00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:21,520
and hopefully we can carry on discussing

00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,580
thank you

00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,580
you

00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,260
