welcome to the top 17 opening ceremony

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,549
thanks for being here

00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:26,070
the original title for the stock was

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,930
hastily prepared the station by 65 acres

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,290
but should they that didn't cut it with

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,629
the content team it wasn't done distinct

00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,540
enough from the other presentation who

00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:38,460
started that comma so here we go welcome

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:44,040
to Montreal it's really great to see you

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:47,550
all in our hometown the though the

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,160
weather forecast for this week severe

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,160
thunderstorms / rainfall overwhelming

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,560
heat and humidity and I'm only talking

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,630
about this morning so check the weather

00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,160
for this afternoon in the following days

00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,750
no but seriously the weather could be

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,729
sometimes a little extreme in Montreal

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,500
in the middle of summer like like now so

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,380
make sure to check the weather before

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,149
wandering outside the walls of the venue

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,430
and it may not matter because it

00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:18,360
shouldn't green be a you might not want

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,539
to go outside

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,510
I'm told they should rain inside most of

00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:26,360
the hatbox

00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:31,960
I hope you got your that in umbrella

00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,960
from from our folks from Debbie th

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,600
before moving on to other subjects in

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,940
this presentation we want to first such

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,880
a little bit on the Debian and DEF CON

00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,610
codes of conduct we realize it's a

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,190
little bit heavy heavy stuff it's early

00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,800
in the morning so for some of us but

00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,500
it's something we really wanted to do

00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,320
it's quite important to us if you're

00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,240
sitting in this room you should really

00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:07,100
already be familiar with it calm and the

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:10,330
Debian codes of conduct you know so if

00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:13,070
you if you're not yeah can see this

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,110
haven't heard of these before that's

00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:18,200
really your first assignment after this

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,800

these rules everywhere with everyone for

and then listening to and being

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,370
attentive to the person's responding can

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:49,769
make a big difference that Indian is a

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,260
huge and diverse community and even

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,659
though we're all here together now we

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,669
should keep in mind that Def Con

00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:22,019

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:14,720
write evil to the event to harassment to

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:17,510
that deputy Doctore dress so here we

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,260
have her my name is Jerome

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:25,340
Lamine on IRC for those who've seen a

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:30,050
couple messages on that channels this is

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:33,920
repeated a cake oil lvl the detain of

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:37,130
death and Tiago and we should also

00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,320
mention tawa might you might have

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,540
probably met actually probably check you

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,630
in when you came in at the front desk

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:49,490
and as well as sassy albums firstly not

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:52,910
in Montreal these days so I wanted also

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,030
to begin by talking about like why we

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,750
decided to organize calm actually we all

00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,750
lost a bed

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,770
actually Susie one thing you may not

00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:10,120
know but all of us is that most of us

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:12,100
the front-end developers and I really

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,860
consider myself as more of a Deming user

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,530
than an indefinite developer I'm saying

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,710
this because our group here organizing

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,810
this conference it reflects a lot about

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,850
Debbie and I think not just Deb in the

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:28,060
operating system but they've been the

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:30,340
project that in the community so that

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,320
means I think that should that should be

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,020
something that you should be aware of

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,810
and keep in mind because the project

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:42,310
itself has so much impact outside of

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:44,290
just the developer community it Despard

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,320
us to dedicate significant time and

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:50,229
effort to organize this comp here in our

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:54,250
hometown so really well-done developers

00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:55,630
your own customer please stay with us

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,490

conference featuring a live stream of

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:04,960
myself trying to figure out how this TV

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:06,430
works obviously we couldn't have done we

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,520
couldn't have done this without the

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,250
