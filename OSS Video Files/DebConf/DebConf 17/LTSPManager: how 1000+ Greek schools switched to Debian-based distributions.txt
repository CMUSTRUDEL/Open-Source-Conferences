this is my channel we are teachers from

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,900
Greece and we would like to present the

00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:22,079
success story of more than a thousand

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:27,599
Greek school we created from the windows

00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:33,360
open source software specifically the

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:37,890
tools that we used were the Ubuntu or

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,410
Debian as the operating system we use

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,230
the packets called LTL speed the Linux

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:47,190
terminal server product to network

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,850
appliance we developed the software of

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,850
our own we call it the puppies and the

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:58,050
teacher uses it to monitor student

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,190
screens and another software which we

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,150
initially called

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,030
school screens system and prospective

00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:10,969
users to manage the computer lab and

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:14,369
with the GUI that project is currently

00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:19,069
demonized as part of Italian outreach

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:21,950
project and it will be ending soon and

00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:26,069
we also have to develop some

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:31,530
repositories Verona to host some Greek

00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:35,100
educational software and let's start

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:39,409
with one typical Greek school looks like

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:43,609
and skirts briefs are somewhat small

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:48,060
they have about 50 to 200 students and

00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:50,759
maybe 15 to 30 teachers and there's

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,250
usually one a teacher that doesn't have

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,790
a lot of

00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:58,600
technical skills and he's easily

00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:01,660
maintaining one computer lab the

00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,850
computer that has one server which is

00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:11,020
also used as a teacher workstation and

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:14,140
usually about twelve lines but very

00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:17,110
diverse develop they can be all like

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:21,490
when you three computers or humans like

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:24,310
Intel Core i5 but you service schools

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:28,830
have minimal budget for hardware and

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:34,959
software so that's what we wanted to put

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:39,370
open-source into increase we have three

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,000
levels of IT support for schools at the

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,560
school level

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,780
there's my teacher and whose main

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,790
responsibility is the beach so he can

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,300
only dedicate a couple of hours per week

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,760
to maintain the computer lada and he

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,610
easily doesn't have any linux experience

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,710
so we cannot assume that he can

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,290
use the console he can not only use

00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:06,820
doing programs to administer the scope

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:12,250
computer lab at the prefecture level and

00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:15,220
this do for IT teachers which go to an

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,310
office and serve as sometimes that means

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:22,630
for about two to three hundred schools

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:24,940
and those are more experienced but they

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:29,740
usually don't have any real experience

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:32,800
either and at the national level there's

00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:36,570
a team of about five builders that test

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:40,959
new solutions and recommendations and

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:44,350
best practice guides and schools can

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,300
follow the laws on a voluntary basis and

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,840
the decision is first school there's

00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,420
nothing mandatory and the teachers can

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,570
communicate with the Prefecture or the

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:59,680
national team and using forums or a

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:05,500
helpdesk system or IRC or even B&C

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:09,700
for remote support the first fan

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,630
software that we use and those hosts is

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,180
ltsp

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:17,530
this is the limit developed server

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:20,380
project and which can be used to make

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:23,890
put thing clients in clients are dumb

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,280
terminals without at least that lot of

00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,950
grading system from the network

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,470
server and after looking out

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:34,260
applications run on the server

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:38,010
and the screen is transferred to the

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:42,990
clients like remote disc the protocol

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:45,570
news there is remote x LT speed is a lot

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:50,010
of other software to promise that the

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:53,070
list is to the right and we only had to

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,710
develop a couple of our own software

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:59,669
like a display manager called NPM and

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:02,610
the file system for a remote City CSB

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:09,150
sixth make them remotely available contr

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:10,200
SPFs there are many benefits to using a

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,490
thespian plenums

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:17,040
some of them are listed here for example

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,850
finance airplane hits like we can

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,550
produce all desktop PCs as see clients

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:26,310
so Scott has been in three can use those

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:29,100
and tumbling by an observer and the

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:32,940
gigabit speeds with select five hundred

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,570
years and upgrade the computer lab there

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,500
are no software licenses easy simple and

00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:42,690
it means a less personnel for support

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,610
because we only have to maintain one

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,360
installation only the server

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,600
installation is May

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,210
since the clients are districts and it's

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,130
also is easier to maintain because the

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,730
software is dominant and we can adjust

00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:00,460
the tour needs another benefit is that

00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:03,190
it can coexist with existing witness

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:06,040
installations so if the school has a

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:09,460
windows-based computer lab he can add

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,920
the option to boot LTS be without and

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,080
formatting and client without a to the

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,660
client lists and their teachers can

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,620
select to put 12 ESP for two windows

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:25,000
from the boot manager and think that

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:27,550
doesn't have any viruses so the national

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,450
team heard about all those benefits and

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:36,180
back in 2011 and decided to do a pilot

00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:40,750
and a program they bought 20 servers and

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:45,130
installed a beautiful denim 704 and send

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:47,770
them to 20 schools and one of the

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,600
servers were Prestel it was still

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,360
difficult to get on this be up and

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,170
running because the networking parts

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,500
were rather hard server had two network

00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,370
cards and it needed several sweets for

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,150
the

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:06,310
- solos that ID Beecher had to rewire

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,970
some stuff and to edit some

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:12,639
configuration files for example the

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:16,169
master image was cloned to do sweaty

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,220
servers and network cards were named

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:22,030
differently because of the cloning

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,310
process and was able to fix it so this

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:26,229
pilot program was a complete failure

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,340
the schools were not able to run out the

00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:33,490
SP except for my school I was on this

00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,470
school there and it took me about a

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,210
couple of months to get up this be

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,850
running because I put on a dedicated

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:43,900
about a couple of hours per week to work

00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:48,639
on that so that that first contact was a

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:52,210
failure in the next year I was invited

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,789
to join the national team and the first

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:57,789
task that I thought should be done was

00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:00,430
to write in extensive Giger about how to

00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:03,610
set up the radio system how to install

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:07,139
the DSP and allow a doll and steri

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:10,419
software and how to create user accounts

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,550
but while I think you meant at ulta it

00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:15,190
was still hard because it involved the

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,650
command line in several of the steps and

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:20,500
I didn't think that the other

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,830
architectures would be able to use the

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,320
command line so that's when I developed

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,990
the first version of the software we

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,459
call off school suites which at that

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,020
point where was a whip tail and the face

00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:37,510
and was

00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,089
she's just selected the script around at

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,180
each space chapter of the game

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:47,680
so now I'm supposed to create user

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:51,810
accounts less than discreet it involved

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,810
a lot it evolved

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:58,930
another thing that was missing at that

00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:01,589
time was that we had more than 100

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,600
windows based which gives not apps

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:09,100
increase and we weren't able to use them

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:13,120
in the linux environment and so we had

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:16,839
to create the taken repository which we

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,779
managed with several and we dependence

00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,000
and all those windows applications we

00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:25,930
created death packages from them and put

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,740
them to that repository and we use the

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:33,550
vine or Java or allow us technologists

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:36,210
to make them run other learners and we

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:40,589
needed an additional repository and

00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:44,070
EPA to ship newer versions of some

00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:47,720
software that we needed either ours from

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:50,370
others and that we couldn't backward

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:55,380
search here is the screenshot of how

00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:56,970
they non-education menu look like the

00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,970
school that installed some Greek

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,910
software for language and geography and

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:08,250
math it was everything was integrated

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:11,880
now all the windows applications and the

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:14,490
next year I was invited invited by

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:18,870
Canadian dentistry developer to join the

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:22,140
upstream of this bikini and my first

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:25,950
contribution there the worldwide support

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:29,580
for the proxy TCP protocol that protocol

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:32,490
and simplified and networking a lot we

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:36,450
no longer had to require anything we

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:39,300
didn't have to have two switches several

00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:43,980
only a single Network IP it was more

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:47,670
pleasantly I had support for that ESP

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,800
but I also had to ask other developers

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:52,080
to add support for that like that

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,740
Vienna's mass developer or the IDC or

00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:59,190
the win32 largest developers and I was

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,670
very excited to see and that they made

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:05,550
it work in a matter of days it was an

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:09,660
amazing experience the result of that

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,550
was here six creatures but an existing

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,980
Windows based computer labs

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,420
could just run an application from day

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,600
via win

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,819
excel and get they am a new entry in the

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,000
Windows boot loader to select between

00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:29,550
Windows and boot from the network so it

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,550
would became extremely easy to do mode

00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:37,569
in the next year two of SP developers

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:41,980
Jonathan Carla and Stefan brother works

00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:46,269
here added the first version of plugin

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:48,459
to support clients in LSP now we know

00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:51,100
that they'll be speedy clients are dumb

00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:52,660
terminals that love the operating system

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,420
from the server and then run

00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,930
applications on the server that means

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:01,660
that the server needs be VP and that the

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:05,949
consumer lot of network bandwidth so

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:09,160
gigabit is the minimum and it's like e

00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:11,980
not support for newer clients that would

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,810
be again me this with business and would

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,779
again load the operating system from the

00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:20,009
server but they would run it with their

00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:22,809
own resources in their own CPU and RAM

00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:25,059
and which means that applications run

00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:28,649
properly there was no need for before

00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:31,300
server anymore but the client

00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:34,600
specifications now would be the same as

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,410
normal workstations so they would get on

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,769
ego by the ground and the resistive you

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:44,470
first it would be still be dismissed

00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:47,690
that was idea for our newer school

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,810
computer labs so we

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:53,840
years on supporting that scenario and

00:12:50,810 --> 00:13:01,400
now it's even that proposed at a method

00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:02,720
to install the HP up until 2011 we were

00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,970
using the software called

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,210
I talked to manage the guy in the user

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,970
screen so the teacher was able to see

00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:14,660
their student screens and broadcast

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:19,850
history but that was not really

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:23,540
maintained it was very bad so and we

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:26,660
decided to do another parable we first

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:29,270
developed in Greek only it allowed to

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,330
wake the clients on LAN or lock them out

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:35,210
or sudden down I cut out the teacher to

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:39,230
broadcast history or to monitor the user

00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:42,200
screens or to send messages and later on

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:48,620
and we internationalize it and vagrant

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:51,980
uploaded to tell you in 2011 another

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:54,890
milestone in our story was the

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:58,550
introduction of the think we rather aim

00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:02,030
he'll be asleep by the play in the

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,970
classical case the installation we

00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:06,839
actually have to

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:10,439
they to operating systems one is the

00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:13,319
server and another is the turret that we

00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:17,370
used and as the virtual disk or the

00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:20,370
clients so the teacher had to install

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,379
the software on the server using

00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:25,139
synaptic or some other package manager

00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:27,449
and he wouldn't have to use the turret

00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,550
command to enter that virtual disk for

00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:32,490
the clients and the soleus is the same

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,160
software using the command line which

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:40,019
was peopled and sometimes it was spider

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:42,449
I had an idea to blow the server

00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,490
installation now the teacher would only

00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:47,519
use nothing he wouldn't use the console

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,379
at all and that some point he would run

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,689
a command that would blow the server

00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:55,199
installation and to make the client

00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:58,529
demons out of that of course it would

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,069
open sensitive data like user accounts

00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:03,839
and that's the drawback here that the

00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:06,620
server and the client need to build the

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,170
same architecture so we usually use the

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:18,389
32 bit installations in order to be able

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:22,230
to put all other planets in 2012 we face

00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:26,639
another challenge that the new versions

00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:28,930
of known and unity needed OpenGL to run

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:33,490
and OpenGL doesn't run

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:35,200
the network so all tourism clients were

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,930
in the didn't run available at that

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,620
point another district environment

00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:43,810
called normal aspect was suitable but

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,170
there was no distribution that defaulted

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:49,930
to that desktop environment so we

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,720
actually had to create their own my of

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:56,260
cities and we took the opportunity to

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,930
create three different DVDs one for its

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,570
education level one for primary schools

00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:05,170
with all the scores of the primary

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:07,750
schools etc and those became very

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:13,570
popular we no longer need that because

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:16,870
we ceased to matter at that moment our

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:19,540
solution was very stable and we did have

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:23,500
any serious issues dissolve so we took a

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:26,100
couple of years promoting the national

00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,050
team traveled to about 50 cities and

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,350
educated about 10,000 high teachers

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:37,660
which is about one-third of all Greek ID

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:40,959
teachers the Education Ministry listen

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,600
heard about the solution and it actively

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:48,100
started promoting open source for

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:51,279
example in some laptops 20,000 laptops

00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,699
that they both for students they asked

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,480
they also have a bundle

00:16:53,699 --> 00:17:00,839
Georgia success and they started

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,380
mentioning ltsp and forces generally in

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:09,019
some schoolbooks and at that point I

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:11,760
also joined a local preacher team

00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:13,769
advocated that this be there so the

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,209
result is that in mind and literature

00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:24,209
about 80% of schools use Linux which is

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:38,519
large for seconds putting in we tell us

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:42,539
a careful person I to teacher in public

00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:48,029
schools in Greece how am i sorry about

00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:50,010
artists besides in 2011 I attended a

00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:52,919
workshop in the conference in Greece

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:56,549
where artist and his scene presented me

00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:59,250
at least a solution since my school's

00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:04,049
now was an order to induce 2000 phase

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:07,409
lab with inspired licenses and all 23

00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:11,850
workstations I thought that it was worth

00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:14,820
trying to a solution however I was

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:17,350
worried about technical issues that

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,650
might accompany this

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:22,990
but Alice assured me that he would

00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:26,140
technically support me if I had

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:28,900
reservations problems and that if I

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,480
could change my mind I would return to

00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,450
my previous love configuration without

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,860
any additional effort as no software

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:40,990
would be sold in students workstation

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:45,910
this made me feel confident enough to

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:50,290
experiment so within a day which store

00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:52,210
dentistry and Baptists and school

00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:55,510
scripts in my school ah

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:59,860
and me and my sisters started enjoying

00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:04,170
many benefits motor software without

00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:09,070
crisis problems no viruses similar

00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:12,190
students could get software at all it's

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:15,660
worth saying that my students adjusted

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:20,730
very easily in the new environment so

00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:25,930
the experiment with students succeeded

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:30,060
but what about my products were they we

00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:36,250
need to change the technology use from

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:39,250
2013 to 2016 I also worked as a teacher

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:44,080
trainer in some seminars and the

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:49,720
prefecture I decided to use electricity

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:51,820
learn from the training courses so my

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,780
colleagues had the opportunity to use

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,120
allowed as students and see the benefits

00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,610
of

00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:02,140
they speed about this for extremists

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:06,110
would good supporters in action

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:10,220
the feedback was very positive they were

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:14,980
excited and one of the other products to

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:19,700
implement the LSP solution investment in

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:23,210
2015 I joined the National support

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,700
school support team and I worked from

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:32,300
promoting and documenting that mental

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:37,970
dissolution in Greece what about me and

00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:41,390
Debbie on all three team in 2016 I heard

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,760
about our treaty and thought that it

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:47,470
would be a good idea to participate as

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,270
an intern in an outreach project about

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,820
internationalizing the power of the

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:57,040
Greek solution that was missing from

00:20:52,820 --> 00:21:00,170
DeLeon this for this full screen smoker

00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:04,420
why would the community be interested in

00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:08,000
the script software what does it do

00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:14,120
school scripts has worked a lot since

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:18,050
2000 a and now it is a very viable movie

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,480
based tool this allows the school

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:23,690
administrator to perform all the

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:29,350
necessary tasks without using a terminal

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:32,120
at any point some of its speech

00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:35,510
politically restores for dependencies

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:39,110
and transforms the workstation into an

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:41,270
early December it exposes all of the

00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:44,810
gracious and lt spiritual disk

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:47,600
management in GUI menus it's supposed

00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:52,580
creation mass creation and management of

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:58,100
users and groups it supports a folder to

00:21:52,580 --> 00:22:01,330
the group here you can see a screenshot

00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,490
from the entities be monitored manually

00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:06,560
in the left thing there is a list with

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,560
groups are going to create it

00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:13,700
well in the right thing you can see the

00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:18,020
users that belong in the selected area I

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:21,800
grew a school of administrator can

00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:24,410
massively process these users for

00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:31,520
example remove them from the selected

00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:34,220
group here which is a dialog that the

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,020
school administrator uses in order to

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:40,220
create a student account throughout

00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:45,380
station for student classes specifically

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:50,360
its slash represent a group here we have

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:53,300
six classes from anyone to see - and we

00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,960
need 12 accounts for its class because

00:22:53,300 --> 00:23:00,890
of have 12 workstation workstation

00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:04,640
similar so the Land of Israel fix the

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:08,540
first of phase and then when we press

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,200
the create part of 72 accounts will be

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,200
created

00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:24,260
I tried to give you small taste of the

00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:28,570
LTC monitor features and now I will

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:34,610
focus of some of the steps regarding its

00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:39,350
internalization process did you mind

00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:41,980
that it was Greek software so it had to

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:48,169
be translated to English and then

00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:51,340
localized big in order to translate the

00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:57,580
British dialects from greek to english i

00:23:51,340 --> 00:24:00,289
use the glade soften let's also example

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:03,320
this is the glade environment and

00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:07,309
internet fail you see to dial that

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:12,110
students news for the signup process by

00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:19,370
the right pane you see the way but each

00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:21,740
label is translated this screenshot is

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,510
from the translating environment if not

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,529
part of the day lose for the

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:30,350
localization process specifically as you

00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:33,350
can see using this environment

00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:40,279
appreciated on labels and messages from

00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:43,130
english to make or settle my outreach

00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:47,720
projects project are explained in my

00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:50,120
blog my vendors will upload the DC

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,929
manager to daily experimental within

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,410
hours

00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:54,390
then

00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:59,880
to deal with troubleshooting and

00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:02,880
documentation of course after the end of

00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:06,090
my project I had continued success with

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:10,230
this course I will continue suggesting

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:14,600
improvements reporting issues presenting

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:14,600
the very solution in future Seminoles

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:23,190
now some thoughts about my entreaty

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:27,150
experience what without it experiment

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:29,790
many to me it gave me the opportunity to

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:33,240
get involved with the devil community

00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:38,490
and contribute even though I am NOT the

00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:41,610
next circle coding so I could have

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:45,810
verified our experience and I feel that

00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:48,990
now I have the necessary self-confidence

00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:53,640
to inspire my students and colleagues to

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:55,560
participate in closed communities many

00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,500
things did not be enough places for the

00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:05,700
sponsorship and of costume I have mental

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:09,720
illness and Mayland and is necessary you

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,610
can see a man with sports injuries that

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:18,260
implement reactive speech solution

00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:18,260
computer labs and after any use of this

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,940
[Applause]

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:47,110
yes first of all congratulations on an

00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:49,210
excellent success story it is really

00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,160
really good to see and say that that's

00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,110
wonderful I just have a small question

00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,410
and that is whether it would be feasible

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:58,570
to merge the Deportes supplemental tip

00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:01,840
speed manager services they both appear

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:04,000
to be graphical interfaces and it would

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,740
seem that there might be some kind of

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,070
one-to-one relation that they could be

00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:12,220
merged is it possible initially that

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:15,040
they were both focused and mr. manager

00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:18,340
was on software the school script

00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,800
software but we decided that to split

00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:23,320
them because the system inspector

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:27,970
decision rights while the teacher

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:32,559
doesn't need to do right so we split

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:35,020
them based on the axes if he wants to

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,030
create users and he needs to the right

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,000
stick he won't study configuration files

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:41,050
he needs to do right so those belong to

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,600
a disk manager

00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:46,240
well he just needs to shut down the

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:58,620
clients and broadcast the screen that

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:58,620
belongs to my boss increase

00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:14,000
five so enough film because two similar

00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:21,290
things or is it just about I'm sorry is

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:24,710
some part compared to one yeah there's

00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:27,620
no relation except that definitely uses

00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:31,400
obviously in to implement their own

00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:34,340
solution and we evaluated Scholl

00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,910
innocent again at you at some point but

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,470
they target bigger schools so

00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:42,860
essentially they expect the system

00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:46,340
administrator there and while our rule

00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:49,309
of thumb was that the administrator who

00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,650
couldn't use the command line at all we

00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:53,690
have smaller schools would have a person

00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,760
there that can dedicate a couple of

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,640
hours per week and he cannot use the

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,220
console so we weren't able to use

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,410
commoners because that was vision other

00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,330
than that have many tools that we both

00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:09,040
use and I think maybe they're using a

00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:09,040
focus and that gets me too

00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:21,580
so congratulations - for my sight pile

00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:26,260
this madness madness Brady I wish we

00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:28,240
have a journey so far so seek for the

00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,130
deaf identity that may difference

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,130
actually for the audience to sort of

00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:35,260
sort things is that as understand that

00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,000
is human interests is just creating the

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,010
context account under the machine and

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,130
then you attach machines to that which

00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:46,390
is totally fine for the scale of schools

00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:49,000
so that's classrooms you have a Debian

00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:52,510
everyone the targeting schools already

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,179
Scandinavia and France Germany at least

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:58,809
probably more or less it's more like a

00:29:55,179 --> 00:30:01,630
thousand students to the schools so we

00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:03,279
need to run out of them which is the

00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,429
user management tool then actually the

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,500
tendency in Germany is quite going in

00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,720
the direction of doing the user

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,820
management in the municipality but

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,460
that's also having it also I think for

00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:18,309
students so so that you've run a central

00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,549
idea to the system that's of course also

00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:21,019
based now and then

00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:25,519
all the different systems attached to

00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:28,460
work so it is against the better of you

00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:31,009
States but I my imitation from the Devon

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,559
energy was actually to look at the

00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:36,049
software you have in your repositories

00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:40,909
or that you should with your systems and

00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:42,860
actually maybe better save the the best

00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:45,080
packages so that you can also have those

00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,509
Debian and that there are actually maybe

00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,070
even included in the den and tons of

00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:53,029
parts that we use for creating a

00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:55,700
magnetic packages so so the the ideas

00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:58,340
always be sustainable and to reduce that

00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,279
network so we definitely should sit

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:03,440
together and see where we are asleep

00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:04,820
intersects or a different solutions but

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,129
what the same outcome

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,259
so that's limitation for myself be stay

00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:16,309
in touch or getting the touch closer and

00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:18,850
and do more operational information as

00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,850
well and

00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:27,210
although I don't think better packages

00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,850
would be useful as they all contain

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:35,670
Greek software business in Greek for

00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:38,040
Greece some software's surely can submit

00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:47,670
the packages we can create that involve

00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:57,800
non-greeks hi my name is Fabian live

00:31:47,670 --> 00:32:00,450
here in Montreal Quebec education system

00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:05,370
is basically managed by a political

00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:07,800
structure and even criticizing global

00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:10,680
decisions at the school level may help

00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:14,400
you in trouble in terms of your

00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:18,870
employment environment so it makes it

00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,910
very difficult to escalate any for

00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,530
example the way that you show that you

00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,360
had these workshops where you used

00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,750
ltsp

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,150
teachers interested the mere fact that a

00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:31,670
teacher would show this to someone

00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:34,220
higher up would probably question their

00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:37,760
competence and then get them in trouble

00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:42,170
that's one so two things that I find

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,150
very intriguing one that normally make

00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:47,540
people dismiss this kind of solution

00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:50,960
technically is the inability to run

00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,850
Windows applications and perhaps you're

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,830
very complications are not going to be

00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,750
of much use here in Quebec but I'm very

00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,720
very interested in the method that you

00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:03,950
deuce and it doesn't seem to bleed or a

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:06,650
nice packaging wine with Java and maybe

00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,820
there's legal issues here or I don't

00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,860
know I'm just interested in the

00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,470
technical side of it and I just want you

00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:15,549
to remember it's kind of thinking out of

00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:18,710
a bug that I never really thought about

00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:20,419
we just say this doesn't run here or

00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,400
insist achill to install wine and

00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:24,580
whatever you never occurred to me that

00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,549
we could put together some kind of

00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:31,520
package and never mind repository so

00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:33,890
that's like varied reading to me the

00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:37,580
second thing and maybe a question part

00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:38,950
of my head talk here it is you talked

00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,320
about the International is a

00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:44,769
and so if I understand this correctly

00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:48,159
you had to translate your stuff to

00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:52,090
English and then back to read right and

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:55,470
you use launchpad to do that right does

00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:58,480
that mean that people from outside your

00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:00,730
technical support structure participated

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,009
did the teachers participate parents

00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:05,340
other people or just the technical

00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:05,340
people

00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:19,809
so essentially we set up translations in

00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:23,109
Environmental Management

00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:26,019
Wakita for both deputies and for now for

00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:33,510
Lucas new manager we do our part

00:34:26,019 --> 00:34:38,289
translating localizing back to the

00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:43,899
palace for example translated in 40

00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:47,919
languages right now we monitor without

00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:50,710
being in debt Department released this

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:56,799
already translated in check I don't know

00:34:50,710 --> 00:35:00,990
why I didn't just go there and we

00:34:56,799 --> 00:35:00,990
automatically because the translations

00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:07,569
so there's very low barrier to translate

00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:11,529
it and that was my next question is it

00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:13,329
outside of Greece so if you don't speak

00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:15,850
French yet maybe I can give you some

00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:17,770
French lesson and I can work together

00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,660
and you can just sense I'm having that

00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:22,830
but if they're translated from English

00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:25,660
to French and the next release you have

00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:29,080
thank you very much I would also like to

00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:32,140
mention take the particular podcast to

00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,750
mention an example in South Africa last

00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:39,460
year where they heard about all the

00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:42,430
institutions and while we were lucky in

00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:46,210
Greece in that schools can decide for

00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:50,980
themselves while to put in their Google

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:56,410
Apps we know so - they had the central

00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:58,990
management for that but I don't know

00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:02,970
exactly its title but somewhere below

00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:05,920
the Minister of Education invited us and

00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:09,900
we presented the solution and so they

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:14,280
decided and they were thinking about

00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:17,760
we speak in all that province so maybe

00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,330
you can find some central contact here

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,360
too

00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,580
doesn't have to be her school if that's

00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,940
not how it works

00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:30,300
so Jared is for uh for the record I was

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:33,960
part of the elections to be sitting on a

00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:36,120
school board as a as an elected that

00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,810
person and essentially in Quebec

00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,940
province our taxes paid those salaries

00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:44,750
and there's a very very strong lobbying

00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,860
of a lot of people working actively

00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:49,170
within the sole mission to blog

00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:52,070
pre-human source up right here in Quebec

00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:55,860
province we've had public experience

00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:58,530
construction and health and our marriage

00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,890
Don being indicted and not going to

00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,150
prison

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:04,290
there's a huge issue with corruption and

00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:08,760
honesty there's no way we can compete

00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:12,870
with big companies like Google Microsoft

00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:16,080
and Apple and so the Chromebooks iPads

00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:17,339
and essentially my credit and you if you

00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,779
haven't heard about

00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:23,249
the way to remain receptive captured

00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:28,979
online accounts it's a whole mess it's a

00:37:23,249 --> 00:38:17,999
huge mess here because now there's going

00:37:28,979 --> 00:38:21,450
to be right that's an equation and I'd

00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:23,910
like to point at this point that the

00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:26,390
national team is necessary for the

00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:30,329
support of the public infrastructure

00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:33,569
three to five developers are not support

00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:36,059
thousands of schools but if those three

00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:42,450
to five developers don't work for some

00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:46,640
reason and fracture collapses it would

00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:50,249
be hard to pass I know how for

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,690
deionizing Windows applications or and

00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:54,270
Seneca setting

00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:57,720
infrastructure to other countries that

00:38:54,270 --> 00:39:01,400
have similarities and we would love you

00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,400
to so if we're invited

00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:13,020
one other question have you ever thought

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,240
about actually distributing the disk at

00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,819
night and thick night images across the

00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,450
country so you have couple of separate

00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:23,010
servers and these images don't have to

00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:25,170
be maintained in this school but you're

00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:29,069
actually to hope the sisters together

00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:32,730
and then whenever like 10% invitation

00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:34,380
much reliable image on the other hand

00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:37,440
the contact rest counter question is a

00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:39,480
few problems with Roku images actually

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,030
like that are running in the schools

00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,859
that they have flaws because they have

00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:49,530
not have presented any that all over the

00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:51,839
country so we had some meta packages one

00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,910
before for example is called chief

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:58,140
Nashville which is the high school and

00:39:53,910 --> 00:40:00,480
in school is high school you can they

00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:03,270
can just select random semantics and get

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,970
all their recommended applications now

00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,980
some teacher may decide that wants an

00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:11,369
additional application you just go to

00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,760
snap economic so we cannot we don't want

00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:15,400
to maintain

00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,460
images globally we just provide meta

00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,570
meta packages like collections for all

00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:26,140
the software that is available there

00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:29,260
since a teacher maintains everything

00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,950
from a synoptic or any other package

00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:35,740
manager

00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:39,220
the protects break-ins is similar to the

00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:42,070
brackets we see at almost in simple

00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:49,120
workstation installation which means

00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:52,420
about 1 out of 200 schools I think each

00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:57,220
other may decide to removal an essential

00:40:52,420 --> 00:41:01,180
package and protein which we can easily

00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:04,060
repair with a live CD they can for

00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:07,300
remote support first in IRC and then we

00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:12,120
get control with a Bacchus remote

00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:15,970
support widget that is based in a BNC so

00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:18,910
for a thousand schools we spend maybe

00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:22,930
and now per day for support department

00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:28,050
we don't need a lot of support thank you

00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:28,050
