well thank you everyone my name is Jeff

00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,500
Kaufman I'm an open source attorney for

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,039
Red Hat and we're gonna talk this

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,320
evening about Article V Google and the

00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,119
fair use case which I'm sure most of you

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,400
have heard of we're gonna take a little

00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,589
bit deeper dive into that case and

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,269
explain some of the more interesting

00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:28,269
aspects and the whole things of the case

00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:34,010
when I first start up by talking a

00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:36,920
little bit about my background and

00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,740
you'll understand why back when I was 16

00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,230
years old I wanted to be a pilot and one

00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:45,010
of the things you do when you're when

00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:48,470
aspiring to be a commercial pilot is you

00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:51,050
take instruction to the flight

00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,090
instructor so at 19 years old that

00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,030
became a flight instructor and one of

00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,140
the courses that the Federal Aviation

00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,730
Administration requires you to take if

00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,770
you're not already a teacher like my

00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,530
wife is to take something called

00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,229
fundamentals of instruction they want to

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,670
teach you how to be a teacher and what

00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:11,570
I've learned and remember from that

00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:16,460
course is concepts such as primacy and

00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:20,360
bias and primacy what she essentially

00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,070
learned versus sticks with you and that

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,560
could actually form biases in your

00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,970
thinking and behavior so for example

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,310
when you're learning to fly an airplane

00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,159
you want to learn how to avoid stalling

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,229
the airplane Stalin the airplane causes

00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,720
in many cases the nose to drop rather

00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:37,280
rapidly you get some shaking in sirens

00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,990
your horns going off in the cockpit

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,200
something you generally want to avoid

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,490
and the instinctive reaction that you're

00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,650
taught is when you get into that

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:50,870
condition is to immediately push down on

00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:53,930
the yoke to recover well it turns out

00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,909
that many many years later the FAA had

00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,400
determined that certain types of stalls

00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,229
may require a different form of recovery

00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,330
and there's been a number of accidents

00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,100
as a result of this and it's very

00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,719
difficult for pilots like me who have

00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,470
been training

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,690
in the only way to recognize and behave

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,790
in a different way because of primacy

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,519
and the bias that were formed as a

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,769
result of my early training and the

00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,080
reason I bring this up is something that

00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:22,209
similar happened to me in the legal

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,700
profession I went to Marquette law

00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:28,299
school and became an attorney shortly

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,940
after that and one of the courses that I

00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:32,530
took was on copyright law and in

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,840
copyright law and learned a concept

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:39,250
called fair use and I remember very

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,610
clearly my professor telling us that you

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,890
never want to try to argue fair use in a

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,349
commercial context you're generally

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:50,890
going to lose the deck is stacked

00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:52,329
against you significantly and I don't

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,340
remember a lot of my lectures in law

00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:56,290
school but I do remember that lesson and

00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,950
that stuck with me for a very very long

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,799
time which is why when this case came

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:05,140
where Google was arguing that their use

00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,879
was a fair use which I will describe

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,069
some of the elements of their argument I

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,420
was very biased I said there's there's

00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,030
no way they're going to win this because

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,790
look at the commercial aspects and

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,769
success of the Android platform be

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,500
difficult to argue I would think a fair

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:23,410
use argument and of course I was wrong

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,959
and I really wanted to understand why I

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,639
was rather than why I formed an bias and

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,620
it's been a significant amount of time

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,989
going through this case and that's what

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,049
I want to present you today as the local

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:38,049
my findings and kind of walk you through

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:40,989
the journey that I took with this with

00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:45,130
this case in and the results I do have

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:47,560
to say just for for completeness I am an

00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,950
attorney but I'm not your attorney so if

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,510
you have specific legal questions

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,669
unique issues to yourself or your

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,620
organization I do advise you to seek out

00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:59,019
counsel but I'm providing here today is

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,760
just some general perspective and in

00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,319
terms of questions we can keep it

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,720
somewhat interactive but there's a

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,790
limited amount of time so we may have to

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,650
take some of those questions after the

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,660
talk and if you have the stators late as

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,690
anyone wants answer those questions so

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,190
let's get started by the way I

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,940
appreciate everyone being here so late

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,949
so let's start out with the job of

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,500
background I've given this talk to

00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:26,949
lawyers and technologists and I think

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,479
some of the items here are probably

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:29,830
repetitive or long loads of the

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,289
technology community but let me just

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,419
make sure we level set on this because

00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:36,910
there's some terms that I use in

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:38,889
subsequent slides that if I don't level

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,479
set here they may be confusing at least

00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:44,020
the way I use them or the way the court

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:47,110
use them so you know Java was created in

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,710
the mid 90s by Sun Microsystems which

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,210
was eventually acquired by Oracle and

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,820
this enabled software developers to

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,039
write programs to run on any java

00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,330
virtual machine virtual machine be like

00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,639
a sandbox where you could run that

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,380
program in that virtual machine being a

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,680
program that runs on a specific piece of

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,530
hardware and operating system so the

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,539
idea here is that regardless of the

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,370
underlying computer hardware you can

00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:16,750
write your program once and deploy it

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,819
anyway great solution right so they came

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,650
up with two different types actually

00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,780
there's multiple versions of Java as

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,729
many of you probably know but one of

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,770
them is called Java standard edition

00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:31,360
platform Java SE and that's a technology

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,380
you know targeted more towards computer

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,230
systems

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,660
Desktop laptops and then there's the job

00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:40,330
on micro Edition which is the technology

00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,940
targeted towards embedded systems at

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,500
least it was back in the day and it

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,680
seems like they're targeting that more

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:55,330
towards the internment of things in that

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:58,150
market so Java SC e Java I mean now ap

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,170
is are used in in a wide variety of ways

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:05,200
I think it's a bit an overloaded term so

00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,630
to speak I've had to be very careful in

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,310
my practice when I'm speaking with

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:13,510
clients about what they actually mean by

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,430
an API means multiple thing is the

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,100
multiple people I think we're gonna have

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,740
to do in this presentation is talk about

00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,600
it in the way that the court discussed

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,080
it because that led to the various

00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:29,470
holdings and in communications that they

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,640
have in their documents so API here

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,790
stands for application programming

00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,400
interface and the way the part describes

00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,280
us it's a job that allows Java programs

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,170
to use pre-written programs to build

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,970
certain functions of their own Java apps

00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,340
rather than having to write them

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,320
themselves so the example I often use at

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,630
least with non technology technological

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,880
audiences is you know if you wanted to

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,200
compute the square root right you're not

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,639
going to go to your old math book and

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,680
figure

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,180
to do that in the algorithm for that

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,219
you're gonna just call the math that has

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,719
to RT or whatever the equivalent in is

00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:05,909
Java to do that right so but it's

00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:09,060
defined in this case right the copyright

00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:12,719
dispute in this case involve 37 packages

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,550
of a computer source code and they refer

00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:17,550
to these groups of computer programs

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,310
individually and collectively as the API

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,990
so whatever your idea of what an API is

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,319
this is how important to find it in this

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:30,539
case so I like graphic some kind of a

00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:33,750
visual person so I drew this up and this

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:36,090
describes what we call the structure the

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:40,590
sequences the organization or under US

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:42,960
law SSL is how we previewed that for the

00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,599
organization of this API that was of

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,810
interest in this case and it starts out

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,900
on the left side as in the blue column

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,870
is packages so you have java.awt job and

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,330
uh playing Java dot IO and if you look

00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,129
inside those packages like Java dot lame

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,319
you'll see in the movie classes like

00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:03,599
class white X long class math class

00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,490
number so on and so forth if you look

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,089
inside one of those classes like let's

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:12,080
math you'll see ABS max min you LP and

00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:14,399
every time I give this presentation I

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,509
cannot remember when you what P stands

00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,649
for with you someone in the audience

00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:22,229
does no thank you

00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:24,949
in this presentation like ten times and

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,949
they didn't know it was

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:32,020
awesome thank you so we're I did not use

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
that one of those an example but we're

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,640
gonna look at the method the method the

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,469
max method is an example here but you

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,570
can see as you know abs would be

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,510
absolute value Madson to compute the max

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:47,950
of two values and so on and so forth

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:49,899
so what's interesting here is each of

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:53,860
these packages is a class and in these

00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:56,220
classes divided up into methods in what

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,230
is critically important in this case is

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:04,570
the way that this is structured and

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:07,600
organized this organization of packages

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,330
methods class classes and methods is

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,899
actually copy writable expression or can

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:17,770
be calculated what structure and that

00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:20,800
was really the essence of this case so

00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:24,610
each java method is broken into the two

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,020
components declaring code the method

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,470
declarations and we have the

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,029
implementing code so the method

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,270
declaration identifies the pre-written

00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:37,480
function identify the method body the

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,950
input names another functionality and

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,270
then we have the way that you implement

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:45,790
that fortunate so this is an example of

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:50,920
what I pulled from open JDK what I also

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:53,380
pulled from Android so we have a a

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,930
method you know declaration of a sort we

00:09:53,380 --> 00:10:00,700
have public static long max long a long

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:03,070
being in being a technical audience I'm

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,230
not going to explain all those elements

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:09,339
does anyone want me to take a deeper

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,620
dive into that and it returns a value

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:15,840
right it says if a is greater than or

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:20,520
equal to B then returning a

00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:23,490
I beat and then Android we have a very

00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,670
similar declaration at the top static

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,590
long max long a long B you'll notice the

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,600
implementation is slightly different

00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:35,730
makers just greater than not greater

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:38,040
than or equal so the top non molded

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,320
lines is more method declarations

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,510
defines the name the inputs and the

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,040
outputs the bolded section is the

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:48,840
implementing code as we all know now

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,100
these are slightly different the

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,300
implementing code is slightly different

00:10:50,100 --> 00:11:00,110
but they do have the same result correct

00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:00,110
thank you they do have a sync result no

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,760
but I think the issue is that a and B

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,020
are equal for loans the first one is

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,360
going to return a and the second one's

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,330
gonna return b right but and B are equal

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,850
so we really wouldn't matter okay so the

00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,190
point I'm trying to make is someone in

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:26,160
the Android team created a version of

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,600
this method the implementing code but

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,790
they hid it in a slightly different way

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,220
and I don't know perhaps if you did it

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,990
the second way for Android it runs more

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,700
efficient on a mobile device they may

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,700
use a bus battery power may be runs

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,480
unclear but the point is you can have

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,310
different pieces of emulating code they

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,130
can be written separately while having

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:52,290
the same method declarations and why am

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:55,350
i elaborating on this point because the

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,570
copyright infringement case here was not

00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,779
safe for one item was not about the

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,610
implement

00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:04,360
it was about the method declarations

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:07,300
okay so here was Oracle's complaint they

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,220
had some patent complaints and they also

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,290
had copyright infringement complaints

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,019
I'm not going to talk about the patent

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:17,800
side of this except for the reason about

00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:20,079
why went to a certain Court okay the key

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,179
of this case at least I think the most

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,850
interesting part to all of us is the

00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:27,879
copyright side of this so the copyright

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:30,369
claim consisted of an infringement of

00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,230
such thousand method and declarations of

00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:36,610
6,000 of those declarations we talked

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:38,829
about of the example I show here and the

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,230
structure the sequences the organization

00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:43,059
of all of those declarations the fact

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,670
that they copied those method

00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:47,800
declarations all 6,000 of them they in

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,610
essence copy the structure the sequence

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,619
of the organization and as I talked

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,079
about before

00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:58,899
both the method declarations themselves

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,720
as literal elements may be copyright of

00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:03,040
all protectable expression the structure

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,839
and the sequence in the organization

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,790
will become lawyers called not literal

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:13,779
elements are also protectable under

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:15,069
calculated model so a couple things in

00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:17,529
this case that we're not gonna dispute

00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:20,379
the java language is not copyrightable

00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:22,569
itself google admitted copying almost

00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:26,139
4,000 lines of declaring code from those

00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:28,029
api packages from java SE they admitted

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:31,119
copying almost method declarations in

00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:32,499
essence and the declarant code reflected

00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:35,049
that structure of the sequences the

00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:37,480
organization that is not an astute and

00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:39,220
key google wrote all of their

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,110
implementing code except for one

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,519
function which

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,769
to talk about it was just a small part

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,829
of the case so all that implementing

00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:48,839
code when they wrote a frames right not

00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:53,190
copied from from Java for a long

00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:55,800
immortal Java okay so here's what

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,769
happened in terms of key events 2007

00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:02,250
Google analysis Android 2010 oracle

00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:05,010
acquire son 2012 we have the first jury

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,920
trial the jury found that there was

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:12,320
copyright infringement of the 37 api

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:15,480
packages so the jury said hit calculate

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,990
and the trial court subsequently decided

00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,839
though that what they copy was not

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,579
copyrightable expression so I just said

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,660
almost met the declarations and the

00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,190
structure the sequence of the

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,250
organization could be copyright of all

00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,589
expression but the judge the the court

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,050
said in this case they're not

00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:35,459
copyrightable expression so I don't care

00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,620
what the jury says even though you

00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,240
infringe in it this is not copyrighted

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,390
all to begin with so there could be no

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,990
copyright infringement make sense and

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:48,420
the jury was also asked to look at just

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,540
in case this thing went on appeal

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:55,470
because they knew it would whether if

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:58,140
the did copy it and it was copy runnable

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:00,630
expression with Google's use feel fair

00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:04,380
use and they didn't decide that at the

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:10,110
lower court so at the end of 2012 or in

00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:12,029
a situation where you know Google was

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,500
farmed infringe but they infringed

00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:17,990
something that wasn't capture writable

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,990
so they're off the hook right so then

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,449
there is the an appeal this goes to the

00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:27,600
Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit

00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:30,380
this is a really strange Court in that

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,059
they normally only hear patent cases

00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,369
they don't normally hear copyright

00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,229
the reason they heard this case is

00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:39,869
because there was an element of patent

00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:41,399
prettier so what does this case that

00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:44,009
normally doesn't hear this type of thing

00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,409
they reverse the decision of the first

00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:51,269
trial and they found that the API code

00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:53,519
was copyrightable oh so now Google was

00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:55,289
already found to infringe and now they

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,079
invented something that was right they

00:15:55,289 --> 00:16:00,919
can infringe it as it was copyrighted

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:03,899
okay so now what is Google after arguing

00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:06,509
they have to argue now that their use

00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,009
was up fair use under the law we're

00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:13,009
gonna talk about their fair uses in a

00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:15,359
minute with me so far very confusing

00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:17,279
court history here about what happened

00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,319
and a lot of nuanced issues but this is

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,089
this is I think a good summary of that

00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:40,559
where we're at and there's a question in

00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:42,809
the back yes the juries they were

00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,029
laypeople and in fact both juries were

00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:46,769
different when we go to the jury trial

00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:49,649
in a fair use it was a different journey

00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:51,799
than the first step the first case yes

00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:55,229
these were your neighbors

00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:58,919
yeah no generally not a technical people

00:16:55,229 --> 00:17:01,199
which when I read the jury instructions

00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,459
I think I try to synthesize a lot of the

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,249
court documents and the jury

00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:07,949
instructions and you know it was a very

00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:09,020
involved set of instructions that were

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:11,990
presented

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:15,230
and I actually felt for them that is

00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,000
really very very difficult thing to

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,560
process right I think they'll be

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,720
increasingly difficult he didn't have a

00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:26,450
technical background and they did a very

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:31,970
very difficult job confused he said the

00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:33,320
second trial found the patent case but

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,470
then they were arguing about fair use

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,850
aren't the separate loss yeah completely

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,510
separate thing what I was trying to say

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:44,030
I'm sorry I didn't make that clear is

00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:48,800
because there was a an element as part

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:51,890
of the initial complaint that when when

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,580
this case was appealed it went to the

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:57,080
special court if there was no element it

00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,390
would have went to a different court in

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,970
the Ninth Circuit but because there was

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,190
patent aspects in the original complaint

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,050
from Oracle it ended up being appealed

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,960
to the special court that normally hears

00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:11,420
patent cases and other interesting cases

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,270
in the United States but normally not by

00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,550
itself copyright issues the second court

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:20,390
wasn't considering a patentability of at

00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:22,880
all well there were there was some

00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,590
issues in the case but that's kind of

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,660
beyond the scope of what I wanted to

00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:30,380
discuss but it's because of the patent

00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,840
issue that went to that Court which is

00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:36,400
normally a copyright case and itself

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,400
would not normally go to the CAFC

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:45,440
so in 2016 the second jury trial was

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:48,920
remanded back down there was a the jury

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,140
which was a different jury found that

00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:56,950
Google's use of a copyrighted API code

00:18:51,140 --> 00:19:00,550
was a fairness okay

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,450
now oracle has peeled you so the story

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,060
isn't over

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,800
let's talk about where we're at I think

00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:09,160
there's a common misconception about

00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,780
this case when the community heard that

00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,180
Google was successful in a fair use

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:18,100
argument I think there was an idea that

00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:20,230
API is are not copyrightable okay what

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,200
what happened here is Google successful

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:27,540
argument in the 2016 secondary trial

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:30,550
that Google's uses the API was a Farias

00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:34,150
doesn't change the earlier appellate

00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:37,440
CAFC decision okay that decision still

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:40,210
stands and then Oracle's API code is

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,000
copyrightable expression Oracle's API

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,980
code right in the specific case their

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,880
code was copyright is copyright

00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,270
expression

00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,530
it's just that Google was successful to

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,840
argue that their images so that

00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:59,050
copyright have expression was a fair use

00:19:52,840 --> 00:20:01,150
under the law and the reason I talked

00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,770
before about the CAFC to come and

00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,770
address this other question is that they

00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:10,630
normally don't hear copyright cases and

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:12,970
I think because of this decision at the

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,770
CAF sea level about whether this code is

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:18,780
copyrightable or not they're finding

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:22,170
that it was I think it has limited

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:25,900
precedential value in the court systems

00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:30,070
it would be influential or persuasive in

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:33,220
certain cases but it may not be all that

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,780
significant just due to the nature of

00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,910
the way appeals are handled in the

00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,240
United States that this court's opinion

00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:42,280
just may not be all that significant but

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,490
it certainly will be persuasive and it

00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:48,340
depends on the one circuit that a case

00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,910
similar to this may arise and how it

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,910
would be appealed

00:20:51,960 --> 00:21:00,610
so what I'd like to do now is but all of

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:03,970
you and the dirty of us okay and I'm

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:06,280
gonna present to you in part what the

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:09,340
jury heard in this case about fair use

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,990
so you're in 2016 you're in the fair use

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,160
jury trial the second trial

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:17,410
oh that I should say the third trial

00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:19,240
right after the UK and again what I had

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,280
done before as I try to synthesize a

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,250
number of court documents to try to come

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,980
up with what may have been argument this

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,570
case I at this trial I was not at the

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,770
trial I do know some people that were

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:34,450
there it you know what I could try to do

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,130
the best I could is try to glean and

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,510
understand a little bit from those all

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,970
those documents really what was

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,940
presented and kind of focus on the key

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:45,909
arguments because we only have 20 more

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:49,030
minutes or so but fair use how do you

00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:52,299
argue fair use of your Google okay fair

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:55,179
use there are four statutory factors for

00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:57,640
fair use and there's one non-statutory

00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:59,799
Becker and they talk about all the ways

00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,590
the first one is purpose and character

00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:04,990
of use Nexus before I go there I do have

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,419
to say in the jury instructions they

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,789
were presented all of the law around

00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:12,130
fair use and what all of these elements

00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:15,159
statutory and non-statutory elements

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:17,200
mean how you should interpret them and

00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:19,929
in the context of this case they should

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,640
be interpreted but it's complicated

00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:24,940
and you're gonna find out as we discuss

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,860
this that some factors influence other

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,590
factors and there's kind of this pull

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,380
and push and urging different directions

00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:34,150
depending on one one factor finds and

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:38,980
may put more weight on another factor

00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:40,809
and it's it's a

00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,760
experience I guess you just have to look

00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:45,040
at the whole thing and come up with an

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,169
idea at the end is this is something

00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,110
fair use or not after you evaluate all

00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:53,890
of these factors alright so the first

00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:57,280
one is under purpose and character of

00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:03,730
use is the fact that bad faith ok

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:08,700
doesn't support fair use so you know

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:11,530
there are many people at Google that

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,840
understood at least the declaring code

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,660
and their structure their organization

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,809
of those api's was free use and

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:22,900
reemployment both you know as a basis is

00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:24,280
a matter of developer practice in the

00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,040
availability of independent

00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,960
implementations of the API enhance the

00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,460
popularity of the java language which

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,740
sun was promoting us free for all to use

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,020
and there are people in google that

00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,090
testified that in google's view the

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,070
practice of duplicating declarations

00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,710
existed and that the real competition

00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,900
was on compliment asians right he talked

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,880
about before maybe that way they

00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:55,720
implemented that max function was more

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:58,929
efficient in a mobile device now sun was

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,450
arguing that in oracle now that google

00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:04,299
needed to get to market very quickly in

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:07,360
early on in this case right there was

00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:09,640
discussions between Google and Sun about

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,440
licensing Java and Franklin those

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,480
negotiations

00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,039
broke down so there was these arguments

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,679
that well you know maybe Google worked

00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:21,389
in benefit okay so that's the arguments

00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:23,549
that when a bad faith the second point

00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:28,080
about character purpose and character

00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:29,279
abuse is around commercial purpose so

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,529
this is what I talked about earlier with

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,860
my earlier biased commercial purpose

00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:37,740
waves against fair use that is clearly

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:43,230
but even a wholly commercial use okay

00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:46,279
may still constitute a fair use contrary

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,990
to maybe what I bought out of law school

00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:50,730
so I don't think there was much of an

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,440
argument in this case that the use was

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,169
commercial although there may be some

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,870
disagreement about the extent but

00:24:55,169 --> 00:25:00,440
Google's use Google was argument that

00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:03,360
their use was not entirely commercial

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,419
Google's decision to make an available

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,210
open source and free for all and

00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,919
non-commercial purposes you know general

00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:16,740
interest in sharing software and

00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:19,429
promoting innovation thus the last

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,889
aspect of purpose and character uses

00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:27,750
transformation and transformation

00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:30,899
supports fair use slide but the more

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,509
transformative the work is other factors

00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:36,809
such as the commercialization receipt

00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:38,220
and importance okay so if you're more

00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,559
transformative you have a better

00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:44,059
argument for at various I mean

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,590
successful military assignment so Google

00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:51,090
argued that its work was part of a new

00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:53,399
mobile platform versus desktops and

00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:56,009
laptops and Google combined it with

00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:58,409
brand new methods classes packages

00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:01,330
written by Google for the mobile space

00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:04,060
and they argued that this

00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:06,130
to turn a fresh context giving new

00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:11,830
expression and meaning to the duplicated

00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:13,720
code ie it was transformative in google

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:16,180
or oracle argued that google use the

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,310
depth lines of declaring code at least

00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,650
those portions and their structuring

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:23,260
secrets an organization with no new

00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:26,410
meaning meaning or expression so that's

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:28,000
the way the two arguments went so the

00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,280
key here is that the more transformative

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,320
something is other factors such as

00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:36,850
commercialization will receive an

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,260
importance and really what is

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,120
transformative write the words

00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,740
transformative if it adds something new

00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,740
with further purpose or different

00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:47,470
character altering the first with new

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,600
expression meaning or message you can

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:52,300
get transformation when you change a

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,130
work or you even use the work in a

00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,320
different context of you're taking Java

00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,820
C and now moving that to the mobile

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,910
space it could be an example of

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:06,520
transformation okay so it's going to the

00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:08,590
second factor for fair use various

00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,600
favors functional works versus creative

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:13,350
works okay this is the nature of the

00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,350
copyrighted work

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:38,670
so an Oracle argue here is that the

00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:40,650
process of designing ap is our highly

00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,810
creative and this is the core of

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,330
copyright protection which doesn't the

00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:48,540
favor of fair use and there was some

00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:51,330
testimony from various designers of many

00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:55,670
of the jab AAP is saying that API design

00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:58,350
is an art science and then Google

00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,910
experts were emphasizing the function of

00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,770
all of these declaring lines of code

00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:05,270
they were trying to minimize the

00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,270
creative aspect okay

00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:49,920
the next factor is now it turns out for

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:51,570
example so the amount of company you

00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,640
have to evaluate the amount and

00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,440
substantiality of the partially used in

00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,380
relationship to the copyrighted work as

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,750
a whole relation to java SE and whole

00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,120
self happiness include fair use or safe

00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,650
but certainly goes against it so you see

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,990
how these factors counterpoint against

00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,540
each other and the extent of permissible

00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,880
copying varies with a purpose in the

00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:15,030
character abuse if you only copy it

00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,280
enough to be transformative and then

00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:20,940
this factor doesn't weigh against the

00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,860
accused so if I only copied enough to

00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,760
make it usable for mobile then this

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,690
factor does

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:31,140
wait and then the last factor was the

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:34,590
effect on the market so Google argued

00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,870
and this is probably obvious but if you

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,210
materially impact the marketability or

00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,970
the value of the copyrighted work that

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,100
cuts against an argument for fair use so

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,690
what Google was arguing is that Android

00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,630
making cars any harm to the market for

00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:53,130
java SE which was targeted for desktops

00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:55,590
and laptops not mobile in java any write

00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,810
the micro addition to the extended

00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:59,790
target and mobile device was declining

00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:03,690
in revenue who as predicted by Sun

00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:05,310
before Android was even released so

00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,620
they're arguing that Android had no

00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:10,620
further negative impact on job Hemi and

00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:13,110
that API is our open source under open

00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,810
JDK which is one of the code snippets I

00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:18,450
showed previously under the GPL v2 and

00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:21,570
classpath exemption anyone could have

00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:23,760
copied those api's without any fee of

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,660
course subject to the GPL capital terms

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,190
so how could you bills activity really

00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:33,150
Oracle's market in light of all three of

00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:35,520
those arguments and then there's other

00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,000
factors and this is non-statutory so

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,850
it's not written into the into the code

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,970
you know early code code but the jury

00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:48,240
was instructed to consider any

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:50,280
additional circumstances pro con that in

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,190
their judgment err on the ultimate

00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,170
purpose of the Copyright Act including

00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:57,900
protection of authors and the right of

00:30:55,170 --> 00:31:00,030
fair use namely to promote the progress

00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,850
of science and the useful arts and this

00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:05,310
is why we have long copyright law is to

00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:08,370
promote the progress of science and the

00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:10,350
useful arts so the question is did

00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,360
Android do that did it promote the

00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:16,010
progress of science in these four in

00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:18,470
this chemists way you know non-statutory

00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:20,630
but it is part of the law in the United

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,780
States and it was one of the factors

00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:26,240
that the jury was asked to to use and

00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:30,290
synthesize with all the other factors to

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:36,500
come up with a decision on whether jugos

00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:39,950
used was a fair dues so this is after

00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,540
all of that this was the single piece of

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,730
paper that was presented from the jury

00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:46,730
after the jury instructions and it said

00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:49,250
as Google shown by a preponderance of

00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:51,260
the evidence that its use of Android and

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,780
the declaring lines of the declaring

00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,360
lines of code and their structure their

00:31:53,780 --> 00:32:01,040
sequence their organization from Java to

00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:03,830
Messi constitute a fair use under the

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,230
Copyright Act that's what they were

00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:09,470
asked to analyze and they either had to

00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:11,390
check yes or they had to check no that

00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:18,850
was the only question after all of us

00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:18,850
right so what would you decide

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,669
who would have found in favor of Google

00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:28,320
and by the way there's no right or wrong

00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:29,640
answer you you could have been in the

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:36,440
jury net and different involution

00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:38,940
training so this is for Google okay

00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:48,299
seems more than half I should ask the

00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:50,130
other way about Oracle so we know about

00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,950
this ended up right it was in favor of

00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,390
Google so the parent this position here

00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,190
is that the Court of Appeals of the

00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:59,549
Federal Circuit still at the cessation

00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:02,100
Cell stands that API method declarations

00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:03,929
in their organization the structure of

00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,799
the organization of the type in this

00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:07,529
case right

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,140
our copyrightable expression the lower

00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:13,620
court decision on the fair use right

00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:16,860
does not reverse that higher court

00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:19,679
decision right holding that this API

00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,419
could be counted is copyrightable but I

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,039
think the impact of that ruling is still

00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,440
questionable for the reasons I talked

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:30,720
about and then Oracle has filed an

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:35,090
appeal so that is the case in the

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:37,710
nutshell I hope my my goal here was to

00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:40,289
explain the technical side and the legal

00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,940
side and maybe get rid of some

00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:45,809
misconceptions that were in this case

00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,260
and and I hope all of you found this

00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:48,179
useful

00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,580
I'm happy to take some questions here on

00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,740
the stage or we can do this after the

00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,330
event I really want to thank you for

00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,409
your time and for coming out this

00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,409
evening thank you

00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:11,149
so you mentioned that you thought the

00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,919
Federal Circuit decision would not be

00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:15,290
significant you didn't explain why but

00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:17,720
you did say it was sort of persuasive so

00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:21,980
to the agree this persuasive what would

00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:24,440
be the Avenue to undo the persuasiveness

00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:29,090
or in other words how could the Federal

00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:33,890
Circuit decision to be overturned that's

00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:36,110
a great great question so this case if

00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:39,500
it was normally if it didn't involve

00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,730
patents it would have gone to the one of

00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,970
the appellate courts in the Ninth

00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:47,560
Circuit and then to the extent there

00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:49,820
were other decisions and other circuits

00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,640
there could be a split in those

00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:55,700
decisions and that gets resolved

00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:59,990
ultimately at the Supreme Court so I

00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:02,870
think you know to the extent there's

00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:05,960
other decisions and in other courts

00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:08,210
outside the CAFC and we start to get a

00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,630
split I imagine that could ultimately

00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:16,910
get resolved in the Supreme Court in

00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:19,040
terms of being persuasive right so this

00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,770
goes to what Court would actually be

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,190
bound by this decision

00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:27,470
so the caf seed was bound what was

00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,690
required even though they're not in the

00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:34,910
Ninth Circuit they were required to use

00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:37,220
the Ninth Circuit law and it actually is

00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,470
a bit on the third of me if this went to

00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,140
the Ninth Circuit again a similar case

00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,360
to the nine

00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,540
circuit whether they would be bound by

00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,890
that decision I don't think so but I

00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,960
think it would be highly persuasive

00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:51,600
because that court was supposed to be

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,270
applying Ninth Circuit law now if I went

00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,550
to another circuit it would be less

00:35:54,270 --> 00:36:00,000
persuasive because it was Ninth Circuit

00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:02,820
law not this other circuits law so it is

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,920
kind of an interesting issue but that's

00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:08,160
why I think it may just have some

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,710
limited impact because I think at best

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,410
it's only highly persuasive of the Ninth

00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,690
Circuit and less persuasive than other

00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:18,600
circuits I suppose of a similar case

00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:20,400
when in front of the CAF see again they

00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:35,070
may be bound to that decision that Court

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:37,940
only reasons why this particular the

00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:42,210
copyrightability and fair use of

00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:45,600
interfaces as opposed to and one of the

00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:47,820
things that at least that appears to be

00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,070
related and I'm curious if it actually

00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,960
is related it seems of related to one of

00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,970
the probably the most famous open

00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,790
question in free software licensing

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:59,670
which is that if you write the program

00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,950
the links with the GPL library is the

00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,980
program required to be covered by the L

00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:08,460
seems related to this question of is the

00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,710
interface part of the copyright is this

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,220
an all-wheel ated and I'm curious to

00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,810
clear that up

00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,810
because I know that people some people

00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,190
it's a great question frankly I think

00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,619
that discussion you know has been going

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,510
on for well before I got into open

00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:27,430
source I don't think I could cut it up

00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,950
right here on this stage as a result of

00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:33,510
this case I think the the issue about

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:36,490
what the GPL actually covers you know

00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:39,190
relates to there's some of the text in

00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:42,100
the GPL about what is a program would be

00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,570
look at that you could certainly do some

00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,220
derivative works analysis and some a

00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,690
little use some of those legal tools but

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,070
if you look at the spirit of the GPL you

00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:51,340
know what is up or it's an entire

00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:53,320
program what do they mean for that

00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:56,500
entire program to be subject to GPL

00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:59,230
terms so you know you can't have a

00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:05,369
discussion out here after this I'm not

00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:09,160
gonna be able certainly today I'm sure

00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:12,910
perhaps more clarity on that but that's

00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:17,350
up yeah I think you're talking to me but

00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:22,920
happy to talk about the voice of salt

00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:27,130
you define that a language no me cohort

00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,619
the API is that not the definition of

00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:32,740
what the language is I think whether

00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:35,220
it's a good question when we're talking

00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:38,440
about the language is not copyrightable

00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:41,020
it's you know some of the syntax that's

00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,780
used how you may be multiplying numbers

00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:46,570
together just overall how Java is

00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,880
construct and not be the language

00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:51,190
elements itself but no not necessarily

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,359
the API but it is a little bit squishing

00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:57,310
right about what that means but I think

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,540
when the court was talking about that

00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,140
and we're talking about just a little

00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:03,830
same types of

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,630
itself but not not the API right that

00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:07,940
clearly was carved out as something that

00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:09,950
could be copyrightable expression in

00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:13,040
terms of the method declarations

00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:14,780
themselves and the way almost but the

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:27,590
declarations were organized in that

00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:29,420
taxonomy that I showed this case most

00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,790
life time for me was to here the project

00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,960
I made and an exception I helped write

00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:35,680
and talk about by a federal court

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,680
becomes real

00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:43,550
but the thing that bothered me most was

00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:45,680
this problem with what an AP is I think

00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:48,140
most developers have that to quote

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,410
another US Court thing they know an API

00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:53,240
when they see it but when you start to

00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,800
analyze what's copyrightable what

00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,230
copyrightable components end up in an

00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,400
api I can only find three things that

00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,200
could be gotten right over there's the

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:11,200
implementation which I think it was

00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:13,490
clearly in the case but the

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,350
documentation to the API which clearly

00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:18,080
wasn't framed and then all this left is

00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:19,820
the function signatures and I don't

00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,060
think this is the appeals court when I

00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:25,580
read the decision really explain what

00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:28,630
copyrighted material they felt composed

00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:31,220
API so do you have any opinions about

00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:37,090
what is the copyrightable material that

00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:37,090
is the API in Europe and how does

00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:45,000
yeah great great question I think there

00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:47,210
were a lot of unfortunate issues in this

00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,490
case

00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:53,280
so really I'll talk about what the court

00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,960
discussed and then we take a little

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,160
deeper dive into that either no or

00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,470
afterward so the the piece that was a

00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,570
little more clear and crisp to me in a

00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:06,990
decision the appellate decision anyway

00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:09,380
was the fact that you had a non-literal

00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:12,360
element structure sequence organization

00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:15,270
of that API that was viewed as

00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:18,240
copyrightable expression and the unit as

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:20,130
copyright in this case and that I think

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,380
is something that may have been

00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:26,550
unexpected for people that don't study

00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:28,230
copyright law by trade so I gave you

00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,850
could you pop back to your slide over to

00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:33,800
the definition of non-literal in this

00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,800
context I'm having trouble remembering

00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:46,079
so I think this is probably that okay so

00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:49,079
that's the non-literal

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:54,150
side of it okay so the the fact that

00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:56,309
they copy like 6,000 of these function

00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,439
prototypes method declarations right

00:41:56,309 --> 00:42:02,160
though the fact that they copied all of

00:41:58,439 --> 00:42:04,319
those naturally led to them copying the

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,539
organization because you know it's like

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,920
Java dot laying down mathematics right

00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:10,140
and you start laying all these out you

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,779
start getting this taxonomy and it was

00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:16,699
the way that organization occurred that

00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:19,439
caused us to have non-literal copyright

00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:24,269
protection right attached to this this

00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:26,489
taxonomy but then there's also the the

00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:28,949
method declarations themselves so that

00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:31,380
would be the public static long vamps

00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:35,939
long long bTW okay

00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:38,809
they sadly I think you know this is my

00:42:35,939 --> 00:42:42,449
own opinion that they did attach

00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:44,789
copyright protection perhaps to these

00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:49,229
method declarations themselves these

00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:53,099
really short phrases and as a copyright

00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:56,099
attorney for many many years frankly

00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:59,249
have never given a lot of weight that

00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:01,410
there's you know if there's a copyright

00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:03,479
protection on on just those names those

00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:06,839
function names I mean it's gotta be

00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:09,390
really it's paper-thin right but yet the

00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:12,539
appellate court here seemed to discuss

00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:17,699
the possibility that these things could

00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:20,819
be copyright over themselves and I they

00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:23,219
had some logic behind it I think it was

00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:27,509
it was a little bit confusing and I

00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:28,949
don't think it had a lot of I think it

00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:31,229
just added a lot of confusion to the

00:43:28,949 --> 00:43:33,599
case I think the second part of the SSO

00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:34,490
was a little bit more at least clear my

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,500
mind about

00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:39,530
the clinical arguments were there about

00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:42,200
copyright protection so that's kind of

00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:54,109
the two areas where copyright protection

00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:55,790
attached in the case okay I've been more

00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:57,559
a piece of atomicity that question I'm

00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:00,770
sorry it's just makes it makes me so mad

00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:02,540
because from my perspective the CAFC is

00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,430
used to seeing patent cases so they

00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:07,059
looked at a mixed copyright patent case

00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:10,220
and saw just happens because think about

00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:11,200
api's are an interface to something it's

00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,369
like that gizmo

00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,130
like a replacement fuel pump for your

00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:17,869
car so the interface is the part that

00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,309
fits to the other components in your car

00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:20,660
I mean everybody loves these cars but

00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:26,059
he's actually a renegade some of your

00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:28,280
news one of you I but you know how are

00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:29,660
you supposed to the whole point of a

00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,160
patent is to say okay I've got the

00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,599
machine of this design of this this

00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,369
thing and nobody else can do

00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:37,940
in exchange you know I'm publishing my

00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:41,569
design and in 17 years give or take or

00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:43,490
if I'm a pharmaceutical then everybody

00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:45,319
will be free to use this but with

00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,700
copyright the argument is okay well if

00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:48,829
you can sell come up with something that

00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,609
is just as good as Mickey Mouse just as

00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:54,970
entertaining say common Bugs Bunny then

00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:58,510
you know that's your independent thing

00:44:54,970 --> 00:45:02,240
and there's no relationship between two

00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:04,880
you know and then software point out if

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,059
nobody's ever knows this probably many

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,670
of you have the the BSC's didn't like

00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:12,950
the fact that revine was under full GPL

00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:16,730
and they went and on at least two

00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:19,990
possibly three occasions people who have

00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:21,980
reimplemented the realigning media so

00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,900
you know Martha the question we should

00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,510
ask ourselves

00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,930
legitimate thing to do or not because

00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:31,390
according to the CAS see that was not

00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:33,670
legit because read lines API which has a

00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:37,660
lot more claim to creativity I would

00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:38,829
submit then you know math novice QRT how

00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:45,579
many ways are you going to write that

00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:49,930
furnitures okay fair point but I mean I

00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:51,579
don't think that's more of a thing but

00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,589
is what I'd invite you the same is like

00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:55,630
what's the weakness and what I'm saying

00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:57,990
how would you argue against it just a

00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:03,640
just a couple of brief points about that

00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:05,859
you know although the CAF C is does

00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:10,119
primarily here patent cases and some

00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:11,859
copyright cases I'm not sure if I read

00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:13,630
the opinion that they really conflated

00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:15,819
those to denigrate extent I think they

00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:17,559
didn't try to apply at least with my

00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:20,079
understanding of copyright law

00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:23,559
principles in there I didn't see them

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:28,450
completing those two to me I don't

00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:31,630
remember seeing that the the other thing

00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:34,349
that I would just caution everyone on is

00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:37,900
that this case was very fact-specific

00:46:34,349 --> 00:46:40,660
with what Google did with Java and other

00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,220
examples that you may have like the one

00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,590
you brought up around direct

00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,280
with that you know just be cautious

00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:50,770
about applying those the facts in that

00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:54,210
case the facts in this case there may be

00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:57,520
remarkable differences that you have to

00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:59,770
take into account some of those ones

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,520
think Jeff again for it is very

00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:02,520
