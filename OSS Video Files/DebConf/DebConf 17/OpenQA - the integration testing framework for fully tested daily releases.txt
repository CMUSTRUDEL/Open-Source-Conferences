my name is Amaya both pronunciations are

00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:16,070
things like it's really both latest and

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:20,090
I would like to speak to you about open

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:24,500
QA or to put it in more verbose see how

00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:28,310
you can do a daily we tested the release

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:32,059
of our Linux distribution so first of

00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:34,370
all is Who am I who is this person in

00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:37,370
front of me and I mean I didn't

00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:41,090
developer or some quite some time since

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:43,730
approximately 2001 quite remember in

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:47,140
such a long time over the years like

00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:50,570
making a few packages here there I think

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:54,140
if he had practiced I pass the Ruby on

00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,850
Rails before it became popular I stopped

00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:01,040
maintaining it before it became

00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:06,670
unpopular currently I maintain QT

00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:10,689
creator which is very nice it's like

00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:14,350
the irony Lucy or she was possible and

00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:19,170
also I also maintain is IKEA which is a

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,170
replacement for the current DHCP server

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,220
and correctly for the last year in a

00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,320
little bit I've been working on Susan

00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,259
which would next eight on the green and

00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,750
the presentation and myself we're also

00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:37,800
making some packages things like Lovejoy

00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:41,170
as the stats are what are small things

00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:45,759
but this is also my first dated

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:47,200
conference and it's been a little bit

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,039
eye-opening because there's a very

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,630
diverse product and a lot of people

00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:55,390
coming from a lot of different aspects

00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,490
but not just the developers it's very

00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,819
it's very it's very encouraging about

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:04,119
the community around a view so getting

00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:06,729
back to what has been a QA because we

00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,250
all here there's open QA only this open

00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:12,160
QA that maybe you hear that maybe don't

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:15,489
maybe not even ominous so the best way

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,170
to describe it it's a system under tests

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:20,500
monitoring the framework so sort of

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:25,269
application testing framework it's a

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,820
complete system under test testing

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:31,590
framework it's also a web application

00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,590
it's not something that you

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,720
and the nice thing about it is that it

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:16,630
can run multiple testing scenarios of

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:20,150
the same time using multiple backends

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:25,220
generally what is being used is that it

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:32,600
is using 2 u plus v NZ for executing

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:35,410
tests so this is the most common but

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:40,160
there's also other one has I can use the

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:41,720
idea by directed Hardware tests somebody

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,190
interesting with these things they

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,190
divert or s/390

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:54,000
different button and in graphical form

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,940
this is what you actually looks like the

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,380
green bits is the open commitment and

00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,720
the best way to understand that is if

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,180
you look at it from the bottom up

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,960
approach so looking up the cube we all

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,020
know what you you this is a nice

00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,360
animator right there and two machines

00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:23,540
and the OS supports not which is

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:27,630
probably Indian this runs the actual and

00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:30,330
that's where the open entry comes in the

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,060
green bits the worker each there's one

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:39,180
more girl site well one instance of her

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:46,110
voice and this worker a science specific

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:48,360
test all instances to run tests and the

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,400
worker is done just like the rest of it

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,040
so it needs to be assigned and managed

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,810
by dr. Webber teach Nova publication

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,870
manages the state and with the database

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,120
and it communicates with the worker

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,550
WebSocket REST API and generally it has

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,330
things like the screenshot for use from

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,840
magic you know something like NFS in the

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:15,450
finals and then the user

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:21,150
like monitoring the tester working

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:23,610
correctly or not is is using the open QA

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:26,070
web interfaces so we see all the nice

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,870
things all everything is green and the

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,430
world is nice and you don't have to

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,900
worry about it and when sucker actually

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,090
stops working

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:38,910
that's rather than it's interesting so

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:41,550
why do you like to use open QA it's

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:45,419
because of the quirian has very little

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:49,310
user centric testing model it doesn't

00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:51,510
hoop into any special hooks anywhere is

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,479
literally interacts with the system

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:58,229
under test just like my user would so it

00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,360
looks at the screen and tries to find

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:03,389
stuff on the screen but you of the

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,919
tester find from that would be

00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,570
interesting within the scenario so it

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,430
would be the entire screen many more you

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,580
want to match or just a portion a letter

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:15,479
or whatever it can type on the keyboard

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,160
and it and the mouse and click it so

00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,310
that's the things that it does for you

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,860
to second point it also interacts with

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:25,140
the other system in with a serial

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:29,669
console so those are the four things

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:31,620
that it does and you may want to use

00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:35,460
open beta 2 because it's already being

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,490
used quite extensively and up there so

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:41,610
for example that to the openSUSE it's

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:45,780
run over 1 million tests already and

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:49,530
over the years that's quite a lot the

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,580
test time that you need to spend for

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,360
this

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,800
Judaism almost 25 years you wanted my

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,550
computer clicking the same things with

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,680
25 years it's not very exciting job and

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,199
it actually did fine

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,500
it has fun or maybe prevented or however

00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:11,610
you want to put it approximately or

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:14,219
nearly 1000 months of Mayors so instead

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:20,280
of my user finding something something

00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:26,909
and not a fight with somebody so who

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:29,819
uses the enterprise-c products and

00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:32,780
desktops and the new tasks the container

00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,979
as a service platform all these things

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,360
so that's definitely using about the

00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:40,860
enterprise service it's open source of

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,690
open source of distributions that

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,639
there's two distributions are using it

00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,039
leap is the more traditional

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:53,099
distribution so it is like the

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:56,159
instruction that asana prev cycle is

00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,860
actually tools to enterprises but what

00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:01,710
about this there was no time but the

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,990
interesting myth is summer week tom

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,139
hollie is that they almost take a

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,969
distribution and I say almost vertically

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,620
distribution because otherwise it could

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:13,199
have been a degree distribution where

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,440
there's annuities every day but it is

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,710
not because sometimes of interviewing

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:23,830
will stop it there's been a test that

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:26,400
we need to be prevented so the user

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:29,230
doesn't get a broken system its

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,810
prevented and I'm not talking about just

00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,060
something witchy I mean there is a

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,580
scenario where you were you're doing an

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,990
upgrade an upgrade or a previous version

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,750
the next version and the system doesn't

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:44,020
boot because all of there's a simple

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,930
misses or you're installing things and

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,760
it's and doesn't install it because of

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,010
stops up at the practitioner in your

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,410
openers or something something silly

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,570
like that so this is almost a beta

00:08:53,410 --> 00:09:00,460
distribution because of computer events

00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:03,100
users from having a bad day and who else

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:07,690
is using it welcome about Red Hat is

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:13,810
using it so yes it's it's not just Red

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:15,880
Hat they go to our enemy and whether

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,730
should you be using open trade you're

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:22,930
looking at this opt for using it when

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:25,870
you review using the system whenever you

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:29,020
want to do your tests more than once and

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:34,390
you expect the same results this is

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,680
for example in installed tests and stall

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,330
tests are pretty boring

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,190
you always have to type the same thing

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,700
then you click the same thing to expect

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,800
the same answers and this is not

00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,960
something you want to do because it's

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,810
more in the UI application tests are

00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,670
also possible in with the system desktop

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,840
you install the application inside the

00:09:51,670 --> 00:10:01,240
system under test and then you can do

00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:06,970
everything that user can do the same

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:11,500
thing or you can use screen if you would

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:13,570
feel like either work you should also

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,120
maybe look at open create if you're

00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:19,630
trying to reinvent the same thing but

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:25,210
this is already existing this so thank

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:27,460
you invent us where we don't we do the

00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,660
same thing that already exists elsewhere

00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:35,650
there's a lot of ever done to make this

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:38,140
function so pretty I know it's

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,769
reasonable in being surprising something

00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,449
some

00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:46,889
something like here at the end is meant

00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:50,939
to be easy but it states and then the

00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:53,370
end of the special corner cases and you

00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:55,470
also want to use this because testing is

00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,860
repetitive so we end up with extremely

00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:01,740
high failure rates and I can say failure

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,180
rate in finding something interesting so

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,339
you do something once and you expect the

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,470
result to happen and you do the same way

00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:11,879
and you get the results you expect and

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:14,009
this is very motivating I cannot imagine

00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,990
that were do you motivate a job or you

00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:19,620
do the same thing and yeah I expected

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:21,600
this to happen yet that happened it's

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,600
very boring you just want to find things

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,160
that that are interesting so the things

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,829
that you don't expect how good and

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,930
that's that's when you see the other did

00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:32,490
not what would happen do we're just

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,800
following the script and it's working

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,769
which is the boring words so can it

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,129
actually can it install the antenna can

00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:45,749
we do open cake with bacon offices this

00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:50,129
is selling pinyin I've done this test in

00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:54,029
just a few hours just waiting for

00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:58,350
lieutenant into making specific stuff

00:11:54,029 --> 00:12:02,340
then yes every single interaction

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:05,250
as some assert we're open Cree has too

00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:13,200
much something and click on something or

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:18,990
take something so desktop ending user so

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:23,420
it can test the Damien and this is not

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,420
too informative it is a screenshot of

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,740
console tests where everything is fine

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,810
all that each paper every one of these

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:41,130
green boxes is a street from an it's

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:44,280
green because it passed so for example

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:46,950
how you define a testing of invaders

00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:52,830
there's the first file in the loop or is

00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:58,200
called main dot that's the main profile

00:12:52,830 --> 00:13:01,950
and here you can define a test best way

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,920
just to just to another test

00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:07,470
just use the API here which is you

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,920
suspected for example and the test we're

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,709
loading or loading

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,890
for testing the installation I just had

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:18,519
three separate test Suites like it's 141

00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,110
were installing at 150 into the desktop

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:26,570
cycles one so there's the three files

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:28,820
that you like the final response I think

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:38,240
special and how is this test for example

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:45,500
define for poutine and so every test has

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:47,450
a difficult here and API it's very

00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,570
simple because it only interaction with

00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:53,149
the system under test very small

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:56,959
footprint on the screen type something

00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:59,570
or or moves the Muslim place so in this

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,820
case it looks at this stream and there's

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,490
an ass on the screen that looks closer

00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,769
for 50 seconds if it doesn't find it it

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,570
will fail the test if it finds it

00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:13,329
there's a second it goes the second

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:16,880
mindset when people return that's it and

00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:19,940
for example this is just a quick way of

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,970
hotel you need to find a area of

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,060
interest in that

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:29,980
screeching which equals a needle because

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:35,430
the needle is stuck and the green bit is

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:37,899
the highlight that area I hear words

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:57,310
continuing this is for finding the

00:14:37,899 --> 00:15:00,790
continued and open Q&A thean most open

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:05,100
three dependencies are already in the in

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:08,680
our type searches you think missing and

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,060
the open the action web application

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,509
could be the result

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:17,350
shortly and the nice thing about that

00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:20,139
condom is by accident I then the person

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,629
that actually has been active on these

00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:26,649
dependencies and we decided to

00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:31,629
collaborate on those things so they were

00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:33,630
like like that and and if you would like

00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:37,130
to maybe join us

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:41,400
to package these things make some tests

00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:44,490
reduce the burden on the user or our

00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:47,220
user would be really nice so I guess it

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:50,130
can catch us here at the conference of

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,700
me here today and tomorrow but is

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:58,560
usually spine or email and there are

00:15:53,700 --> 00:16:01,290
some resources I have some things there

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,200
or for source code for all these tests

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,730
or for Vince Vaughn Meghan and if you

00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,490
can recover they're very simple and

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:12,150
because if you look for example said to

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,560
open the Dora fedora open create

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:19,500
instance which is also linked to the

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:23,520
here or add openSUSE s which it happened

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:27,120
also linked here those who can get a

00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:29,970
little complicated various scenarios and

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,190
upgrade paths and great operating

00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:36,410
scenarios for installation and upgrades

00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:42,180
etc etc so just looking at a simple

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:44,750
immunization script from what you just

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,750
suffered you

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:51,190
could be the better way to get started

00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:57,160
with open queuing and I would like to

00:16:51,190 --> 00:17:03,070
also show you something there is I we

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:07,630
run these tests yesterday and the

00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:13,990
interesting bit is is it's big enough I

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:17,620
think the interesting bit is that these

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:21,490
tests they failed with the same eye

00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:23,170
assault and they think up here so you

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:28,120
get the cut this is a pen your screen

00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:32,950
you get your output and then you can see

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:36,070
word like orders as much of against that

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:39,280
does the expected screenshot the area

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:46,030
where it is matching what it what is it

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:49,150
expected to see but it's whoops there's

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:52,420
a virtual device if there's any money so

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:59,440
that's a lot to fail right there we have

00:17:52,420 --> 00:18:05,620
a comparison expected right and that

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:09,970
this just exactly why this happen but we

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:18,130
need to say the device appears it

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:23,200
doesn't I don't know so I think I think

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:25,830
I'm almost out of time if you have

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,630
questions like ass getting water

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:31,880
questions I'm not an expert on OpenGL

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,880
I'm gonna develop artists our basic user

00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:44,420
securement for teasing me with a

00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,600
theoretical of course it'd be

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:50,390
interesting for the dynamics or I'm one

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,540
of the guy with the training not to even

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:57,640
describe wailing too much but that's I

00:18:53,540 --> 00:19:02,180
checked like 2013 you guys were storing

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:06,980
checksums and so on so we couldn't just

00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:10,490
look at me and say which change and why

00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:13,670
how and so on somebody interested in

00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:18,800
seeing this I'm wondering is there a way

00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:22,250
not to do some byte by byte comparison

00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:27,250
is there a way to be explored it does

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,250
not do byte by byte comparisons because

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,870
I just know what it does I know I kind

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,700
of know what it does now and what it

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,550
does not as we see it takes the entire

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:46,250
screenshot the matching area is just I

00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:48,290
think I am probably IMO file you can

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,080
have multiple matching areas also you

00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:53,740
get an exclusion zones so you can have a

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,250
very complex manner if you'd like to and

00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,620
matching

00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,750
I think it reduces the color space and

00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,630
there is a fuzziness you can define on

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,130
it so it's it's it's not quite quite

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,010
person at all anymore

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,900
I just okay perfect and I guess it's it

00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:11,810
might be pretty bold so what could

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,780
exclude the banner I love the tops when

00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:17,330
it gets a baby for the young and ten or

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,570
whatever we can just exclude that part

00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:23,690
and keep doing with this working yes you

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,400
can you can you can either select which

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,190
part of the screen you want to logic and

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,320
you can select which part to exclude in

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:34,040
a match so instead of just having a

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,600
rectangular much areas in that very

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,590
complicated much mirrors where you have

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,180
a rectangle that is matching and inside

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,640
this rectangle again have an exclusion

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,920
zone where you want to have the testing

00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,440
excluded for example what are changes

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,920
that it's not important okay talk to you

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:55,730
soon

00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:58,970
I'm going to get to my call especially

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:01,280
about this retro part it looks like this

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:05,110
replica part maybe interesting scent

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,110
alone regardless of

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:43,750
and the front end is what you see the

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,630
front end is to define a sweet child I

00:21:43,750 --> 00:22:18,120
find imagine areas that's the front and

00:21:46,630 --> 00:22:18,120
the back and I have no idea but maybe

00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:25,750
you could talk to some people that work

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:28,500
on these things there's a person you

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,500
will find it open

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,390
[Music]

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,519
yes sir

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:23,150
if you go to the resources area there's

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:25,610
there's a there's a link to the github

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:28,940
repository or example for openSUSE tests

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:31,039
and it includes openSUSE test for for

00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:37,990
tumbleweed and the notes of the

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:42,470
enterprise it's like github repository I

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:46,460
am assuming haha the same thing but you

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:48,500
get in each of the tests you can also

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:54,409
click on the test and you get a for each

00:23:48,500 --> 00:24:00,049
one of us so for example here if I

00:23:54,409 --> 00:24:02,929
scroll up where the test failed like I

00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:09,610
say installed test if you click on it

00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:09,610
you get you get your source for the test

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:23,410
and it says there's that's where the

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,720
video is generated as any of all the

00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:33,980
installation script like normal step by

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:36,169
step execution and something is mostly

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,650
for different if you wish to have

00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:52,100
different type of testing Suites

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:55,840
different scenarios but yes okay so

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,840
we're gonna lightly thank you for it

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,140
