	00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,420
this is a talk about I Etana indicators

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,230
i Itano indicators is some upstream

00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,550
initiative that I've started and before

00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,110
I actually go into technical details

00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,840
this is going to be a really technical

00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:28,210
talk about indicators I want to show you

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:29,920
what indicators actually are so so the

00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:34,180
indicators concept actually comes from

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,309
the KDE people and they thought we have

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,409
all these we have these zoo

00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:40,659
we have this zoo of applications

00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:42,580
actually dogging into the some sort of a

00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,920
thing that's called system tray and the

00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,049
system tray is well here where people

00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,019
normally find their clock and the

00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:54,010
battery status shutdown button stuff

00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:56,619
like that so and quite a while ago like

00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,360
10 years maybe from now the KDE people

00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:02,110
actually thought maybe maybe let's have

00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,699
a uniform layout for this let's do it so

00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,119
it looks let's do it in a way so it

00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:08,770
looks really really being one thing and

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,750
not being loads of different

00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,490
applications docked to the panel and

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,979
when you click on one of those menus

00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,979
that that drop-down from from the icons

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,859
like I do here with the with the recent

00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:26,259
constant that's in Debian except from

00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:28,450
the gnome desktop it's like one could be

00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:30,789
in gray the other one could be in a dark

00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,649
theme the next one could be with a

00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:34,539
different font so they all look similar

00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:36,390
depending on the implementation of the

00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:39,159
actual tool you are listing there

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,049
depending on what widget toolkit is used

00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,210
what the theming for this widget toolkit

00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,789
is used sometimes you have a matching

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,579
theming between QT applications and GDK

00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:50,499
applications so the KDE people actually

00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:53,259
thought let's have some infrastructure

00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:56,649
in the panel that allows other people's

00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:59,259
to incept the menu information that

00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:01,659
should be rendered but the desktop

00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:04,090
itself or the dependent actually renders

00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:09,299
this this menu and renders all the

00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,299
different like tick boxes sub menus etc

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:18,340
so and then around 2007-2008 something

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:21,400
like that

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,050
initiated by the canonical for Ubuntu to

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,640
actually port this content to GDK

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:30,099
desktop based surfaces so this is a

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,129
Marty desktop and it's based now and GDK

00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:35,590
3 was based on GT k2 formerly it was

00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:39,400
derived from Nome 2 which was also a GDK

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:43,590
based desktop and they started actually

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,590
releasing that I think with Ubuntu 1004

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,069
so they had these nice icons and you can

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,870
also go through that with a mouse hang

00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:55,450
on let's move my mouse pointer outside

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,069
of that so it's really it's really one

00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,170
application actually showing you several

00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:02,860
icons belonging to several applications

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:09,040
and and it's already at the same so it

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:13,030
looks actually really uniform so what

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,890
happened to that it never appeared well

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,510
it's sort of there was some initiative

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,849
in Debian to actually have that appear

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:25,720
you find my notes on gobby

00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:28,900
by the way how many Marta users are here

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:38,910
or desktop users actually desktop so

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:43,450
Marta desktop XFC gnome KDE okay unity

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:51,910
i3 unity unity 7 I suppose okay good

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:54,519
goodbye so um I have some if you if you

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,859
have the gobby if you have the GAVI

00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,299
document open please visit these links I

00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:00,280
won't show all of them here because we

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,099
have 20 minutes for 15 minutes maybe for

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,190
the talk left and I can't show you all

00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:08,769
these examples of how this all happened

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,440
in history but I put all the references

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:14,560
actually on the document and also I

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,979
always for each chapter sort of I have a

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,780
notes section so you can put notes in

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:23,770
there and actually let me know what you

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:27,159
think about this stuff so that is the

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,890
original spec document from the KDE

00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:31,360
world and it's like from 2004-2005 I

00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,300
can't remember really

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,250
so that that that is a technical

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,409
document that shows how it should work

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,509
in three of it was the white paper draft

00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:42,219
and from then on the people started

00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:47,229
actually developing that developing that

00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:49,900
for for plasma which is Katie for so and

00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:54,580
then the I eternal name has been picked

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:57,150
from a project at canonical and it's the

00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,400
IRT more I attend a project on Launchpad

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,009
that actually combines all the different

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,159
efforts by in Ubuntu not by canonical

00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:09,340
but in Ubuntu to bring forth upstream

00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:10,840
software so in your bundle you have one

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,550
initiative actually working on upstream

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,080
code and then the other initiative is

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:19,090
working on downstream packaging but you

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,340
can't really differentiate so because

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,349
it's done in a sorry but it's done in a

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,699
dirty way the split between upstream and

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:27,639
downstream is absolutely not clear

00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,259
anymore so you see patches in the

00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,729
downstream packages that appear in the

00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:32,400
distribution directly that actually

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:34,719
should go in the upstream repos you find

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,789
upstream projects with released our

00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:39,699
walls dating back to years but in the

00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:43,539
distribution there is more recent

00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:49,419
software of that same thing so it's a

00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:52,719
bit of a mess and also so let's go

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:55,360
through the URLs first so for so that's

00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:57,009
this general I Itano team page which is

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,729
quite informative the unity desktop

00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:02,349
unity seven is also part of that then

00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:04,389
there is there are quite some things

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,610
actually that show you wide sketches

00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:10,539
describe the design describe the idea

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:17,650
behind Ubuntu indicate us so that is the

00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:19,000
KDE indicators now in GDK and you may

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,800
you might want to look at that there are

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,819
some screenshots but it's basically what

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,669
you see here in in my little desktop

00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:29,830
example so what is really nice to look

00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,240
at other sketches because there was some

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,009
graphic designer that actually drew

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,779
everything on paper before actually was

00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,810
implemented so they are really really

00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:39,250
nice to look at and and the why I'm

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,740
actually spending time on that which is

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,080
my private time I think the concept is

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,220
great for all deaths of except known

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,530
because genome has it

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,890
and they do it differently now so they

00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,720
had indicators for some time available

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:55,240
but they superseded them by by their own

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,830
concept so that's fine but like for

00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:03,880
desktop like Marte maybe also LX acuity

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:05,620
xfce all these more like for us all the

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,350
people desktop side save but not

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,470
necessarily that is a really cool

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:17,860
concept and of course I'm talking about

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:20,140
the GDK based desktops um okay can we

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,870
have a mic you hello yeah we have a mic

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,320
thank you yeah check your mouse later

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,850
please

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,900
I mean the indicators did grow

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:33,070
additional interface and they are

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:35,440
portable too cute for an q5 and KML but

00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,810
that support is now stalled again but

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:43,180
it's out there so you could you so like

00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:45,160
Alex cute the lxd with cute it can have

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,340
indicators as well for example it's

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,100
their plugin for the panel yes good okay

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,990
so at the very end actually they it also

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,360
comes back on on a couple of libraries

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,260
shared libraries that you have to build

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,700
your panel application against and the

00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:06,250
application that should dock into the

00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:07,930
panel so it's actually all there and and

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,490
that's that's my reason for giving this

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,080
talk i want to sort of bundle the

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,120
efforts and you know bring people

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,030
together and maybe if they're not in the

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,620
room they watched this video and and we

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:23,050
get some feedback later on okay so

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,240
that's the history original target

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,540
genome grown version two then ported to

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:32,469
unity seven based on GD k three and then

00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,510
with what we are seeing now the whole

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,219
thing is about to be abandoned by

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,780
canonical directly so there are

00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:39,460
community groups that continue

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,580
maintenance of the unity seven desktop

00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:45,940
like a good cooperation partner jerry

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:49,900
may be bicker be sure i would say in

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:52,540
german so so he's he's really it's it's

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:56,080
about getting unity seven really to

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:59,760
survive and having it as a non ubuntu

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,760
centric desktop hopefully at the end

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,700
so I already said that canonic is a

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,520
sufficient upstream for Debian quite

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,830
often actually so for example I was

00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,130
actually packing packaging I was I was

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:19,370
doing I took over the lip Debus menu

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,740
package and I said okay what what

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,709
upstream shall I use for that so I don't

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,020
really like you know doing VCS packages

00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:29,690
from bzr because I don't know what

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,850
branch to really use for that etc so I

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,709
said well I want the same version that's

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,540
any what you burn to so I use the table

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:38,029
that I find the UN to ubuntu archives

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,980
pool so which is which is really

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:41,600
suboptimal because then the ubuntu

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,839
maintainer said oh I copy the one that's

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,660
in Debian so so it's actually a circular

00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,279
a thing I can't really tell when there's

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,020
a new option release because I look at

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,360
what is in ubuntu which is the same

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,510
which isn't a bein so it's that was a

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,089
bad idea actually at that point but

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,680
there's no better source except the

00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:03,110
busier by which branch and who's

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,290
maintaining that so yeah so it's it's

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,209
dodgy its dodgy really dodgy so and you

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,920
can also tell all the packages actually

00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:14,060
that are not really optimal for being

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,670
pulled over to Debian because they use

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,380
Debian source format one which means you

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,029
don't actually need an ORAC original

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,180
turbo you can just build the source

00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:25,700
folder with the Debian folder inside and

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,680
you can upload your package so it shows

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,209
that this downstream upstream split is

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,160
not cleared at all at the moment and

00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:35,630
you're going to so yeah you found the

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,570
outer your turbo releases on launch pad

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:40,580
which is really frustrating you don't

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,200
have a you you always have the Debian

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,959
folder in the upstream projects which is

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,490
also unclear then you you actually have

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,230
an upstream repository with a debian

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:52,940
folder inside and debian patches in that

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:54,950
oh wow so why not commit the stuff to

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,260
the option code directly but place

00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,720
patches into debian patches so that's

00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,700
really I mean it was it's actually like

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:08,089
what that girl's all the time I got so

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:12,110
starving to run now um another issue

00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:15,079
actually with upstream projects

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,760
initiated by canonical is on the one

00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:20,390
hand they are great most of them are

00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,360
really worse than at all but some of

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:25,160
them are really hey that's good so

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,760
there's a good concept behind that the

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:32,209
the inner design is done really well the

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,730
the code looks good and then there's a

00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:38,870
strategy change and Ubuntu and it gets

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:41,450
dropped so if you if you build projects

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,649
on top of that you never know if you

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:47,750
actually have to maintain the code

00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:50,769
yourself sometime which is a pity it's I

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,970
mean it's it's good ideas coming up and

00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:56,959
in the past we have seen that several

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:59,000
times also with the unity reader which

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,920
is the login manager in Ubuntu and the

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,720
remote logon capabilities in the greeter

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,870
so you can actually use unity greeter

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,730
and log in to free RDP RDP servers or

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:13,279
citric Service I think that was not

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:17,480
finished that work but the RDP server

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,709
login worked so it was dropped so and I

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,050
know people that actually build up a

00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:29,660
business model on that so which is which

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:33,769
is you know I mean mmm good okay so

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:36,170
there was in Debian there is a pkg ayat

00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:38,630
on a project it's a project on early

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:43,750
Earth and it's the aya Tana developers

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:46,670
in real with real name and they actually

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:50,930
started looking at what is done in

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:54,649
Ubuntu and backporting or porting that

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:57,680
to Debian and so that effort started at

00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:00,380
some time and then it became habit in

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,490
Ubuntu that you actually build upstream

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:07,640
projects that depend on GDK in ubuntu

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:10,040
which has tons of patches and that it

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,570
that these upstream project as you fail

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,339
to build if they are not building

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:17,480
against the GDK 3d library and ubuntu so

00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:20,959
that's not really usable on Debian

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:24,800
either and at that point I guess the

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,420
efforts within Debian came to a halt I'm

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,130
not quite sure

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,840
I spoke to the people who are doing that

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,300
and they said well we are not interested

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,840
anymore so it will be interesting

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,490
actually if there is if there is if

00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,350
there could be actually someone to

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,620
actually pick up his former initiative

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,290
and say okay let's do it differently and

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:50,600
then those ideas and Ubuntu having them

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:56,000
in Debian is actually great so and what

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:59,540
I did I had it started with a customer

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,290
that wanted this remote logon capability

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,860
in unit accretor

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:09,380
but for xtogo service thank you

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:13,160
so I worked on that and the patches

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:15,140
never got upstream because there is an

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,910
upstream yeah at the end there is an

00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,490
upstream there was a time when there was

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:23,120
an upstream and they didn't get upstream

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:25,970
so and and then I said okay if there's

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,770
no upstream that accepts my packages and

00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:31,270
the customer is a good friend of mine

00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:33,590
and he uses that in his business why not

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,160
well let's look at unit accretor how it

00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,730
actually works

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,770
so I actually fought it and fix the

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,420
remote long and stuff in there but I

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,760
didn't have the indicator icons because

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,440
in unity creature you also have these

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,270
icons here they look a bit differently

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,790
and have a bit reduce of a bit of

00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:58,790
reduced functionality but they basically

00:14:49,790 --> 00:15:01,300
do the job yeah yeah so and then I said

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,770
okay well let's get those icons in there

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:07,000
which ended up in me actually

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:09,140
all the lip indicator lip app indicator

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,690
indicator session indicator power

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,330
indicator of blah blah blah and strip

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,880
all the Ubuntu centric code from that so

00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,370
it builds on Debian and it possibly also

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,590
builds on Fedora and on observe if you

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:28,580
want you so Dee Ubuntu nice code that's

00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:31,210
the you're not you're not on please

00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,210
switch your mic on

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:50,990
hello yeah good is all of that in Debian

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,930
now it isn't Debian experimental yes in

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:57,380
experiment so I can just think that -

00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:00,020
boom - no why not because we all need

00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,910
proper uploads and I did some more work

00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,660
upstream and then we need to do proper

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:08,060
packages so one reason for me being here

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,310
is actually asking you is that a good

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,350
idea what I'm actually doing some I mean

00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,450
I'm spending my time on that so is that

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:18,670
something that could be wanted in Debian

00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:23,150
and it will also be on Debian Ubuntu

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:25,430
point of view ideally I would want to

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:28,010
drop the functionality that depends on

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:32,570
the phone in some of the indicators like

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:35,420
the URL dispatcher dependencies yeah

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,220
so I want to remove all of those but I

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,190
want to keep the indicator such that

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:44,090
they do work on the Ubuntu mate' palt

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:47,030
and the Ubuntu XFC port and etc and and

00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:50,240
for that I do need to pull indicators

00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:52,520
from somewhere which do not have URL

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,770
dispatch and all the phone dependencies

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,240
but they're just stock normal indicators

00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:02,720
and ideally I would want to just force

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:07,760
sync ROM Debian because there's no more

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,959
upstream and launch behind so if there's

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,430
something I would take it

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,390
show me your name tag place that we

00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:20,150
consider so what's your name

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:22,130
okay nice to meet you good yeah so the

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,530
basic idea behind behind

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,449
Ayana any great is this actually it's a

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,520
fork and it's actually a namespace for

00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,590
completely so it's not lip indicator

00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,780
anymore it's lip eye Etana indicator and

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,640
actually can install the lip indicator

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,770
and the ayatollah indicator just next to

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,480
each other they don't share any file in

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,240
common and that's actually the goal for

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,850
all sub components that actually belong

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,170
to that so the idea is actually having

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,380
that all in debian making your work in

00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:51,400
debian make and i'll intend to actually

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:55,880
file back reports against all packages

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,970
that that you slip indicator on lip app

00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,669
indicator and switch

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:05,130
/ with a patch - to the ayatollah

00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:06,809
indicators so and and the idea is

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,299
actually that all people interested in

00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:12,690
indicators as well and Ubuntu as well as

00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:14,460
in Debian that they are in fedora and

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,700
whereas it might spread that they

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,710
actually come together in the upstream

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,690
world of ayatollah indicators and that

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,940
they actually justified pull requests on

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,919
get up in the upstream code and that we

00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,419
do regular releases pull them into

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,590
Debbie and pull them into fedora and

00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,280
then have them you know nearly

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,159
everywhere

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,860
so that is the basic idea that I have

00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:38,340
and the reason for giving this talk is I

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,480
don't want to do it alone so I think I

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,780
found someone who's interested in

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,880
joining in if there are more out there

00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,370
I'd be really happy to actually see you

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:54,000
and talk to you and receive mail from

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:57,059
you so so to get in touch actually so

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,070
source code is won't get up and it's

00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:02,039
currently under the realm or the

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,980
organization roof of the arctica project

00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:07,650
which might be not optimal so I'm very

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,020
open to actually opening up an ayat on a

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,110
project or on it well whatever the name

00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,460
is and and collect the stuff there so it

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,960
doesn't have to be under that it's just

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,390
it was an infrastructure we already had

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,640
and we have nightly Birds of the code

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,039
already so it might also be just a good

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,840
idea to leave it there because because

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,640
some workflows are already implemented

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,850
and it would be quite a bunch of work to

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:35,370
actually move that away to and migrate

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:37,590
it to some other namespace so and the

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,780
the status quo actually is that all

00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:44,250
indicator related libraries no work on

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:46,830
non Ubuntu systems and I have ported the

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,929
journey generic application indicator

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:53,340
which allows third-party applications to

00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:55,440
dock into the indicator area okay and

00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,870
there is still some summer work to do

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,760
and basically you can contact me as son
