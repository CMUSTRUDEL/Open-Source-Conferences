all right so hi everybody thanks for

00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,700
coming so my name is Vicenta and I work

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,220
for the Maria DB foundation I am a

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,619
software engineer and today I'm going to

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,599
talk to you about Mary DB and why this

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:30,599
is important for Debian given the recent

00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:32,610
announcement of stretch so first of all

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,510
have any of you heard of Maria to be

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,510
before yeah

00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:49,699
okay so have any of you heard of Murray

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:55,110
DB before okay

00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:57,780
quite a few people actually well for

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,329
those of you who haven't Murray DB is a

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,960
fork of my skill and I assume people

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,080
have heard of MySQL now why does Murray

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,040
DB exist so our first release happened

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,530
in a in around 2009 and Murray DB was

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,200
created as a response to Oracle

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,660
acquiring MySQL it was uncertain back

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,860
then what what would the future of MySQL

00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:25,520
and thus Murray DB was born ready was

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,679
started by the original authors of MySQL

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:33,690
including Michael Monteverde Gnaeus and

00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:36,509
now has its development guided by the

00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,429
more EDP foundation the Murray DB

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:43,200
foundation owns the copyright for the

00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:45,149
Murray DB server and this is made to

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,500
ensure that there will always be a

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:52,349
marietv server as I've said our first

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:57,479
release was in October 2009 with Murray

00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:59,700
DB 5 1 and this is when Murray DB has

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,670
introduced quite a few extra features

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:09,179
which were not available in MySQL at the

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:11,400
time and throughout the years we've

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,310
finally managed to get ourselves as the

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,470
default Mary DB variant MySQL variant in

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:22,470
Debian so this is an important step and

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:26,099
if some of you haven't read the release

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,110
notes this will probably come as a

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,379
surprise and maybe there are questions

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,560
about compatibility how is this going to

00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:36,720
affect me I am able to answer most of

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,849
these questions so if you have any feel

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,800
free to interrupt me I have there is

00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:42,800
plenty of time for questions as well so

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,940
first of all I'm just going to go

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,030
through a brief history and rundown of

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,519
everything that's happened so the Murray

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,100
foundation was created to ensure that

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,370
Murray DB server always exists

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:03,390
open-source software our goal is to

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,790
foster collaboration to be the point

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,700
where people want go through in order to

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,060
collaborate on the my DV server we also

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,830
aim to increase adoption and basically

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,030
promote more ADB wherever possible

00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:23,760
currently we are a staff of eight people

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:26,370
so not a lot of manpower we mainly deal

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,090
with porting and packaging more ADB for

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:34,500
various linux distributions we do do

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:38,400
some code review and write some patches

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:41,760
but most of the development resources

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,820
come from the marae DB corporation the

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,050
Murray degree corporation is one of one

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,350
of the sponsors for the malady

00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:52,620
foundation but it is not the main one so

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,690
most of the development actually comes

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,790
through the eyes of the community

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,850
so whatever the community thinks that is

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,150
it is correct this is what the emerging

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:08,150
foundation and now analyzes and this is

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,150
how we decide where to take the server

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,310
most of the sponsors are corporations so

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,640
the biggest one the biggest user for us

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,600
is actually booking.com

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,170
they are using Murray to be in

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,600
production basically their whole

00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,510
back-end runs on Murray DB there are

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,300
MySQL and instances as well but it's a

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:35,030
very good example of a use case that

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,030
works in a very profitable organization

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,190
other recent sponsors include Alibaba

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,660
which is basically the Amazon of China

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:51,600
and also Tencent cloud which is again a

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:54,660
Chinese company so where does my TV

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,940
stand right now compared to MySQL well

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,280
everybody knows MySQL it's probably it's

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:04,110
been around for quite some time if we

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,270
compare the popularity of MySQL compared

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,790
to Murray DB you can see that match my

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,210
skill is way up here while small DB is

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,590
slowly growing

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,580
but it is actually the fastest growing

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:22,340
database in popularity as of I think

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:25,670
April 2017 we are used and supported

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:29,180
officially in multiple platforms such as

00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:33,220
WordPress Wikipedia uses my hamare DB as

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:36,830
a back-end so these are some of the

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:41,270
companies which make use of the Mora DB

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:43,430
server let's look at how we actually

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,260
interact with the community so a lot of

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,540
our development comes from contributions

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:53,420
from the outside from the outside world

00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,960
look so looking at 2016 we had about 140

00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:59,000
pull requests which we reviewed and

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,060
about 80% of them got merged into the

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,940
server if we look at this here it's only

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,980
been half the time but we've gotten the

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,140
same number of pull requests so we're

00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,950
basically doubling our contributions

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:15,080
year a year over year which is one of

00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:18,400
our main goals and we I think we are

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,080
succeeding in that regard what I hope to

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,870
also leave you from this presentation is

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,750
with a few ideas on how to contribute to

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,850
Murray DB as a project but also to other

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,970
open source projects and perhaps how you

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:37,010
can make use of our ideas in your open

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:40,580
source project if you look at the graph

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,290
we can see that when a DB has had the

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,760
first two lines are more a DB the other

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,910
two are Oracle

00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,650
one is for 2016 whereas one is for 2017

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,430
we can see that the number of

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:54,230
contributions from the community are

00:06:51,430 --> 00:07:00,710
increasing way faster than or the way

00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:03,800
Oracle does things and here's what we

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:07,370
achieved through these contributions so

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,980
first we've managed to get married EB 10

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,230
won in Debian we actually aimed to get

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,980
10 to instead of 10 one being more

00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:19,160
feature-rich but unfortunately we just

00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:22,070
didn't have the enough manpower to fix

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,919
all the bugs which we had intend to by

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:27,470
the time we had to

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:30,099
however we did release a stable version

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:34,520
of ten - which includes a lot of

00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:39,639
important features so we have advanced

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,639
querying features half of these were

00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:46,360
contributed by a student working on for

00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,360
about three months

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,830
then we managed to get my rocks perform

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:55,270
a highly performant storage engine

00:07:51,830 --> 00:08:00,979
developed by Facebook that aims to

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:03,919
reduce the space use on hard drives this

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:06,139
is mostly aimed for SSDs while still

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,800
maintaining performance comparable to

00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:11,360
the main storage engine which is in ODB

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,539
and we've had a contribution from

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,389
Alibaba a flashback plug-in which allows

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:22,069
you to return your data base to a point

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:23,719
in time previous to when say disaster

00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:27,289
happened and you deleted all the rows in

00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:31,520
the database and we also managed to get

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:34,310
10 3 as a first alpha release 10 free

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,409
focuses on compatibility I have a talk

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,240
about all of the 10 free features which

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,640
are planned so if you're interested

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,820
tomorrow I'm going to present everything

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,399
that ten free has and try not to get

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,800
this talk to be too technical this is

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:53,390
mainly about contributions from the

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:57,769
community so how do we interact with the

00:08:53,390 --> 00:09:01,730
community well from the start from when

00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:05,600
MySQL was initially created our goal was

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:08,959
to be as responsive to leaking to any

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,019
question from the outside to give as

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,600
many as much help as possible so and

00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:19,550
we've tried to maintain this in the

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:22,760
murid we approached things so we are

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:25,040
very responsive on mailing lists if you

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,279
ask any question on mario TBH developers

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,850
you will get an answer if not in hours

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:34,040
at most a day you will get an answer you

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,430
can find us on IRC on murray DB at free

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,760
node

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:42,510
and if you do submit a pull request for

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,550
us even if it's a poor one we are more

00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:48,779
than happy to give you feedback on it

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:51,150
and give you time even even teach you

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:55,080
how to write a correct patch so that it

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:57,660
does get accepted into the server so the

00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,850
main thing here to take is that whenever

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,000
you try to interact or interact with us

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,670
you get an interaction from a human

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,750
being not just a canned response which

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:14,150
unfortunately is part of the way Oracle

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:19,230
does things right now so we've tried to

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:20,640
steer away from such an approach here's

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,190
an example of a pull request this is

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,990
actually reviewed by me so groover Dan

00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,890
is one of our main community

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,650
contributors he I think submits about

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,880
40% of the pull requests each year

00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:36,180
they're not necessarily big

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,720
contributions but he does use Murray DB

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,610
where where he works and he provides

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,959
fixes here and there whatever he finds a

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:48,089
problem and here's an example he we I

00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:50,100
think for his contribution I also had a

00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,690
chance to review it before giving him

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,120
the reply and I gave him the reply

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,620
immediately unfortunately this

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,110
particular pull request is not yet

00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,589
merged we've had a long discussion along

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:06,180
around it but discussions do happen and

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:08,630
we take all the input so I I think this

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:15,839
is one of the many reasons why people do

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:18,959
send us pull requests now if you want to

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,660
contribute we do take for requests

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,839
obviously through github but you can

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,760
also contribute on our documentation our

00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,209
documentation is in the form of a wiki

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:33,450
it's called a knowledgebase and you can

00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:35,700
edit it it's it's free for everyone

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,770
we have not had problems with

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:42,600
vandalizing so the documentation is

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:44,310
pretty much correct what we did we do

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,889
still curate all contributions to make

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:51,699
sure that they are not wrong or missing

00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:54,519
elements now if you want to contribute

00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:58,269
from a technical standpoint say a code

00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:00,939
patch for new time contributors you need

00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:04,779
to be patient the code is very old it's

00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:06,910
been inherited from MySQL but any

00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:10,720
questions you have we are more than

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:14,109
happy to answer them we actually take a

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,739
lot of first-time contributors which are

00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,720
students

00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:18,069
so people who have had no software

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,029
development experience outside

00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:24,730
University and we managed to work with

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:25,089
them to get important features out the

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,309
door

00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:31,089
I for one actually started working for

00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:35,529
ADB as a student I did one of the key

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:37,410
features way back in 2013 so if you've

00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:40,689
heard of roles in the sequel standard

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:43,509
this is what Mirae DB supports and MySQL

00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:46,600
still does not support as a stable

00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:52,389
feature they've managed to now almost

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:54,040
implement it we do have open bugs but

00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:58,569
most of the open bugs are not really

00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:01,449
trivial so if you find any which you

00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,279
seem you find interesting do ask us you

00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:07,689
may bite off more than you can chew for

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:10,029
the first contribution so one of the

00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:12,730
projects which we proposed for google

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:15,220
Summer of Code we tried to make them as

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,290
self-contained as possible so that you

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,829
can actually get to work and be

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:23,519
productive here are a few examples such

00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:25,779
as extending the authentication back-end

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,910
this was something which we try to do

00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:29,799
this summer however we did not get a

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,730
chance to finish it so it's still

00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:37,179
available and the other ones are also

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:39,249
pretty good I starter projects so if you

00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:41,980
know anyone or if you are interested in

00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:45,009
contributing do ask us about these ask

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:49,029
me right now if you want I know a few

00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:51,579
details about them now one thing to note

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:53,859
and this may be something that some may

00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:56,230
have questions about we require all our

00:13:53,859 --> 00:14:00,129
contributions to be unsubmitted under

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:02,110
the adb contributor agreement or the bsd

00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:04,449
free license

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,480
the key thing here is that the Murray DB

00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:11,800
needs and the Moody foundation needs to

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:14,679
have copyright over the code one of the

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:18,399
main reasons for this is that we need to

00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:20,740
be able to maintain a GPL compatible

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:25,059
license and do not want to fall into the

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:27,339
trap that open SSL has with the

00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:32,829
licensing problems so I can go into more

00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:34,329
details on this if you're interested now

00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,480
if you want to contribute from a non

00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,939
technical standpoint you are more than

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,009
welcome to help us and we have a lot of

00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:44,800
knowledge based pages which are only in

00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:47,439
English translating them would be a real

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,619
help with we I don't think we have any

00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:54,939
French documentation right now so French

00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:57,009
is more than welcome the way MySQL used

00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:58,839
to work in development before was that

00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:01,269
all its features would be tested by the

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:05,019
community so the more people we have

00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:06,910
testing our upcoming features the faster

00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:09,339
we can get our stable release out

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,850
because that's why you find bugs earlier

00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:15,549
and can fix them faster so please try

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,019
out any alpha or beta release don't do

00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:19,779
it in production that's obviously not a

00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:22,629
good idea but please try out new

00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:24,999
releases and let us know of any bugs you

00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:27,809
find I guarantee you that any bug that

00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:31,420
you report will be looked at and

00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:33,160
investigated we do not shove bugs away

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,869
is just that since we are not too many

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,470
people we it may take a while for it to

00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:37,470
be fixed

00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:45,550
we also hold bi annual conferences so

00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,760
these are developer conference much like

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:50,380
depth conf they are free to attend and

00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,330
during these developer conferences we

00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:56,320
actually plan our next steps

00:15:52,330 --> 00:16:00,430
our next features and if anyone wants to

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,430
get involved into this you can come it's

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,930
you're more than welcome to we do

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,070
announce it this one has been announced

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,410
I think a week ago

00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:13,750
our next developer meeting is in China

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:16,000
it's been it's in Shenzhen City so if

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:21,730
you want to come over there

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,770
come meet meet with us now that's that's

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,290
all for the slides that I have I hope

00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:30,040
that you actually have more questions

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:32,650
for me because I kind of prepared for a

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,260
debate especially about how Murray DB is

00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:42,610
now the default in Debian and basically

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:56,740
replaces MySQL implicitly okay so thank

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:59,130
you right any questions sure I can

00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,130
repeat the question

00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:15,509
okay

00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:17,039
okay so the question is what is the

00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:19,949
status of merida be in other

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,220
distributions not just debian for

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:26,610
example in ubuntu well we have had one

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,879
email from an Ubuntu developer in about

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,259
in 2014 which which seemed quite

00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:35,879
promising that they are considering

00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:37,649
mariadb we are strongly focusing on

00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:40,799
getting more EDB default in ubuntu as

00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:44,220
well so this is one of our next steps we

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,769
are we're aiming to get into bloom to

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,440
other distributions such as Arch Linux

00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:51,629
actually adopted Murray to be quite a

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:57,720
while ago and if you were to install

00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:59,850
MySQL then you would get married EB I am

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:04,860
NOT certain about fedoras their status

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:07,139
right now I know we produce packages for

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:11,279
fedora and I'm actually one of the

00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:12,539
persons involved in making sure that

00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,049
there are no bugs in all the

00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:18,570
architectures that all the distributions

00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:22,039
support so the ten ten main ones in

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:28,559
Debian and I think there's power8 on

00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:32,720
fedora still so we try to be as friendly

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,720
as possible with distributions

00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,250
so one of the things that does come up

00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:46,030
especially in database related

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:49,720
conferences is the compatibility between

00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:53,860
MySQL and MariaDB so say you had an

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:56,950
application which was using MySQL let's

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,510
say WordPress for example until recently

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:02,860
they did not mention Murray DB as

00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:05,670
supported previously we claimed that

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,830
Murray DB was a drop-in replacement

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:12,190
obviously as time went on starting with

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:15,070
version 5 5 we've actually changed the

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,950
labeling the version numbering to differ

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,200
from Oracle's Mya scale so we 5 5 was

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:23,290
the same for both Murray DB and my skill

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:28,110
but then my Murray did we had 10 zero or

00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:32,740
achill continued within 5 6 10 10 1 5 7

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:34,840
etc so most of the features which a

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:38,100
regular application would use will

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,800
probably work both for more ADB and

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,570
MySQL no problem the problem comes when

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:48,580
you're trying to use advanced features

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:51,550
such as replication and not regular

00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,490
replication but replication that uses

00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:57,010
global transaction IDs this is a feature

00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:59,320
that started in 10 0 so it's the first

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:03,490
feature which differs entirely in

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,920
implementation from MySQL we have tried

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,250
to make Murray DB behave as nicely as

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:12,429
possible with Oracle's MySQL so if you

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:16,270
give Murray DB the data directory from

00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:21,420
MySQL it will load it it will do its

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:23,500
best to behave as if it were my SQL

00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,510
there are there obviously differences

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,690
which we did not agree with Oracle and

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,760
we change those but most of the features

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,520
should work and we're trying our best

00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,230
given how little information Oracle

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,580
gives us to maintain as much

00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,580
compatibility as possible

00:20:43,300 --> 00:21:17,300
I can repeat the question if it's okay

00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:20,450
so the usual way that we treat this is

00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:24,730
we have switches which enable or disable

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:27,730
such behavior for example 10 3 actually

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,720
starts implementing oracle style syntax

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:32,750
which is not something that's always

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,390
only person compatible with MySQL syntax

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:38,840
and there's a switch which enables or

00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,880
disables this sort of behavior and if

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,160
there is such a concern for example with

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,840
the in with the integers there will

00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,990
probably be a switch for this case as

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,990
well

00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,559
all right thank you for your

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:02,260
presentation you said there is no French

00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:05,020
documentation which is I think what you

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,240
said you have so to the best of my

00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,610
knowledge I do not know of any pages

00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,850
written in French if there are then I

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,920
know they're not a lot of them okay so

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,070
maybe I can help you with that so if I

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:21,429
want to help you to translate or how can

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:24,460
I help you with them the best way to do

00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:26,140
it is to just create an article maybe

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,620
add the same title as the one in English

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,929
but in French and just ping us on IRC

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:35,470
the Murray DB discuss my TV developers

00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:37,929
mailing list generally if you add it to

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,850
the knowledgebase this is a wiki it's

00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:43,860
just gonna be there and you'll get all

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,860
the credit for it okay thank you

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,650
one thing to notice that I'm not very

00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,510
knowledgeable about how the licensing

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:56,590
works for the knowledge base it should

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:58,420
be Creative Commons but don't take my

00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,980
word for it you should read the license

00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:04,840
agreement before beforehand to make sure

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:07,330
that you agree with it so I have one

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,000
question you mentioned licenses so what

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:12,520
is the situation with the licenses of

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,640
maria de beavers my secret and so on

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:18,070
because as far as I remember for my

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:21,400
sequel times there was this dual

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:24,809
licensing commercial for company and GPL

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:29,020
now after fork I assumed this was GPL

00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:31,600
but you mentioned this Maria DB

00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:34,380
contributor agreement and BSD license so

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,740
what's there right now

00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:43,030
okay so historically there was this dual

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:46,030
licensing thing this was obviously to

00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:50,590
enable to the mysql to continue

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:53,140
development it was for-profit this

00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:56,950
cannot happen with more ADB because my

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:59,650
adb does not own the copyright on the

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:02,260
part of the server which existed before

00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:05,200
the fork happened so all that a code

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:08,140
belongs to Oracle RightNow that code is

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,299
now GPL version 2 licensed

00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,610
the problem is that Oracle can change at

00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:15,899
any time the license for that the code

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:18,309
that they own to anything they want and

00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:20,500
what we do is we try to maintain

00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:25,029
compatibility by fetching patches from

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:26,769
Oracle porting them into Amara DB it's

00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:28,830
not the one-to-one match but we take

00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:35,470
their patches and merge them into my DB

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:38,080
if so this is all file they they remain

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:41,500
under the GPL version to license however

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:46,600
if a contributor comes in and submits

00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:48,460
their work under GPL version two it's

00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,159
still fine all the code is still free

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,080
but if Oracle then decides to change it

00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:57,130
to something incompatible with GPL

00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:59,799
version two for example GPL version 3 we

00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:02,649
would be unable to fetch any more

00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:04,630
patches from them if we are not able to

00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:07,750
change the license to GPL version 3

00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:10,529
ourselves so we would be stuck with the

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:13,210
GPL version 2 version of the code and

00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:16,029
are unable to merge GPL version 3

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:19,389
patches from Oracle anymore in order to

00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:21,250
change the license if we need to ask

00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:23,529
permission to all the contributors who

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:28,000
have contributed their code to be able

00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:30,340
to change it to GPL version 3 and in in

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,200
this case it just creates a potential

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,269
extra barrier which is why we are

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,799
accepting contributions other BSD

00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:41,559
version 3 or under the MCA agreement so

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:46,059
if I understand correctly BSD allows you

00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:48,130
to realize since two GPL or BSD is free

00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:53,590
enough to not have this potential

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:57,220
problem so either to have MCA

00:25:53,590 --> 00:26:01,149
to allo for licensing virus MariaDB

00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:03,639
Foundation or have BSD which is free so

00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:07,240
it can be merged with GPL or any other

00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:08,889
okay this is the general idea I'm not a

00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,820
lawyer I cannot tell you the fine points

00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:15,149
but this is the main idea okay so can

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,830
you elaborate a little bit on the

00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:18,460
relationship between MariaDB Foundation

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,889
and calm

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,690
because those are they completely

00:26:20,889 --> 00:26:27,129
separate yes so there was the slide that

00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:31,419
sponsors here so there is the marady

00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:38,649
beef corporation logo here right there

00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:40,899
so that's my DB Corporation logo so the

00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:42,580
main financial sponsors for the for the

00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:46,119
foundation are booking.com

00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:47,320
Alibaba and Tencent I think around April

00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:49,960
there was an announcement that the

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,659
corporation provides that at most one

00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:57,070
sixth of the funding for the Model T V

00:26:52,659 --> 00:27:01,690
Foundation so in the sense of financial

00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:05,519
incentives the corporation does not

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:07,659
control the foundation what the

00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,309
corporation does however is provide us

00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:13,480
with a lot of development resources

00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:16,029
about 30 plus something developers you

00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,360
can look at the commit log to see who is

00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:22,509
actually committing they are resources

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:26,950
from the corporation and with the

00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:30,460
foundation they help us build the mo DB

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:32,350
server however the foundation has the

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,940
final say in what goes into the server

00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:39,119
because the Merida foundation owns

00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,119
copyright to the MRED be server

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:45,659
I think this mostly answer your

00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:45,659
questions

00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:00,590
I saw on the website that Mario DB is

00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:04,070
developed in C++ yes is that true and

00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,450
there any other languages involve or is

00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,810
it true again sorry

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:10,250
is it true in is there any other

00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:13,280
languages that oh yes

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:16,910
so the code base so the main logic in

00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:18,710
the server is in C++ but we have the

00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:22,370
testing framework which is written in

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:26,770
Perl there are a few Python scripts but

00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:33,860
we try to not introduce another language

00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:35,570
and there is also just regular C so we

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:41,390
have certain parts for server which are

00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:43,940
basic C others are C++ there aren't any

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,830
other languages this is mainly due to

00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,200
historical reasons and right now for

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:50,150
practical reasons it's already hard to

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,600
deal with these two I think another one

00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:55,640
is just not worth it

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,040
although I have personally tried to get

00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:04,280
Python it and have received a lot of

00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:06,860
pushback from other developers I have

00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:12,530
another question why why is that Cohen

00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:14,180
mariadb oh so Murray DB comes so first

00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,750
of all let's start off how my scale got

00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:19,340
its name

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:21,800
so my scale got his name from Monte's so

00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:26,690
the creator of my scale along with david

00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:30,380
x mark they named mysql after my his

00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:36,290
daughter and marie DB was named after

00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:39,430
his youngest daughter which was maria so

00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,430
it just keeps the trend

00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:52,520
and then the seal like it's there and

00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:55,880
the seal was chosen by Maria okay okay

00:29:52,520 --> 00:30:00,010
so tomorrow I have a more technical talk

00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,870
as to what ten free has feature wise and

00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:05,809
I know this is not a database conference

00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:09,290
but I also have another talk about ten

00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:11,929
ten to the advanced queen features which

00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:14,630
can speed up performance on certain

00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:18,770
queries from ones that last two hours to

00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:20,990
execute to about two minutes so if you

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:25,160
would be interested in such a talk I am

00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:27,890
more than happy to give it I will try

00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,260
and schedule it for a birds of a feather

00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:35,270
session and if you want to feel free to

00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:39,220
attend okay and if you have any more

00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,220
questions I'm around here

00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,799
