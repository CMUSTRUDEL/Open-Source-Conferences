well nice to see so many nice to see so

00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:16,299
many people here last time at the front

00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:19,020
I'm not really I'm just gonna talk in

00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:21,189
the microphone really not really

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,429
actually give a presentation of any

00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:26,890
description so welcome to the BSP and

00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:31,179
meetings buff so I think might be useful

00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:34,989
at first to get a set of senses of who's

00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:37,660
here like who is thinking who's arranged

00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:40,210
to both in the past who's thinking of

00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:43,329
doing one or what about attendees and

00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,460
things like that so who's who's been to

00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:47,969
a BSP or above you can put your hands up

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,969
yeah

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,179
who would like to go to one I guess

00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:59,739
everyone kind of make sense obviously

00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,089
and oh

00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:04,210
could someone actually be sending for

00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:11,439
gobby I think a doc whilst we're doing

00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:14,320
this initial stuff so on it's all know

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:22,659
that gobby blah or whatever we're using

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:27,189
these things just said that rolling log

00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:32,350
with honey yeah so who would like to

00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:37,110
arrange above a BSP meeting that's led

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:41,320
to it I think you are though right yeah

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,400
okay so the other people were what were

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,479
they thinking of getting from this

00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,479
[Music]

00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:59,090
go ahead guy yeah so a couple of things

00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:01,640
I was speaking to a vicar the other day

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:05,060
that we're developing a lot of contacts

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,440
in India and they might be interested in

00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:11,569
organizing gatherings and maybe people

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,330
from other places might want to visit

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:17,450
them when they do that so maybe we could

00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,700
talk about that for a few minutes and

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,670
there's another event I've been invited

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,640
to a hackathon for girls that they're

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,769
organizing in Kosovo and so just looking

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,430
for feedback that I can give to those

00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:33,410
people to help them run their event I am

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,660
so there are lots of these other things

00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:39,319
where Debian can support people with

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,030
events in different ways and I just

00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,090
wanted to see if any of these things

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,150
might if people might have ideas for

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:56,350
them or anything else that we can do so

00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:56,350
I okay cool anyone else

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,380
[Music]

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:07,540
I've been to several days peace most of

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,110
them were traditional ones

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,330
at least I've no better term for that

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,150
like you go there you expect people to

00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,550
join in find bugs and repair packages

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,610
and as a DD you just have to overlook

00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:24,930
this and I mean door check this and

00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:29,170
upload like you're just a random

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:31,960
automated signer or something and it's

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:34,810
it was great to see new people join and

00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,650
then apply for nm and DD and and

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:41,740
whatever but I went to not really a PSP

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,530
in Paris in May which was a bit more

00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:48,460
than a PSP I mean there were many people

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:50,740
joining like oh how can I do something

00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,170
for Debian I don't know anything about

00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,660
dogs maybe I do some graphic stuff and

00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:02,740
so on and maybe it would be interesting

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:07,750
to have BSP have some tract who help

00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:10,540
people help Debian in some way that are

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,020
not only squashing bugs especially when

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:17,380
we are late in the release cycles the

00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:23,860
the aussie bugs are just crazy hard yeah

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:26,760
so it was possible to to ask people what

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:30,760
do you want to work on like Python and

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:35,260
teach them about the Deaf BOTS scene and

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:37,810
then help them understand how to

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,090
interact with the BTS and so on but

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,370
sometimes they would only look at

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,290
packaging a new option version which is

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,920
not really best question but still

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:52,980
helping maintenance so squashing bugs is

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:56,980
good but maybe this could be a bit more

00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:59,080
generic you know a way to help the

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:05,260
distribution and not onlys questioning

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:07,479
bugs with heavy hummus right yeah I mean

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,280
I guess being flexible to who shows up

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,500
right I mean that just kind of makes

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,889
since hopefully people will do that do

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:21,430
you think the name is putting people off

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:24,669
because it's bug squashing or I guess

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:27,970
the the acronym is a bit mysterious for

00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:30,070
newcomers because VSP is so many TL a

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:33,990
and you see what I mean

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:38,940
so mmm maybe we should have something

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:42,550
more explicit and all welcoming I guess

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:48,160
I didn't think about anything before

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:50,830
coming here so how to help Debian it's a

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,240
bit long but it's a bit more explicit

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,210
than VSP so yeah well I we wouldn't have

00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,620
to come up with a name right now but

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,200
yeah because there clearly some people

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,570
this is the one at the Mozilla offices

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:09,190
right exactly what was the attended says

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:11,560
pretty high wasn't it I don't have the

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:14,380
numbers and I guess the report is coming

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,140
in a bit late for whatever reason but

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:21,150
there were many people there and so many

00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:24,580
different skill sets and questions like

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:29,110
some attendance we wanted to have some

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:31,450
packaging 101 training session because

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,729
they didn't know how this worked and

00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:36,900
what the package will package and s

00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:39,640
built an - route and whatever so and

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,550
some people were coming because

00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,970
sponsored by work to spend a day or two

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,340
on this or whatever and they were like

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,070
oh I know already all this stuff and I

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,669
can choose like in my corner and that's

00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:58,720
fine but I guess compared to traditional

00:06:54,669 --> 00:07:03,600
VSP that we need to find more people and

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,600
with extended

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,940
flexibility as far as question and

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:13,380
teaching goes because you need to

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:16,720
explain a lot of things and if you're

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,990
tagged as the the guy who knows the

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,110
installer you get to install and debug

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,870
the installer when trying to win a TT

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:29,110
training session and that doesn't scale

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,990
so I guess we would need more people

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,930
than traditional DSP we're basically one

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:39,130
DeeDee can can upload all the things yes

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:44,190
oh but the that's really interesting on

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:49,449
the social level because we are not all

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:51,690
all occurs and we need to share to to

00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:56,080
get more blood into the project so I

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,970
mean what I would do if I sort of turned

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,530
up and there were a whole bunch there

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,500
are enough people to warrant some sort

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,620
of packaging tutorial or something I

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,199
would perhaps I didn't go through the

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,849
DEP comp slide archives and just find

00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,570
some packaging tutorial there yeah but

00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,669
organizing some things in advance

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:18,039
working out who's gonna be there what

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,840
they don't know I guess on the wiki

00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,180
pages for all these things you know I'm

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,280
thinking of turning up what am I

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,729
thinking of doing and for someone that

00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,440
could be some obscure I'll see bug the

00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:32,709
only dating fix cuz it's super technical

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,479
but it could be I would like to package

00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:35,469
and then in advance he will perhaps

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,320
might know that

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:41,950
oh there's two or three people who are

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,279
newbies anyone on it I seem to remember

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:49,990
a lot of it was also focused on

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:53,380
usability testing and we had maybe sales

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:56,320
people around so which is running on the

00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:01,120
wiki and being anonymous and so on

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:03,120
wasn't exactly a good match but on the

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,760
general case I guess I saw you

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,100
just have to say in advance I'm

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,990
interested in this or that topic so you

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,290
make sure that there are people to teach

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,550
you that and or at least people who've

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,550
been warned that there might be a

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,320
I mean I guess it's just a question of

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,710
the expectations for each different

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,240
event because if you do on the one hand

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,830
if you want to kind of have a nice

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,590
successful event and attract new people

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,940
and so on but clearly you if you say

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,220
have a weekend event you could easily

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,980
spend it if you wanted doing tutorials

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,900
on packaging and also things about how

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,900
to use the BTS and interacting with

00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:51,060
other people in Debian and so on which

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,430
could be useful long term but it's not

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,960
necessarily what organizers of these

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,870
events sometimes think of when they say

00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,120
let's have a bug squashing party so it's

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,980
it's difficult to say I mean what's more

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,210
useful but it's there's two different

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:09,710
types of event at least there there's no

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,210
reason to run them independently yeah

00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,640
sure but again you just need it's I

00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,680
think sometimes people in the project

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,480
think oh let's have a beat here as I

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:24,270
have a PSP and imagine they're gonna get

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,760
15 backing out aking yeah well 15 hours

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,830
of 15 people squashing thousands of bugs

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,990
and they haven't necessarily thought

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,750
that they might even though they try

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,860
often to attract external people they

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:40,230
haven't thought about the implications

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:43,500
of that necessarily one question I'd

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:48,450
like to ask anyone who's run a BSP or

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:51,300
been to one is where they have failed or

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:54,420
like have been unsuccessful so all

00:10:51,300 --> 00:11:00,060
things it definitely haven't worked so

00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,860
if anyone can because I've always been

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,520
successful

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:08,649
unfortunately stage um mostly yeah

00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,649
[Music]

00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:17,370
the trick for me for having a good BSP

00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:20,550
is just making sure you announce it in

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:23,339
plenty of time encourage as many people

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:27,449
to turn up as you can you know none of

00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:30,059
this is rocket science and to be honest

00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:32,220
it helps for me I'll admit it it makes

00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,199
it really easy that we've got a very apt

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,269
good active community already in the UK

00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:38,279
you know there's a bunch of folks who

00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,230
will just turn up when you organise a

00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:45,029
PSP and you know you can expect them

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:47,759
nine every time I hope I do wonder how

00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:51,449
much harder it is for other people when

00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:54,839
they don't have that so if anybody wants

00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:57,449
to has anybody struggle to get people to

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,490
turn not to a PSP certainly been at some

00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:00,959
event in another country in Europe where

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,939
they just said a couple of people who

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,189
organized it and basically didn't really

00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:11,220
get many others which was it doesn't

00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:13,920
necessary cause a problem well yeah the

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,769
last PSP that I went to in motion grab

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,740
back from my point of view I went

00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:23,040
without too much too many expectations I

00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:28,620
wanted to to work on something because

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:31,379
it was two months before release so on

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,629
the first day I was pairing with some

00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:38,879
guys and we were working on some crazy

00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:41,790
package on the second day basically I

00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,279
didn't have much to do so I was a little

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:48,179
bit bored I tried to find something but

00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:50,029
there was not many bugs to work on from

00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:55,110
the beginning the beginner point of view

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:59,970
so so basically from my point of view it

00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:06,360
was not really successful okay so to

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:09,300
have more wider more wider view on this

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:14,550
it would be good for organisers to have

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:17,750
some schema or some somewhat as a theme

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:20,200
or some list of proposed box lists off

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,990
of some

00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,019
I don't know so some proposals or at

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:28,899
least in the beginning - okay

00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:31,360
we have those people's who are experts

00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:34,060
in this or or this or who want to work

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,430
on something and then we could I know

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,920
pair or something because otherwise it

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,019
will be okay if you know something then

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,699
you start working on needs and it

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:47,470
doesn't matter if you are on the books

00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:48,910
questioning party or not yeah and you go

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,730
back to slightly what Kippy was saying

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,850
where it gets harder and harder as the

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,279
freeze yeah and who are you looking

00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:00,310
through this list and you look at a bug

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,279
and it's got like 25,000 replies to it

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,230
and you just know that you're 20 minutes

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,579
that you've got left of that day is just

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,459
not gonna be the help no I think that

00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,389
can be a problem for people we can we

00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:13,779
encourage people to have

00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:17,199
BSP's as we get closer and close to the

00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:18,639
release but for people who are not

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,529
already working on some piece of

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,389
particular piece of software unfamiliar

00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:25,600
with it it gets harder and harder for

00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:28,209
them to actually do much useful so what

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,540
mean if of course we want help yeah but

00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:32,380
it's also I think it can be a bit

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,510
demotivating people who go to their

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,550
first PSP as I kind of I want to get

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,949
involved with Debian and then see this

00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:44,470
list of bugs that they have no real

00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:48,130
chance of fighting yeah to have some

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:51,250
tasks for them I mean then I I dearly

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,060
but I again I'm I'm it's hard to say

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,860
that you should make that a

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,470
responsibility of organizers to do

00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,839
because it's a lot of work to find tasks

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,010
for new people to do there's obviously

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,870
much more interesting for the new people

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,880
if they can have a real task that's

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,529
going to be useful but it's hard to

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,819
locate those then normally actually

00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,190
means someone is to basically have done

00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:10,959
the work already but then just leave a

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,190
description of it rather than upload

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,170
their change or something

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:20,769
yeah which is yeah it's hard there was a

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,880
discussion recently she wasn't so

00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:25,420
recently I think it might have been a

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,980
year or two ago about putting tags in

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,769
the BTS

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,600
on issues that might be easy for

00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:34,959
newcomers things that

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,660
and applicants for JSOC could do those

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,060
bugs or whatever they might not be

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,980
released critical bugs either but

00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,199
they're still useful for someone who's

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,269
building a package for the first time so

00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:51,730
I'm not sure if that's progressed if

00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:54,490
anyone's tried tagging the bugs I seem

00:15:51,730 --> 00:16:02,620
to recall that but I can't I don't know

00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:04,569
the current status yes they're all a lot

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,199
of bugs in the BTS tag newcomer borer

00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:11,170
not everybody is using them maybe it's

00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:14,579
gonna be good plan to actually publicize

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:18,519
that more make it more more visible I

00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:21,579
mean when I from BSP yes it can be

00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,709
difficult to find things for fern on

00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:27,540
Dedes you know just you know local

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,540
interested people to get involved with

00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:33,100
yeah it's hard and actually yet so

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,370
coming up with this pre-prepared list

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:40,990
like that would help a lot when we what

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:45,130
we've had recently is picking gazaam an

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,689
example Andy is an on uploading Dede has

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,720
learned a lot about packaging and

00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:53,800
whatever at a BSP by digging through

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,899
looking for licensing problems so I've

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,360
helped I've helped him with a bit of

00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:02,529
scripting to pick packages apart looking

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,329
for problems in fonts for example and

00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:06,039
actually he's look he's learnt quite a

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,630
lot from that and it's something that

00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:10,329
he's caught he's carried on with and

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,669
he's um you know dogged determination to

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,770
get to a problem that actually most

00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:16,720
packages would run away for because oh

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,549
it's a licensing problem it's hard yeah

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,240
that's also I mean there is a more

00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:24,159
general thing there that though often

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,230
again we're having a PSP towards a

00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:28,270
release trying to reduce numbers of bugs

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,640
and we're thinking and that mindset for

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,860
new people it can actually be easier and

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,120
to get going by doing what's essentially

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:40,150
QA work to create bugs yeah and more

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,710
than just trying to install because if

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,330
someone turns up like oh there's no bugs

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,340
you to actually fix at this bug

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,070
switching part

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,570
we're just try installing testing I mean

00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,740
that could become across a little

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:56,260
patronizing Navy or its previous I

00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:01,059
depends what level but I mean there are

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:03,340
I think often as people who have often

00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:05,679
the project don't necessarily get round

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,840
to filing bugs on little annoyances so

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,909
actually people who are new and not so

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,360
familiar with the quirks of things might

00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:18,309
be better at getting doing that that's

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:22,000
true that's true just a couple of other

00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:23,799
things that could be helpful and is I

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,140
mean for most packages we can probably

00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:28,659
work out what programming language is

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,929
involved if it's a Java package a Python

00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:34,450
package so you'd probably end up with

00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:36,429
hundreds of thousands of bugs against H

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,220
programming language but at least for

00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,809
someone who already knows Java if we can

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,029
cut down what they're looking at to a

00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:46,210
list of say a hundred or two hundred

00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:47,860
Java bugs that they can start to get

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,390
their head around that instead of saying

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,029
that there are like a hundred thousand

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:55,299
open bugs in the BTS they can say there

00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:57,220
may be a hundred Java bugs that might be

00:18:55,299 --> 00:19:00,789
relevant to them that might be a useful

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,590
exercise for them another thing that

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,690
they might want to focus on is upstream

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,789
bugs so people who have no packaging

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:09,399
experience but they're they're good with

00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:12,970
Java they might be happy to just go and

00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:14,860
put a pull request into github and get

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,450
it fixed there and that will trickle

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,450
down to the package in the future

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,809
following up on your first idea of

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,730
finding bugs for specific languages is

00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,860
depth tags still alive because that's

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,440
what that's one of the things that death

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:36,970
tags worth doing and it would be quite

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:39,279
easy to enhance ug debug search to

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:42,250
filter based on depth tags in the to be

00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:45,000
a way to get a list of works for

00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,000
specific language

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:07,920
awkward silence I had another topic I

00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:12,030
was going to raise but if people want to

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:17,120
continue with the BSP theme I don't want

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:20,880
to interrupt we can always come back

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,920
okay so one of the other things I've

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:30,270
been discussing in a few places recently

00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:32,040
is using iCalendar to gather data about

00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,860
different events in different

00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,230
communities not just in Debian but to

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,480
publish them in iCalendar files and to

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,610
try and aggregate that and search on

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,180
that I know there are some people who

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:47,340
you know they have they want to go to

00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,800
events they want to meet people for

00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,620
whatever reason for the career for

00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,500
learning and they want to be able to

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,540
search for events preferably with a free

00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,460
software theme as well some of them are

00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:03,870
looking more generically at anything

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,820
that's IT related or anything Java you

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,820
know there are alternatives out there

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,330
like meetup which is some people are

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,370
happy using that other people and not so

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,470
keen on meet up being a proprietary

00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:19,680
solution you know there's a bit like

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:22,620
Facebook and they have usage fees as

00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,440
well so it would be interesting to build

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:28,410
an alternative to that and I think you

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,780
could sort of aggregate iCalendar feeds

00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:33,360
from different sources in much the same

00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,900
way that the planet system aggregates

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,520
RSS feeds so if we were getting

00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,530
different organizations publishing their

00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,660
events even if they've only got two or

00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:46,170
three of them H year and we could pull

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,240
those in and help people search and then

00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,800
that would also provide opportunities

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,660
for people to meet so we can say off

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,310
some Debian people will be at this other

00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,680
event and you can meet them there and

00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:58,320
get your key signed and so there are

00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,370
lots of opportunities in that that's so

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,560
tomorrow morning at 10:00 I've put in a

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,660
both discussion if people want to talk

00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,880
about Debbie and local groups and what

00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,520
that might mean in one one way of

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,130
instantiation of that is

00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,040
I think could be a better way of

00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,780
searching for events that are near to

00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,920
people in Sun him again we do advertises

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,630
in lots of ways at the moment but I

00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,880
think it's not maybe we could improve

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,130
things that that's true because I was

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,020
immediately thinking I used it lwn

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:32,570
calendar for that but that's kind of

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:34,700
niche and won't have like misc pub

00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,140
meetups right because they clearly some

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:41,740
sort of limit I mean I've seen Debbie

00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:47,060
and BSP on the the elderly on calendar I

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:50,210
think the Paris one was example but you

00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:54,620
know for developers meeting at a train

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:56,300
station via Forbes or people welcome to

00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,640
come along course yeah that obviously

00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,740
wouldn't go on there but it's true

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,020
people do me too even even apart from

00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,870
any kind of formalized groups people do

00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:08,150
often meet just in a pub for a few

00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,580
developers say when they might be happy

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,310
for some newcomer to come along but it's

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,200
at the moment a bit tricky to really

00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:19,100
advertise that it's kind of overkill to

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:23,060
put out a Debian announcement that three

00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:25,130
people are going to be in a bar and the

00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,990
announcement doesn't really reach the

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,510
new person either why is that a new

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:33,140
person might not be on the mailing list

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,580
but they go looking for some reason

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,220
they're looking for something and if we

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,870
can make it if we can put it there so

00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:42,290
that they'll stumble across it either on

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:45,830
a website or whatever else and in

00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:47,840
Switzerland the Linux user groups run a

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:50,540
thing that aggregates a few different

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,620
iCalendar feeds so that's f writer min

00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:56,590
CH and so that's much more simple

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,300
because they all fit on a single HTML

00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:02,030
calendar you know in Edinburgh as well

00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,160
and other places as a tech calendar or

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,510
something which is not only free

00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,130
software type things but again people

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,840
follow to see lots of different events

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,520
but in generally in the world it's not

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:15,590
really available yeah hmm

00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:18,920
so it's partly served by the the events

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,630
page on the wiki right yes and on the

00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,880
actual website there is an events page

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,260
as well or at least used to be oh right

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,910
okay maybe has been killed by

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:38,990
I know it never was sorry this is own

00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:41,390
video is happening another thing again

00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,280
with I don't want to go too much on to

00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,560
what I hope people can discuss tomorrow

00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,540
but one thing is on that reply is

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,060
generally for BSP and so on any kind of

00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,740
Debian meeting is that I think a lot of

00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:55,040
if we want to attract people it's also

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,750
you need some kind of more than just

00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,390
one-off things because a lot of people

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,920
if they see one event happening in their

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,660
area they might if they're keen they

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,980
might come along but a lot of people

00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,300
it's kind of when there's the second or

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:09,500
third event and I think I'll really

00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:12,350
actually get round to going if you have

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:17,540
some kind of well one of me any question

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:20,450
is are there any properly regular Debbie

00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,610
and events like is in not maybe now

00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,930
obviously ones every year but I can't

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,480
think of any that are you know every

00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,490
three months there cheese and wine party

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,680
happens every year yeah but that's every

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,140
year yeah other ones with Debbie in

00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:37,880
Zurich is the first Tuesday of the month

00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:41,390
in part by the main stations such things

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,400
do exist as the answer but not yeah and

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,640
sometimes there's only one developer

00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,500
there it's often users as well so

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,320
there's always a meeting even at

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,710
Christmas or in the summer and there are

00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,760
always a few people come to that meeting

00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:59,960
because I think you're right that the

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:02,330
regularity is a I mean I think the ideal

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,730
is something like the same again someone

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:07,520
who is gonna make sure they're in the

00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:10,670
bar every month but even if it's not a

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,650
fixed date just the fact that it's once

00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,240
if there's what if things happen every

00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,460
six months or even every year in the

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,980
same city whatever people who are around

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,300
the area well more likely to eventually

00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,580
notice that even if they missed this

00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,530
year's one even if it's only annual if

00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,300
they missed this year's what barbecue

00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,710
then they think oh maybe I should go to

00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,690
next year's barbecue whatever it is I

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,800
mean exactly in fact that's a really

00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,480
interesting point because someone will

00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,330
say you know what's what's happening in

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,720
London or whatever and I'll I can say oh

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:40,950
yeah there's this thing or

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,930
if someone says they're gonna be in in

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,490
the UK in August I'll be like oh yeah

00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:48,330
there's this regular thing going on in

00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:51,120
the barbecue so having those rather than

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:55,230
just a one-off that could be a random

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,780
DSP maybe we could learn these from

00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:01,230
hacker spaces or hacker communities I

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:04,710
know that for 2600 which is hacker home

00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:09,480
phone phreaking community they meet in

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:12,210
many cities mostly in US but even in Tel

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,030
Aviv for example every first Friday or

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,100
Saturday of the month hacker spaces for

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:20,640
example they also meet regularly and you

00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:24,110
can go to web page and see and many

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,910
people who go to different cities are

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:30,990
are looking for those pages to see if

00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:35,700
there is such group and such meeting in

00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:37,230
an is indeed given time for the PSP kind

00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,260
of angle as well though there is there

00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,250
are there will be many people who are in

00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,490
cities who are never going to have a

00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:47,780
local regular thing and even many people

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:50,250
who are not necessary keen on going to a

00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,810
big event I mean so again it's some

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,250
people who turn up at BSP's it's not

00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,620
necessarily their first choice of how to

00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:57,240
get involved but it's just aim the only

00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,980
method they've found I mean I know we've

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,950
again over the years they've been many

00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,510
attempts to have well we have things

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,580
like Debian mentors have been attempts

00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,440
to have more different welcoming IRC

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,940
channels or different ways to help

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,510
people who come from different methods

00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,860
but I still is a sort of weak spot

00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,890
somehow that we're not

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:20,280
I don't again I didn't there's any magic

00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:22,020
solution but it is a more general thing

00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,880
rather than just about these events I

00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:28,440
mean I can add BSP I have seen people

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:31,710
well I've seen BSP or other Debian

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,750
meetings of work meetings where which we

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:37,920
explicitly advertise as not having any

00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:39,570
introductory talk packaging tutorial and

00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,330
so on but in reality if you get someone

00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,620
turn up if everyone just ignores them

00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:47,120
and they sit in the corner it's a bit

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,760
sad yeah yeah and there's the same

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,210
thing really online that again people

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,559
there are like I would believe there's

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,230
quite a lot of people kind of hanging

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,030
around online on the edges of the Debian

00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:01,610
community without really ever quite

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:03,020
getting involved just because we somehow

00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:09,500
we don't manage to make the connection

00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:12,740
mm-hmm just another thing I would raise

00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:15,070
is that there are also groups that are

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,200
not strictly Debian groups that have

00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:20,690
regular meetings like let's say someone

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,460
wanted to do Debian stuff in Albania I

00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:27,200
would send them to the open labs group

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:28,700
they have people who use Debian you know

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,600
they're reliable they have regular

00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,490
activities they have fun activities and

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,040
we wouldn't need to set up another group

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:39,590
or other meetings there it's just the

00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:43,250
same in Manchester I've been to meetings

00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:44,990
of Manchester free software there's

00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,630
probably not enough critical mass there

00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:50,240
for a debian group but that other group

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:52,790
would would welcome people and would

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,150
have Debian topics or a Debian speaker

00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:57,470
from time to time so I've encouraged

00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,929
these groups to actually put themselves

00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:02,200
on the local groups wiki as well so

00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:04,790
maybe this is also a topic for tomorrow

00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,809
but if people are aware of other groups

00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:10,610
that welcoming Debian speakers and then

00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:14,030
that can be a forum for doing things

00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:19,640
instead of stretching ourselves to have

00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:22,700
a dedicated meeting for Debian so when

00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,190
is the local groups tomorrow if I recall

00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,390
it's 10 o'clock there's been scheduled

00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,120
I'm just bringing up schedule yeah it

00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:32,860
says 10 o'clock in BO is this both I

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,840
think we are both so yeah so try to

00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,860
stumble in with your hangover from the

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,860
cheese and wine and

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:49,770
this is not that difficult people just

00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:54,050
come and sleep in here the very local

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:54,050
group some Joker

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:23,150
so obviously I also want a fairly

00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,940
well-known big annual get-together for

00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:26,960
Debian people in the UK at the barbecue

00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,140
I host in my place

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,560
does anybody else try to do any big just

00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:35,300
social event at all have you got

00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,830
anything you know anything to share

00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,230
about that anything that works well

00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:49,150
anything that doesn't well not to drop

00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:49,150
him in it but tincho your mother Mike

00:31:49,720 --> 00:32:00,830
how we doing for time so yeah I wanted

00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:03,410
to either a I have a nice no regular but

00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:05,990
whenever we feel like doing and local

00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:09,530
events that is purely social in Ireland

00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:19,460
it says it's a small community there so

00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:20,900
we go sorry sorry so yeah that would be

00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,820
well which is go to the pub announce it

00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,680
in all the local mailing list sometimes

00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:29,840
we have somebody who's not regular

00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:31,490
Debian contributor joining us that yeah

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,960
the usual participate on the wiki

00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,780
announce it in the local mailing list

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,240
the horseplay well and then it's

00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:41,840
starting to become regular organized and

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,710
yearly event two times already in in

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,240
Barcelona

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:48,740
well Catalonia in May and that that

00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,860
worked pretty well it was purely

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,420
technical but very different from Def

00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:57,680
Con for anything because it's just the

00:32:53,420 --> 00:33:01,790
camp part so just sitting by the pool

00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:05,810
and hugging and I really like that event

00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:07,550
so I will try to make it continues yeah

00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,310
well I liked it too

00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:12,650
it's very good yeah can you talk more

00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:15,170
how regular is the one in you have been

00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:19,730
running in Dublin or well when I am

00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:22,640
there which is not always a I tried to

00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:25,910
make it more regular once a month

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,679
yeah scheduling things and sometimes we

00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,360
are only three or four so not to happen

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,179
all the time but at some point what's

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,040
happening every month nice but that was

00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:36,860
still on an ad hoc basis in other words

00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,260
it wasn't the second Tuesday

00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,000
no it was the second Monday of the month

00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,490
in the same pub every I had a wheel

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,960
that's cool but differences not around

00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:49,760
people forget to call it and yeah that's

00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,230
a that's a pair would have a very small

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,020
community like we have in Ireland and

00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:59,809
what's her numbers where we usually

00:33:54,020 --> 00:34:03,620
three or four six tops TD so yeah this

00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:07,130
audience yeah and we had a couple of

00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:09,590
times a guy joining us that was visiting

00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,240
Dublin and he's not the dirty M but now

00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,659
he's trying to get him more involved so

00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,659
that's good

00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:20,179
both times that it's not air for my the

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,300
city with the project that like to come

00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:25,730
and chattin hmm so at least this one

00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,840
case I can say that I think is getting

00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,609
more involved in there and thanks to

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,000
this meeting so that's good that's good

00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:31,000
that's good

00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:39,619
a different question on this is I'd be

00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:44,000
interested to know from people who have

00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:46,250
been organizing bsp or other debris in

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,940
types of meetings is do they how do they

00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:51,619
feel about the current level of Debian

00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,230
money on these events I mean do people

00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:56,510
think they're BSP would be a thousand

00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:58,579
times better if they got ten times as

00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,880
much money towards it or it doesn't make

00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:05,720
any difference or what I have something

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,180
to say about that actually em well Chris

00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:11,299
contacted me but I also really too late

00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,980
and difficult organize it but yeah the

00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:14,990
the problem with the one I organized in

00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,299
Catalonia is a bit expensive because

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:20,660
there's no formalities are also

00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:22,039
everybody pays their own room and so for

00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,510
people in Spain actually it was

00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:28,220
difficult at times which is not optimal

00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:29,450
so that case didn't say it's right

00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:33,319
because they're paying essentially

00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:37,789
holiday rates if I was still cheaper

00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:38,450
than a high season but pain like 15

00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:41,359
euros a day

00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,690
sorry they have low salaries yeah that's

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,700
a thing

00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:47,230
Saracens been a pretty low one and

00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:50,420
traveling in Spain is not cheap so

00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:53,329
having some money maybe to subsidize the

00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:57,109
hotel room or something like that will

00:35:53,329 --> 00:36:00,650
help but at the same time I am doing

00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:04,609
this event with the idea of no setup so

00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:06,710
no sponsors no no bull Suri's or

00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:09,079
anything like that so that's why it was

00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,180
difficult also to try to make it work in

00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:13,220
a way that they can go help but if there

00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,020
was some kind of lump sum that maybe I

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,279
can put towers that the rooms doesn't

00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,569
like that I will probably have a lot of

00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:21,799
people or if people can apply

00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:24,170
individually as long as I don't have to

00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:26,599
do it it's fine right because otherwise

00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,010
you wouldn't do the event quite frankly

00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,079
no it's not that

00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:32,089
no I will I was still though it's like

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,420
I've been evolving a lot worse than that

00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:37,279
but the idea was to keep the event and

00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,829
easy thing and not make it too

00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:41,779
complicated like this year organize it a

00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:43,940
couple of days I just called the hotel

00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:46,270
they Reno me said they were doing it

00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:50,349
again which day's work for you ok

00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:51,970
like do it done then just call a cup of

00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:54,940
calls to the bus stations to get updated

00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,780
timetables and those basically it's yeah

00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,970
so that's great

00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,369
yes that also means that you can attend

00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:02,950
the event because in some senses an

00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:03,940
organizer is just being the organizer

00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:07,750
and they're there

00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:10,720
sure well there's like they don't touch

00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:14,290
that laptop because they just say that

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,740
was my experience in Def Con fate I only

00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:19,210
did organization I'm not even sleeping

00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,650
you didn't sort of go you didn't do that

00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:25,540
conveyed in that sense yeah yeah and so

00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:27,820
for this in this case was great for me

00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:29,109
because I had a lot of work done like

00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,930
much more that we'll do in Def Con for

00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:36,099
any other place mm-hmm so it's great to

00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:38,170
have it allô allô effort event is more

00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:39,970
sustainable for for a small team

00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:43,960
especially yeah especially the team is

00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:46,750
one so I guess it'd be sort of difficult

00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:51,660
for Debian to justify funds on hotel

00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:56,740
rooms next to a pool right yeah maybe

00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:58,990
but things around like travel I I don't

00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:02,380
see why

00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:04,300
Debbie and the the normal PSP travel

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:08,560
rules which i think is a hundred year or

00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:13,060
100 us for travel couldn't can be used

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,710
for that yeah if every person will apply

00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:18,160
individually maybe and we can say that

00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:20,320
okay this this event it's okay for this

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,050
kind of funds and even if it's not a PSP

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,540
because we are not doing PSP things bow

00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:31,900
speak for yourself sorry I did some okay

00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:33,250
yeah and I didn't recognize a PSP but if

00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,290
something like that was like

00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,760
pre-approved and everybody will apply

00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:39,910
individually according to their needs

00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,800
whatever well then I like it we'll have

00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,470
a travel or paint part of the room or

00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,680
whatever just tell people to make it

00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,400
more affordable take away these people

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,140
thank you

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,990
quickly today's people just saw on the

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:54,369
edge like it's sort of oh there was

00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,140
there was a few people that told me they

00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:58,020
couldn't attend because of money right

00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,740
yeah

00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:03,510
I was gonna suggest having some figures

00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,859
like this hundred dollars that was

00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:10,890
raised a few years ago or 100 euros can

00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:12,450
also encourage people to organize events

00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,150
like if they know that there's a

00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,410
possibility that they're going to get

00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,359
funding or that there's a minimum amount

00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,339
they will get they will actually start

00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,740
thinking how can we use this effectively

00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:24,859
and have an event and so there might

00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,970
even be other things that could be

00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:29,010
advertised like if you organize a

00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:32,190
hackathon or if you organize something

00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:34,980
else Debian will commit this or that or

00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:38,300
will guarantee to send a speaker or

00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,079
something like that there's different

00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:43,440
encouragement for people to organize

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,329
events because some of the requests

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,460
maybe Chris can comment more on the

00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:50,010
requests that he receives for funding I

00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,520
imagine if they don't have guidance some

00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:55,410
of them might not know exactly what is

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,180
reasonable and what isn't but if they're

00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:59,790
actually guided to say organize

00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,680
something over a weekend and we'll give

00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:04,400
this much money and then they'll

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,890
structure their requests around that I

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,150
think that's right I mean I've had

00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:12,839
example the early earth replacement

00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:15,089
sprint I had some males you know

00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:18,329
requesting sort of pre-approval for you

00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:20,040
know funds etc and it was sort of clear

00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:22,200
that they weren't really sure that this

00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,440
was obviously going to be available and

00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,599
so my reply was like well yes of course

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,660
are you sure you just need that amount I

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:34,470
mean let's get this done so I think

00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:36,299
there is some sort of perception there

00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:40,170
that can it could be modified and then

00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:42,599
people would be keener to to organise

00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:45,869
these things and I'd feel less stressed

00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,869
about doing so say which would be more

00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:53,460
more than happenin etcetera etcetera

00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:56,839
well in Mexico City we have done mainly

00:40:53,460 --> 00:41:02,069
the Debian day we have organized it and

00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:05,280
most of the time it is attended by a lot

00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:10,130
of people but for example to to organize

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:15,840
a book squashing party or some sprint

00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:20,480
something more focuses on Debian some

00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:26,010
topic it is mm is more difficult because

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:31,050
in Mexico we are few people into the

00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:36,380
Debian project directly and trying to

00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:36,380
push initiatives or getting involved and

00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:46,880
first we need to to make grow the

00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:52,790
interest to participate in in Debian

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:56,790
like translations packaging or even

00:41:52,790 --> 00:42:01,190
designing something like that because in

00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:06,930
self-management we have achieved since

00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:10,800
2010 to organise events like the V&A or

00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:15,119
even release parties about even Jessie

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:19,650
and stretch the stunt crystal face so

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:23,300
now the challenge is to to make grow

00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:27,180
interest about book squashing partition

00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:34,500
and generate contributors from Mexico to

00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:35,880
to Debian when I had actually have a lot

00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,220
of people come to these events but

00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,950
mostly Debian users and it made us work

00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,750
myself included have not this is the

00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,180
first time I'm trying to become like

00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,920
closer to see what how can I actually

00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:50,730
get involved in Debian it so this is a

00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:53,550
barrier so far as I wish ever large

00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,990
large community of Debian users that

00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:57,359
we've grown over the years but we just

00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:59,910
haven't taken I haven't been able to get

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:03,300
through the additional step to become

00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:07,109
contributors and you've obviously taken

00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:10,200
that step and what did you hear I

00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:13,310
figured this out oh I see yeah problem

00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,840
maybe you've clearly made some steps

00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:21,090
release mentor that I made it here right

00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:22,090
no no exactly so in that sense what made

00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,220
you come here

00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:26,950
instead of just being like wow that

00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,990
means people what we've just been doing

00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:30,490
this for a long for so long have so many

00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:36,820
people like such a big community that's

00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:38,230
using Debian and and so Phil close to

00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,120
the project even though haven't gotten

00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,980
involved formally so it seems important

00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,170
because it's like okay we have we've

00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,820
built a whole community around this and

00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:48,040
we need to be more involved to ensure

00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:50,110
that Debian meets our needs and that

00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:53,800
we're and we're a part of that process

00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:56,140
in some way but there's a lot to work to

00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,970
be done Jonathan has been kind of

00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,820
instrumental and kind of giving those

00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:08,560
introductions and how we can take those

00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:15,000
additional steps cool so um three try

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,000
and wrap up any final parting thoughts

00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:31,550
who thank you I hope you see what some

00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:33,700
sort of event that you organize thank

00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,700
you

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,099
