	00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:11,930
so this talk is about freedom box free

00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,680
Libre personal server built within w n--

00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:18,710
a little bit about myself my name is

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,220
James Ellroy I've been working on the

00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:25,160
freedom X project since 2013 about four

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:30,859
years now and I've also been a debian

00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:40,760
maintainer since May of this year is a

00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:42,800
volume good okay so I'll give a very

00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,120
brief introduction to the project mostly

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,490
for people who might not have heard

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,870
about it before

00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,940
and then I'll mostly talk about the

00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,520
current status of the project I'm gonna

00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,830
give some technical details and talk

00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,060
about how you can help the project and

00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:01,310
at the end we'll have some time for

00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:04,400
questions so first what is freedom box

00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:07,610
well it's a Debian project also a Debian

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,250
pure blend this means that all of the

00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:15,080
software used in freedom box is packaged

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:18,070
within Debian and the purpose is to make

00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,720
it easy to run a personal server

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,800
especially replacing third-party

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,220
services that would otherwise be

00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,920
collecting all your data so we want

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,290
people to to run these free to freedom

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,409
box in their home as their own personal

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,580
server and hosting their own web apps

00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:39,229
and other network applications and

00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,210
really the goal of the project is zero

00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:44,750
administration because you shouldn't

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:47,330
have to be a Debian expert or a system

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,070
administrator to use a freedom box it

00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:55,460
should be it shouldn't require any

00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:57,350
special technical skill so just an idea

00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,409
what it looks like this is a screenshot

00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:04,270
of plinth our web interface and showing

00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:04,270
some of the apps that you can install

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,160
and so I'll talk about the current

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,739
status of the project we had our first

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,830
stable release in Debian stretch this

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:20,900
year meaning the core package is for

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,819
freedom backs are all in nwn stretch and

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,769
we build live images based on using

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:29,300
Debian stretch for a number of different

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:32,310
devices and virtual machines including

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:36,860
lots of different ARM based single board

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:40,950
computers and x86 architectures as well

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:44,299
and besides the live images you can turn

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,650
any W in system into a freedom box

00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:48,630
there's instructions on the wiki and how

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,560
to do that right now you have to install

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,120
a package and then run a setup script in

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,799
the near future we want to automate that

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,560
step so you're just have to install

00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:03,330
package so talk about some of the

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:08,010
features that are in the current release

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:12,209
in stable infinite ed is the server for

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:14,880
Gabby the collaborative text editor a

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:19,019
key wiki allows you to easily create a

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,810
wiki or blog for XMPP we have each a

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:25,950
Verde for the server side and we also

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:30,209
have a XMPP web client there's a sip

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:35,639
server retro mumble is a voice chat

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:39,889
server as well radical is a Cal dev card

00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:42,540
dev server for calendar and address book

00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:46,010
we also have lesson crypt integration

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,420
which means you can easily acquire a

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,630
official certificate for a domain that

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,209
points to your freedom box and then

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:58,889
pravakar is a web proxy that also will

00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:00,810
do some ad blocking Open VPN you can run

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:04,049
the server side on the freedombox and

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:08,910
then connect to it using a client on

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:11,359
your laptop or a mobile client tour we

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,580
have a couple different features like

00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:16,979
you can download packages over tor for a

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,140
little bit extra privacy you can also

00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:19,329
set up a hidden service which will give

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,459
you

00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:24,610
onion address which you can access

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,220
through the tor browser and you also

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,740
have the option of running as a a relay

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,939
or bridge relay to help support the Tor

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,159
network fossil is an IRC client

00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:38,139
basically keeps you connected to IRC

00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,939
networks the freedombox will stay

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,509
connected and you can access it from

00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:47,710
different devices and then there's also

00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:51,360
a BitTorrent web interfaces and there's

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,710
other features this is just a sample

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,469
some of the upcoming features that are

00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:00,759
being worked on either in testing or in

00:04:56,469 --> 00:05:03,669
an upcoming release a sync thing is a

00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,729
file synchronization tool it's mostly

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:08,770
peer-to-peer but the freedombox can act

00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,750
as an additional peer that's always up

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,979
and running so you always have access to

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:17,219
your files matrix is a newer

00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:20,620
communication protocol a federated

00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:22,870
communications protocol it's become

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,639
quite popular recently and there's a

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,009
home server package called matrix

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,270
synapse and you can install and run

00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:30,270
you'll be able to install and run that

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,969
on freedombox

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,680
tahoe laughs is a file another service

00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:37,330
where you can upload files and it does

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,339
things like encrypting the files and

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:43,620
splitting them up into different pieces

00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:46,449
that are that are set to other servers

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,449
and then diaspora

00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:52,629
the Federated social network is

00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:58,710
currently in contribute back to Debian

00:05:52,629 --> 00:06:04,509
main in the near future and then SSO

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:06,940
this basically allows you to to log into

00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:08,199
a one of the web apps on the freedombox

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,560
without having to type in your password

00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,900
again you just log into plants once and

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,879
then it sets a cookie that will

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,879
authenticate you to any other web apps

00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:23,560
and just to talk about some of the

00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:25,349
supported hardware we have live images

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,909
available for a number of different

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:32,470
single board computers the olynyk see no

00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:36,190
boards which I have one up here

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:39,700
the QB truck in cubieboard BeagleBone

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:43,420
black pc do we know there's also images

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:47,560
for Raspberry Pi to act does currently

00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,900
use non-free firmware but there's a free

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,620
firmware replacement being developed now

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,800
it's just not quite at a state where we

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,840
can use it for our purposes and then

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,530
besides that there's images for x86

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,000
architectures and virtual machines but

00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,220
besides all that if you don't have one

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,020
of the devices on this list but you have

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,730
a device that can run Debian of course

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:21,010
it can also be a freedom box okay now

00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:25,390
I'll just give a quick demo that's quite

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:27,580
large so this is the the front page of

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,110
plinth where it shows all the apps that

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,970
you have installed and are currently

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:35,200
enabled and basically you can click on

00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,120
some of these services and it'll show

00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,690
you some information and you can go to

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,090
configure it and then for apps like Web

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:47,950
Apps you can click it'll just take you

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:52,510
to that application then up here you

00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:58,200
have the list of apps all the ones that

00:07:52,510 --> 00:08:03,310
are available to install and typically

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:05,350
click on one of those and it will give

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,790
you some status of the service and some

00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,790
basic configuration as well

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,770
and then there's a Help button which has

00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:30,659
the manual and about page configuration

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:32,940
tab some basic system configuration

00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:34,500
options in here like if you wanted to

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,649
get a lesson in clipper to forget you

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:42,050
could do that through this page or if

00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:44,519
you want to set up the network there's a

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:47,959
basically a front-end to network manager

00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:53,940
where you can configure a network

00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:55,230
through here and a number of other

00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:04,649
options but I'll talk more about those

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:06,630
later alright I want to talk about some

00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:10,290
of the core packages that we use in the

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:12,120
freedombox freedombox setup is the main

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,980
package that depends on everything else

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,430
basically so it depends on plinths the

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,269
web interface apache 2 and some other

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:24,120
useful tools and it also contains the

00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,620
setup scripts which mostly just are to

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,529
enable certain Apache modules that we

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,910
use or that we expect and it also

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:34,350
includes first boot scripts these will

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,790
if you use a live image and you boot up

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,160
the device it'll check like the current

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,589
network topology to configure the

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,740
network connections and also generate

00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:45,740
keys for like SSH and SSL if they're

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,899
needed

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,199
so plus the web interface is a Python

00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,870
application using the Django framework

00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:58,680
it has a very modular design essentially

00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,870
one module per application and a flint

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,350
module is really just a Jenga app with

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,720
some extra fields and what a module

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,750
might do is just install the packages

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,660
using apt do some configuration

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:15,420
typically we try to use dev comp or

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:17,519
augeas for the configuration and also

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:21,630
provide basic service status and

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,529
configuration forms and then freedom

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:28,500
maker is our live image building tool it

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:30,120
uses vmd bootstrap but it has a a

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,810
customized script to set it up as a

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,930
freedombox

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,630
and also some hardware

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:38,120
shut up like to make sure that you boot

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:41,750
gets put in the right place of the disk

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,490
image and just want to talk about some

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:49,160
of the other packages that we that we

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:53,029
rely on throughout Debian so yeah I

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:56,600
guess the configuration tool avahi is

00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:57,740
the EM DNS server this allows you if you

00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,570
have a freedom bus running on your local

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,520
network you can typically type it open a

00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,770
web browser and just type in like

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,290
freedombox dot local and it'll take you

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:09,800
right to the box assuming the client

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:13,459
also supports mdns Serpa is the package

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,279
that handles let's encrypt h keeper

00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:19,850
we'll take the contents of slash UTC and

00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:22,370
check it into a git repository an easy

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:25,839
IP update is used for the dynamic DNS

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:29,500
module we have firewall D which is

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:33,290
really just a front-end to iptables

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,680
network manager ntp to set the date and

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:40,070
time on the box a snapper if you use the

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:42,620
butter FS file system you can use

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,150
snapper to create snapshots of the full

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,589
file system and also roll back to a

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:50,870
previous one open LDAP is used to store

00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:52,550
all the user information we're planning

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,709
to add a lot more fine-grained control

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:58,790
like which applications a certain user

00:11:54,709 --> 00:12:03,800
can access pagekite is another way to

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:05,630
get around like a NAT or firewall but it

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:11,420
only supports certain protocols like

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:14,390
HTTP or SSH tour I talked about already

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,520
and undefended upgrades basically will

00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,290
check every day to see if there's any

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:22,760
new package updates available and try to

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,630
install them so just talk about some

00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,920
ways you can help

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:30,410
as far as packaging since we only use

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,779
software in Debian you might notice a

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,270
lot of web apps are not packaged already

00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:37,700
so if you see a web app that you like

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,980
please consider packaging it we also

00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,790
have a page on the wiki called leaving

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,290
the cloud this is categorized with each

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,460
section refers to like a third party

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,130
service and there's

00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,560
a list of alternatives free software

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:55,960
that might be packaged to provide an

00:12:51,560 --> 00:13:00,860
alternative sheet to that service and

00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:02,300
then as far as package setup consider

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,450
things that would make it easier for

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,790
like an end-user to host a service so

00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:12,050
even things like including a system D

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:15,230
service file so to start the service and

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:18,770
then if you have a database consider

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,570
using doing the database setup in with

00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,880
the package configuration so there's a

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:26,360
package called DB convict common which

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,040
can handle that and really anything else

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,560
that might make it easier to host the

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:34,820
package a web server configuration

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,120
snippet for example and we also have a

00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,910
freedom box packaging team which is

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:45,010
mainly maintaining the core packages so

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:46,970
that I mentioned and then beyond that

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,610
people interested in freedom box will

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:52,160
also try to help out some patches to

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,510
other other packages that we use they're

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,590
typically maintained outside of this

00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:59,450
team and other teams so in other ways

00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,770
you could help the project the

00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:05,210
reproducible builds effort this link has

00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:07,250
basically the entire package set of

00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,220
freedom box and showing which ones are

00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:14,930
reproducible and which ones are not and

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,640
it should have also the bugs where you

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:23,390
can try to send patches to help with

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:24,560
that and then security hardening I don't

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,060
know too much about this topic but I

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,100
guess in systemd service files there are

00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,530
certain things you can add to limit the

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,150
privileges of the service so just

00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:35,780
consider doing that for different

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,730
services and then also a parmer is

00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,660
currently being discussed as a default

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:46,510
for debian so contributing profiles to

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,510
packages would also help

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:53,840
other ways to help hardware support like

00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,940
I said if Debian can run on a device

00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,160
then it can also be a freedom box so if

00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:01,090
you can get Debbie and running on more

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,100
devices that would certainly help us

00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,930
documentation the end user manual is on

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,890
the wiki so you can contribute to that

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:14,200
and then for translations we use this

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:17,210
web late service for translating plinth

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,220
but then also the the manual needs

00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:24,500
translations too and that's done on the

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:26,950
wiki okay I just want to talk about a

00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,950
couple

00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:13,019
that's okay all right

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,960
okay so one kind of big issue I want to

00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:24,200
talk about it deals with configuration

00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,000
of packages often we want to do some

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,170
configuration to set up a package for

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,380
use on freedombox

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,150
the problem is if if the configuration

00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:37,520
we want to modify is a conte file

00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:39,020
installed by by d package and then when

00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,870
you try to upgrade the package of course

00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,860
you got a kind of a prompt asking you

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,920
which one do you want to keep the old

00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,980
one or the new one so this this makes

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,970
unattended upgrades you know impossible

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,100
because it doesn't know which version to

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,110
keep and of course our users are not

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,730
technical they don't be technical skills

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,020
so they don't know which version to keep

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:02,150
either or they don't know how to merge

00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:04,160
together to get what they want so I

00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,170
guess one way that I've seen to work

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,180
around this is instead of shipping

00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,010
account file you generate the

00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:16,430
configuration in the post tense of the

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:17,060
package and then there's different ways

00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,010
to do this

00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,050
some people use UCF which can do like a

00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:25,610
three-way merge of the old old

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:27,980
figuration the new configuration but

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:30,380
ultimately it's we we do really need the

00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,660
maintainer to handle upgrading the

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:37,690
configuration to support the new version

00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:41,180
of the package and then also Deb Kampf

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,740
is very useful for us because it it's

00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,670
very easy for us to do configuration

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:49,040
that way and it also limits the the

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,570
kinds of changes that you might expect

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,820
in the configuration file so the

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:56,560
maintainer knows what to expect so they

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,560
can they can handle the upgrade that way

00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:06,020
so maybe some of you have other ideas on

00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:11,000
this topic that you can suggest some

00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:12,920
other things each one dimension backup

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,220
and restore is a big topic for us a big

00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,440
issue

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,690
I guess there's two different sides

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,640
there's the full system backup and then

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,500
backing up of individual application

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,690
data and then you really need both

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,690
because if if a user wants to migrate

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,250
from one hardware device to another they

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,880
want to just take their there

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:35,060
application data with them I don't have

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,770
any great solutions here but if it would

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,410
be nice if there was like a standard

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,720
Debian way to tell a package you know

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:45,100
produce a backup of your data or here's

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,100
a backup that I want you to restore

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:53,240
promoting blends just the idea is that

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,830
once you've installed Debian how do you

00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,780
find out about the blends that are

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:02,390
available so that's just something to

00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:04,760
think about and at one time I guess

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,790
there was an effort to to list all the

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,750
blends in the in the Debian installer

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,360
but I guess there were salsa some

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,410
problems to that approach so maybe think

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,070
about other ways to approach that

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:19,220
problem and I mentioned the live image

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,940
builds which are currently not using

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:25,940
Debian infrastructure so what would it

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:33,260
take to actually do live image builds

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:36,260
using the Debian infrastructure and then

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:39,320
also the plinth upstream development

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,240
currently is on github just mostly for

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,520
historical reasons that's kind of where

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,990
that project started but we would

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,690
actually like to move it off of github

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,430
to another place I know there is

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,770
discussion within Debian of either

00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:54,770
replacing Elliot or upgrading it to

00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,630
something new or more user friendly so

00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:03,550
we would definitely be interested in

00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:06,050
using that for plans as well and then

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:09,980
here are some links we have a landing

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:14,050
page at freedombox at work wiki on the

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:18,650
Debian wiki mailing list and IRC channel

00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:21,590
and I can also mention if you go to

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:25,739
freedombox dot work I should I real

00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:29,470
quick oops

00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:33,429
it has a link to download all the

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,749
current images live images here and it

00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:39,879
also has some links at the bottom to

00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:47,259
like the wiki page or the manual so you

00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:49,419
can navigate around that okay so that's

00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:55,200
pretty much all I had to talk about so

00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:55,200
are there any questions one in the back

00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:13,530
okay the questions that I have Nath's

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,530
I have a nice box of ways for disk

00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:19,710
enclosures however your sample page does

00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:33,179
not list any devices that can that can

00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:35,490
stop or two of hmm yeah so the question

00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:39,660
was about a nest box that had multiple

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:47,340
disk drives she doesn't run Debian or

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:49,740
can't run Debian I mean I would just try

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:55,340
installing Debian on it and then said

00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,340
install freedom box and see if it works

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,740
raid setup we don't have any specific

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,150
support for that so it would just be

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:07,559
whatever supported in the normal Debian

00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:15,480
install yes I'd like I'd like to repeat

00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:22,020
some questions from the IRC first are

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:27,900
there any plans to use nodejs nodejs the

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:30,240
programming language yeah if there was a

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,179
web application that used nodejs it

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,650
could certainly be supported main topic

00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:41,000
would be someone would have to package

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:46,080
the web application the second question

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:51,740
are there when we when and where will it

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,740
be possible to buy freedombox

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:57,270
I'm not like personally involved in

00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,970
trying to sell freedom boxes right now I

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:01,830
know the the freedombox Foundation had

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,390
talked about putting together like a

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,970
development kit and select make that

00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:09,410
available for sale as far as I know it's

00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,410
still really in the planning phase

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:35,180
thank you you and there are other slides

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:37,280
you have propagate plants what are you

00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:42,830
doing about this I try it before your

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:46,250
talk but I think it was not so no maybe

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:52,660
one book you wanted to propagate plants

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:52,660
I do on one of your slides future plans

00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:58,030
no no it was later whatever so you do

00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,330
you have said one item ones propagate

00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:07,240
plants understand that you wanted to

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:12,140
propagate plants

00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:20,480
promotes Debian plants are blonde okay

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:24,140
sir yes that was here yes how do you do

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,570
this it's not really just a habit for me

00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:31,610
but really for all of Debian I think and

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:33,350
all of debian blends especially I don't

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,700
have any specific approach to it was

00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,700
really just that idea to throw out there

00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:56,400
hello thanks for the presentation I have

00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,950
a question so it's supposed to be like a

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,780
server right supposed to be small so I

00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,760
have a question for example why there

00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,070
would be a need then for a network

00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,320
manager or an NTP if they can be easily

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,690
she like replaced with the existing

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,510
stuff that comes with debian like with

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:16,320
system D you know time should resolve

00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:23,520
the network D yeah and if you also

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:25,440
support Raspberry Pi 3 ok I mean if you

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,570
had if you have an approach to replace

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,070
network manager or something else or NTP

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,940
you something else we can certainly look

00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,780
at that suggestion

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,670
I haven't found them to be typically too

00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,620
much blow I mean compared to other

00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,690
things like the applications take up a

00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:43,920
lot more space I think then and these

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:47,490
services but and the our question was

00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:51,620
about Raspberry Pi 3 I'm working on

00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,620
building our live image to support that

00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,809
so in well the mic is running um let me

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,090
ask you said you have a lot of

00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:03,090
unpackaged web applications I don't know

00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:06,059
anything about web applications but she

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:08,780
seems to be pretty clever and he's doing

00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:11,580
this or working with this sandstorm

00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:15,200
project or company do you know anything

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:17,550
about sandstorm or intend to explore it

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,860
I've certainly been following the

00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,200
sandstorm project as well but the main

00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,940
difference I see is sandstorm uses

00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,780
things that are outside of Debian not

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:30,360
just things inside Debian right okay so

00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,340
you know would it make sense to support

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:37,890
sandstorm within a freedombox

00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:39,690
install tab a sandstorm I think that

00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,510
would be kind of outside the scope of

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,429
Frieda box itself but if someone wanted

00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,840
to create a derivative project that

00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:50,820
included sandstorm they could certainly

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:53,100
do that okay sorry regarding this still

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,809
regarding this the replacement like you

00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,110
that's that's why I was asking like the

00:26:54,809 --> 00:27:00,900
stuff which I mentioned the system Dena

00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:03,049
30 resolved the time soon they come with

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,119
Debian they come with systemd so

00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:07,249
you don't need Network manager and NTP

00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,980
whatsoever like at all so you just need

00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:12,350
to enable stuff which already is there

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,820
in Debian and everything will be working

00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,889
you will be getting the network network

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,799
time you will be getting the network of

00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:21,470
course there is no kind of hook or like

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,029
switching or like network interfaces or

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,590
stuff but since it's supposed to be a

00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:29,269
server it's supposed to have only one

00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:31,369
interface you're making a couple of

00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:33,529
interesting assumptions one of them is

00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:35,179
you're starting off saying gee isn't

00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:37,039
freedombox just supposed to be a server

00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:39,499
if the problem is well yes it's a server

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,119
but there's a lot of different ways it

00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:42,980
might be used there are some people who

00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,239
are primarily interested for example and

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,159
having something that sits in their

00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:47,330
house and provides a set of services and

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,279
in that case the network configuration

00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:51,470
is probably quite simple and and

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,090
reasonably static but there other people

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,820
that are very interested in taking these

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:58,549
and dropping them in places where some

00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,440
social action is happening and at that

00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:02,779
point all of a sudden the device might

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,749
be as much of a network client and need

00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:07,730
to have VPN configurations and things

00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:09,769
like that so there's an element of

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,690
generality that comes with things like

00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:12,889
network manager that aren't necessarily

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,440
there with some of the underlying

00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:16,609
replacements NTP is an example of

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,859
something I think you could have a long

00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:21,019
conversation about because as the former

00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:22,279
maintainer of the NTP stuff in Debian I

00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:23,720
learned that there are many different

00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:26,269
people who think very differently about

00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,710
how NTP should be configured where it

00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:30,169
should fit in the network startup

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:34,639
sequence and all of that the other thing

00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:36,950
I wanted to mention though is that all

00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:42,710
right I don't have connect

00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:44,870
I can eat it more Wow okay fine

00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,480
yes so the thing I was trying to suggest

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:49,760
is you have to be careful about being

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,440
too specific and what you think freedom

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,730
box is supposed to be in terms of where

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,169
it fits in the network because different

00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,090
people have very different ideas about

00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:57,769
how they want to use this and where it

00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,519
might fall in a network config and so

00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,529
forth

00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,539
a very reasonable configuration for

00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:04,639
example is to use it primarily as a way

00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:06,860
to have a probe oxi instance between

00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:09,139
your random clients that don't

00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:12,320
understand how to do privacy enhancing

00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:13,940
things and the rest of the net and so

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,919
you just you have to be careful when you

00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,510
say things like gee can't this be made

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,059
simpler the other thing I wanted to

00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:22,850
point out is that the work on freedombox

00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:24,620
predates the existence of system D so

00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,240
going G why aren't you just using all

00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,370
these things feel free to dive in and

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,919
help them update change and improve I'm

00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:34,010
sure they'd love the help Thanks fair

00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:35,659
enough I didn't see the other use key so

00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:39,169
this way but thanks for bringing this up

00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:40,760
just to continue on as far as freedom x

00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:45,049
being used in different contexts

00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:46,970
actually in these rural in villages in

00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:49,669
India they're setting up freedom boxes

00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:52,070
to sir to serve Wi-Fi to the entire

00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:54,679
village and then also hosts like music

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,940
streaming sites on the box I was hoping

00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:00,019
to show a picture of that but I didn't

00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:03,669
get one in time a few other questions

00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:03,669
from the IOC

00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:24,570
okay yeah if I put hidden box on my Cuba

00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:29,669
to Cuba trucker can it continue to be my

00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:32,640
miss miss TV back-end that is can you

00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:38,790
mix arbitrary Debian packages with

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:41,940
hidden box it's it depends like in some

00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,540
cases for example if you had a different

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,250
web server

00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,110
besides apache and you try to install

00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:49,679
apache on top of that there might be

00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:51,900
some conflicts there if you have some

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,270
technical skills you're you're acting as

00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,400
the administrator you can set your

00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:58,140
setting up the box then certainly I'm

00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,150
sure you could find a way to make them

00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,360
work side by side but that really

00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,650
depends on specifically your

00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:09,559
configuration and what you're doing with

00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:20,130
the box so not officially supported but

00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:22,980
you know what you're doing not the

00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:27,210
question but a comment solution for the

00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:32,040
backup issue have module developers make

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:39,690
their own backup and restore scripts you

00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:41,280
have module developers I assume the best

00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,440
person to do that is actually the

00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:47,340
package maintainer of the application

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,840
that we're talking about maybe some

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,840
people have other opinions on that

00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:05,240
I thanks for bringing this presentation

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:08,360
to us today I'm not sure time I had my

00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,760
eyes elsewhere in the room perhaps at

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,730
the moment but I think I missed if there

00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:17,740
is still own cloud or next cloud support

00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:20,809
was it dropped and why or is it well

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:24,020
yeah own cloud was dropped from Debian

00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:26,150
entirely so right and naturally we

00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,450
dropped it as well from from freedombox

00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:32,870
okay so you can install it okay yes so

00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:36,559
is is thinking sync thing going to

00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:38,900
replace the filing file sharing services

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,900
that own cloud or next cloud would have

00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:44,390
supported yeah I think it's a decent

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:46,549
replacement for that part the these file

00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:55,010
sharing and synchronization part okay

00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:59,750
thanks yes what happened to Sharlee the

00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:03,830
bookmark application that was also

00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:07,190
dropped from debian so it's not

00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:09,559
installable of course and stable I'm

00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:12,110
actually working on packaging packaging

00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:13,400
it in Debian again but really just going

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:17,120
through some of the dependencies right

00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:19,840
now I need to be packaged and also if

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,150
someone knows a good alternative to

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:26,090
Sharlee for writing the same kind of

00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:28,630
bookmarking service that would be good

00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,630
to look at as well

00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:48,190
like do you still support first

00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:50,950
provision of raspberry pi because I can

00:33:48,190 --> 00:34:01,150
see like the stable fashion image on

00:33:50,950 --> 00:34:04,990
your download site for the 0.9 I can see

00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:09,280
like ah you're talking about the

00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:11,530
original raspberry pi I had an issue of

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,690
building the image recently that's the

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,879
only reason that we haven't built it out

00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:20,010
there but I will say that one certainly

00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,010
does not use like Debian package kernel

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:33,730
so I yeah you might wanna consider good

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:39,099
so the own cloud question was actually

00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:41,260
quite a good example what impacts or

00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,790
what what how blends in Debian are

00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:47,740
actually related to the to the actual

00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:49,149
packages because if if if we all are or

00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:52,570
become a fan of freedombox

00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:54,310
and then we have a feature in stable and

00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,869
then that stable becomes old stable and

00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:58,150
suddenly the features some of the

00:34:55,869 --> 00:35:00,099
features are gone that's related to

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:05,560
actually package is not being maintained

00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:07,589
for some reason or another so especially

00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,180
with out loud the issue was that that

00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:12,910
include upstream refused to provide

00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:15,550
security patches for old version of ol

00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:19,510
cloud so but if we actually want to

00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:21,010
support a blend like freedom box we we

00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,050
as package maintainers have to keep our

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:26,020
packages in shape if it's used in Europe

00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:30,849
in your blend and then all is fine so

00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:33,160
also if we decide to drop a package we

00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:34,510
should consider and talk in sort of to

00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,869
myself and to people in the room here

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:40,690
that we actually become a bit more aware

00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:42,970
of where is my package actually used so

00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:46,420
and if you're talking about plans to

00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:49,630
actually make make a consumer product

00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:52,599
out of freedom box then this goes you

00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:55,960
know steps and steps further so yeah

00:35:52,599 --> 00:36:05,849
it's just blends are important in Debian

00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:05,849
I think behind you there's our question

00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,069
anything else

00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,359
okay if not we can wrap up here and I'll

00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:36,050
be around if anyone else wants to come

00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:36,050
