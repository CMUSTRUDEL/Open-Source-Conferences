	00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:12,629
good morning everyone this is a talk

00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:18,070
about experiences and lessons learned at

00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:19,900
in a local project that uses Debian at

00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,820
schools in Germany which lets me how

00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,369
much time which is the northern most

00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:28,089
northern country of Germany

00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:30,810
so before we start I'd like just to go

00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:35,829
around how many teachers are in the room

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,449
yay how many developers techies system

00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:40,600
administrator well developers first

00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:45,190
developers first okay technicians the

00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,769
system administrators okay okay so so

00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,160
this the story I'm telling you is maybe

00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:54,750
about all of you how many oh that's a

00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,750
good point how many parents aren't here

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,570
grandparents

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:03,429
ah good okay actually I forgot to raise

00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,250
my hand with the developers and the tech

00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:14,640
the techies so hmm

00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:14,640
I raise my hand then yes okay so okay

00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:28,380
okay so that's the official title of the

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:30,930
talk and so I mentioned the sharing I'm

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,960
really interested in what you have to

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,040
say not say maybe but right so please if

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,870
possible use the gobby so I'll be

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,310
talking about the project in Germany and

00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,800
the first question is actually Who am I

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,210
talking about who are we so that is our

00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:50,190
design we are a little group of people

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,430
actually including me and a local

00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:56,580
computer company and Keele including my

00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:01,190
wife actually and a clue including all

00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,190
the schools that we are working with and

00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:06,840
the the project set up is more like

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,209
we're not selling a product to the

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:17,160
schools but we're actually offering our

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:20,370
cooperation our support and so and and

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,760
and what we what we try to what we try

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,769
to achieve was actually not this normal

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,300
customer care first level second level

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:33,480
support but we actually try to achieve

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:35,850
on the one hand introduced free software

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,209
to the schools on the other hand be a

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,650
partner and also see them as a partner

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:50,370
so that there is a mutual learning

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:53,040
process process going on so this is the

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,840
first story actually coming in like in

00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:02,400
2011 we I was doing support for one for

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,380
one Club of Rome school in in Kiel and I

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,150
didn't know anything about what's going

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,920
on the Linux word really I was a Linux

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,470
system administrator by the time but I

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,340
did not really connect to communities at

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,530
that time so they asked me for help I

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,230
said yes I'm a freelancer I come in I

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:26,400
did it on my own I invented a really

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:28,049
complex setup and and then andreas who

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,340
is the guy from the computer company he

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,540
said well let's do something for other

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,090
schools because we have all these

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,260
schools

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,069
was coming in and they are asking

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,019
actually for how can we how can we do IT

00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,660
better than we used to do it other than

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:45,670
we're actually doing it now and and he

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,849
said and you've been doing this at the

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,170
Club of Rome schooling here so so what's

00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:53,200
what's your choice what's your idea and

00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,090
then I sat down and I didn't know what

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,370
to do otherwise I wrote a big concept

00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,610
actually a dick big document about how

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,930
to do IT at schools without having a

00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,500
clue about what I was writing about

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:09,700
actually so then it came to a point

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,260
where all IT teachers so the teachers at

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,230
a school that sort of feel responsible

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,600
for the idea at the school were gathered

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,250
together by one of the deputy

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,229
Headmaster's of school we were actually

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,380
wearing communication already with so I

00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:25,479
was sitting on Andreas and Angela too so

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,330
and raises the techie guy and Angela is

00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,789
more into communication we were sitting

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,419
in front of this group of IT teachers

00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:36,610
and proposing our idea with a you know

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:38,320
presentation with like 50 slides and

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,389
everything so it was freely overwhelming

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,590
and then there was this one teacher

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:47,169
saying why do you reinvent the wheel

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:49,120
why do you reinvent the wheel so there

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:52,900
are lots of solutions already available

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,099
and he just enumerated them so and then

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,840
we ducked down we left the room sort of

00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:01,389
we tried to rescue the situation but we

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,610
left the room and then Angela Reid took

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:05,560
us aside you did not look at what's

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,539
going on on the planet this is amazing

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,910
why didn't you do that so then we

00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:12,550
started looking at stuff so we looked at

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:18,840
stuff done by a company in Bremen that's

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:18,840
continued vention is my voice still

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:26,819
okay hello bedroom okay thank you

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,530
so we looked at what the innovation

00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:28,979
people do they have a UCS at school

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,169
thingy

00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,490
we looked at a different country county

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,159
in Germany which is baden-wÃ¼rttemberg

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,610
they have a they had a solution for

00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:43,889
schools at that time and we looked at

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:45,930
Debian 82 Scola Linux and that felt

00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,090
different because the others were doing

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,930
the county thing was just for the county

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,150
they didn't really plan to actually

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,340
promote it somewhere else the unis

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,810
vention product uses it school is really

00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,880
product and I try to install it three

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,340
times at that time that was 2011 ad work

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,810
so it's just the installation failed on

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,979
a local computer so I said okay this

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:11,940
could not be it may be and then I tried

00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:16,889
scholarly nooks and what I found

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:18,599
actually was a CD installer that

00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,759
provided me with the school server that

00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,069
was sort of working out of the box so

00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,229
actually only something that I was used

00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:31,919
from windows small business service at

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:33,509
the time so and then then Angela really

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,419
came in and she said okay this looks

00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,759
this feels like something you should do

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:40,199
we go there so we went to a place in

00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,080
Germany called kudos law which is my

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,479
birth term by the way and there is one

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,460
scholarly nose group and this scholarly

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,620
nose group handed me over to another

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,509
group which was in public and in

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,849
renowned files which is a different

00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:58,529
County and then they had a project going

00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:59,969
on for the whole county actually working

00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:01,380
on school readiness as a model solution

00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:03,029
for the whole county for all schools

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,719
with a lot of money involved everything

00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:09,840
and they're actually I met hoga hoga

00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:12,690
Leaf snows in the room and unis as well

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,810
and a couple of other DDS and people

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:18,960
attached to Debian somehow and its

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:23,819
really started to - well it started

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,800
making few cents so and at that time in

00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,719
that's project and run at first there

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,000
was a big issue actually why the project

00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:32,910
at the end people would say it actually

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,180
failed and the point was that

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:39,150
a lot of stuff get produced there but it

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,650
didn't get upstream to Debian so they

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,120
ended after three years with a different

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,270
package server with different software

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,830
on that that was an overlay for Debian

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:50,100
but the back streaming back up streaming

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,540
did not happen so so we came I came back

00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,600
from this meeting I said to Andrea's and

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:57,690
Angela if we do it we do it right so we

00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,280
need to do it sustainably we what one of

00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,460
us has to become a DD everyone was

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,370
pointing at me at that time and and we

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,680
work for the schools and what we do has

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,360
to end up in Debian so that we finally

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,120
can actually stop working on schools

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,500
school projects often stuff and then

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,070
it's still in Debian and hopefully

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,200
someone else takes over so have a large

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:27,390
context for our little little projecting

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:30,660
here so so far to the theory of doing

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:32,370
free software at schools but when we

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,919
started deploying it and then we started

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,380
actually you know getting involved with

00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:41,280
people with with teachers students

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,430
parents not so much sometimes teachers

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:48,150
teachers a lot of teachers actually and

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:51,120
and without turning this into a running

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,460
session we we were actually confronted

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,680
with the demand this is working at home

00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:01,920
why is it working at school so we really

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,080
needed to actually change our way of

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,230
being when getting in touch with the

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,830
people and the most important part was

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:14,790
not IT it was communication and it was

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:18,960
listening so and considering ourselves

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:23,810
as being partners not as much as imposes

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:27,510
visionaries free software advocates and

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:30,570
more like going going in touch with them

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:34,020
and actually really trying to get trying

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:37,620
to understand what they are what they

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,960
need what are the needs and what can we

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:45,170
provide and also be honest with that

00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,170
what can we not provide so

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:57,029
yeah I just go back because otherwise

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,800
this happens so the intersection becomes

00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:09,900
really really small if there is any at

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:12,029
all okay so I would I would also like to

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,520
mention that all this what we what we

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,260
did all the experiences we made would

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,730
not have been possible with such a great

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,370
community in the background as Debian

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,820
and also with the work of a few people

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:26,870
in the Debian edit project namely Holger

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:30,600
Wolfgang schwere also petr i notes and

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,980
what more more the legacy stuff because

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,170
he's not that active anymore at the

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:39,960
moment but responsive on questions very

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:45,210
good so we wouldn't be we wouldn't be

00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:48,390
there and what we also tried to be how

00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,339
we try to be actually was we did not

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,440
want to sell a product so there's

00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:55,350
there's a actually a competitive product

00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:59,070
in georgetown and in the counties in the

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,350
south of us it's called I serve and they

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,980
really they they shoot it in every

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:08,640
school and it's like mushrooms popping

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:12,060
up from the from the soil and it's a

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,040
it's very rigid way of providing the

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,089
system so so if you have a question if

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,630
you're at the school and you have a

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:18,209
demand

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,490
that's not complying with the with the

00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:25,040
default set up then there's virtually no

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:28,529
chance as far as I heard to actually

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,080
adapt the set up and that was something

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:35,040
as partners we understand ourselves as

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,990
as being able to actually modify what we

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,510
provide and that is actually very very

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:44,670
easily can be done very easily with

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:46,620
Debian edible scholarly nooks so just as

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,800
a reminder what Scala Linux is it's a

00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,750
main server its clients attached running

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,600
Debian its diskless clients attached

00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,900
running Debian its terminal servers that

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,670
you can attach and then you can run thin

00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:03,180
client stations we

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:05,850
actually extend the set up by wireless

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,250
in the school building elearning

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,900
software etc etc and every step that we

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,380
every every piece that we sort of

00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:18,510
develop I tried to actually upstream it

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:20,750
to Debian so let's come to the lessons

00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,750
learned

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:30,480
it's not about IT really not at all if

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,140
if the social setup is working well for

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,700
you then anything is possible it might

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,410
just take a bit of time it might just

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,520
take a bit of money but the main thing

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:44,130
is communication so and the main thing

00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,930
also is if communication goes wrong if

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,880
something goes wrong the space becomes

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:51,420
unclear clouded between people between

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,310
you and your customer / partner then

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,380
it's it's really important to clear up

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:58,710
the space immediately as soon as

00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:03,150
possible so get in touch and stay in the

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:07,190
flow of communication to be able to

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:10,800
communicate actually as a floss

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:12,780
enthusiast it's probably not that easy

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,180
for me sometimes it's not that easy

00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,750
actually but the best thing you can do

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,840
is listen

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:22,110
so really train your ears train your

00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,390
heart and get the people in try to

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,570
really understand what they run from you

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:32,130
and once you have that you can come with

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:33,720
the ideas slowly maybe but and maybe not

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,610
in the technical detail because that's

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,900
always overwhelming I have never seen a

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:41,580
situation where it is not and then do

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,140
the technical solution and then see if

00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,050
actually what they wanted is what they

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:55,260
got and check that early maybe during

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:57,900
the deployment what is also in the

00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:01,620
context of that is actually don't impose

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:04,320
don't demand but know your boundaries so

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,340
if you go to school and then you start

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,050
the whole thing with the free software

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,120
project and you want free software

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,640
because free software is what we need an

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,260
education it's not Chromebooks dumped

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,010
into schools like

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:19,170
for a couple of pens it's we want we

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:23,040
want students to actually be able to

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,870
choose the devices the operating systems

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,210
the software that they need the the way

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,090
of communication they want so we want to

00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:32,370
maybe provide the means for D clouding

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,550
people which is actually a nice word to

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,940
DQ loud people so so know your

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:41,880
boundaries but but don't impose and

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,960
don't don't be a missionary don't be a

00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,710
missionary though it doesn't make sense

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,660
it's I've done that a lot you know you

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,400
have to use free software and then they

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,080
tried and no it's broken and then it's

00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,430
actually the whole thing gets worse

00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,670
because they tried it and then it's

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,380
broken so so that's why we don't

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,110
actually do acquisition with all the

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,110
schools around us and you know tell them

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,300
about our project they find us we don't

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:09,360
have many customers but the customers we

00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:17,340
have are awesome and the corporation is

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:19,200
awesome and it really is fun so another

00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,110
thing is that we have one guy on our

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,540
team his name is Marcel and he is well

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,870
he's he's that an administrator no way

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,870
of saying it differently but he is he

00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:33,230
feels like a non techie person so that

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,400
is really really nice actually when

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,050
actually we have we have had massive

00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,000
that the schools that say oh can you

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:43,190
bring my cell can you bring hairs and oh

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,200
that's his name because he is such a

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,320
convenient nice way of being and you

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,150
know he's he's a really quiet guy and

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,380
and when he says something he really

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,230
brings it to the point and people

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,360
understand him so if you have if you but

00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,340
you shouldn't do that on your own anyway

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,060
so you need a team and if you have a

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:09,210
team a person like that is really it's

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:12,060
so valid so good so and and mostly those

00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,710
persons there's the staff people don't

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,840
go in depth when it comes to fixing bugs

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,730
or problems or packaging software that's

00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,220
not what they do but they they they

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:23,720
create a link between you and your

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,720
partner slash customer

00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:34,820
so also think long term or short term

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:37,760
so sometimes we we hear demand and maybe

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:43,280
people get angry at us but it vanishes

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:49,220
after two weeks so and it doesn't come

00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:51,320
back so on the other hand think about we

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,620
have release cycles and Debian so we

00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,300
need to actually enroll our customers in

00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,040
having and going with these release

00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,210
cycles we don't want to deploy an image

00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,150
and then they are stuck with that image

00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:05,660
so we want to actually create a flow

00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:08,150
regarding software upgrades regarding

00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,930
corporations regarding staff people so

00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:16,910
to really think long term and also act

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:20,240
short-term something we haven't achieved

00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:23,450
yet really but we need to do is involve

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,980
your team and Debian so that at the

00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,720
moment I am the main person that

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,720
actually interact with Debian so that is

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,110
not ideal so so we need to improve on

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,910
that

00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:37,310
and one important thing that we have

00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,920
experienced now the experience of second

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:44,840
time watch out for staff changes in the

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:46,640
schools so if you if there is a

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,930
headmaster change or deputy headmaster

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,810
change or the the ite afine people in

00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,110
the school if they change probably the

00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,370
whole situation changes and maybe also

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,620
it changes that you are not a customer

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:03,590
anymore so so be aware of that and

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,910
understands what's going on and be

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,830
prepared that you actually lose a

00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:10,190
customer when that such a change happens

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,990
because those those people in charge

00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,760
actually they already have been at other

00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,950
schools they have been doing IT they

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,120
have their solution there maybe in

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,800
Germany it's quite common that you

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,910
changed the school when you when you

00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,710
become promoted so yeah so and that's

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,790
fine they have their experience and they

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:32,780
want that of course for their school and

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:36,920
and and with with the teachers I have

00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,060
met only with some of them they actually

00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,620
really reacted

00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,840
no no we want to keep the set up or we

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,100
want free software it's more like well

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,460
yeah let's try something else if it

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:52,430
makes sense and I'll bring my Android to

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:58,400
more lessons anyway so so so yeah really

00:18:52,430 --> 00:19:03,020
be careful with that so we have one more

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:13,790
minute so any comments any remarks any

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:16,580
questions Mike please hi I'd like to ask

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:19,190
after the initial setup how many times

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,950
per year for example a school needs you

00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:25,580
and cause you to handle some stuff that

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:27,500
they cannot handle themselves so that

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,870
that differs actually we have one school

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,990
that that let us come in every week for

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:36,830
two hours we have another school that we

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:39,230
only play the fire engine fire where's

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,960
it fire people for so when something

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,360
fails really and that is like depending

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,760
on the reason sometimes it's the DSL

00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,130
provider some sometimes it's actually

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,700
that we have a disk failure so we try to

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,080
monitor that of course but also you

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,780
normally notice that immediately on the

00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:01,510
network so they called us in we have one

00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:04,600
school that is so in well it's actually

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:07,640
creating progress in our project that

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:11,000
schedules bigger project with us four

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,850
times five times a year like we work on

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,190
a school manager plugin for Gaza which

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:19,520
is the LDAP management front and so they

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:22,370
they actually did the incentive for that

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,780
then I package alias bullet for for

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,420
Debian which is an e-learning software

00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,070
so and they you know they drive they

00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:31,910
drive the project forward so it's really

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:35,750
really different and my recommendation

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:39,620
is actually if the school can afford it

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:43,640
and kill there is a model change so you

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:45,290
know like five years ago it was they had

00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,280
something going wrong with the sing or

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,700
the toilet and then they call the

00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,830
plumber yes sure but with the IT no way

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,419
and and there is there's

00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,120
paradigm shift at the moment that they

00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:58,640
say okay the toilet and the sing and the

00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,029
sockets and the wall electricity and the

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,039
computer it's it's all equipment so so

00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:08,960
we actually need to get some money for

00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:10,610
that and so so and if possible send

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,179
someone to the school on a regular basis

00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:17,690
and stay in touch and also as the

00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:20,419
project lead and the school head you

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:28,090
have a chat at least once a year maybe

00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:31,309
better twice a year all right welcome

00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:33,200
hey Sonia welcome to Montreal thanks so

00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:36,169
much for being here with us I'm very

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,169
excited in about learning more about ska

00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:41,870
Linux a quick question for you do you

00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:46,419
handle requests with a support tracker

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:48,769
yes we have OTRS if so do your customers

00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:50,600
handle that directly or they just call

00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:51,769
you email how do you handle this yeah

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,490
that's that's a good question actually

00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:58,490
because we wanted our customers to have

00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,710
as transparent access to our processes

00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:05,029
as possible so what we have is we have

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:07,730
ot RS tracking system and to one or two

00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:11,990
persons from each school have an account

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,460
as an agent which is a supporter on the

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,760
tracking systems so that they actually

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:18,649
can see everything that we see so that I

00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,779
mean let's sometimes a bit revealing and

00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:22,100
you cannot you know you cannot run about

00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:25,610
your customers led which is not

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,559
belonging there anyway so and and we

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:31,309
also need to train our staff members to

00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:34,220
actually not be afraid to put a comma in

00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:36,559
a ticket and say that says I didn't know

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,659
how to do that because I pick it up and

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,419
then I try to sort of help help our

00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:44,950
staff people because then you have to

00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:48,440
reveal your failures your incompetence

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:50,120
and and actually that is one of our big

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,029
principles we have in this project to

00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,830
not hide our stuff and it's it's derived

00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:57,799
from Debian in Debian we don't hide our

00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,630
mistakes either so and we have the

00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,950
tracking system and the customer and

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,460
that's we let them know let them know

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,460
anything

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:18,420
okay another question you stopped me

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:21,480
okay yeah one more question and then

00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:24,630
well just uh just a quick experience

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,390
sharing as a parent of four here in

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,790
Quebec province in Montreal I have two

00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,670
in elementary school in two in secondary

00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:36,360
school high school and basically in

00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:38,850
Quebec province there's a the the

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:42,300
schools are managed by a system of

00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:44,910
school boards that manage territories

00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,280
and it's a system that looks very much

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:49,620
like the municipal system with elected

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,220
officials and so on and I participated

00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:55,500
in school elections for school board

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:57,960
official two years ago I also was a

00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,760
volunteer for half a day or week during

00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,500
their whole year in elementary school

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,570
and it made me witness to all the

00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,640
problems that we have at least here in

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,590
Quebec we have a lot of people paid

00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,540
directly so that free software never

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,540
happens or it never gets close to the

00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,970
schools and we have a it's a worse

00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,860
situation than only having non free

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,940
software it's that now we have three

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:22,740
companies Microsoft Google and Apple

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:26,750
competing for space in the classrooms

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,190
with iPads Chromebooks and Microsoft 365

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,660
how do you address that is that even a

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,790
problem for you or do you see it's a

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,820
different situation in Europe then than

00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:38,790
what we have and in German schools the

00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:42,960
teachers have the right to choose their

00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:45,120
media equipment for learning so the

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,190
school PR the teachers and the parents

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,440
in the school conference if they say we

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,480
want to use free software then that's

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,270
the decision so it cannot be super

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,100
imposed by government or county

00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,780
government or so the decision is at the

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:02,580
school level it's at the school as it

00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:06,000
exactly we in September and this year we

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:08,250
have a meeting with an Institute part of

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,640
the county government watch time which

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:14,670
is basically taking responsibility for

00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,600
for quality assurance

00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:21,559
regarding meteor and IT usage at school

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:26,299
and these they got in touch with us by

00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:29,150
different story and they they they in

00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:33,220
this talk they said well we have we have

00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:36,590
IT providers working for us and then

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,630
it's like I don't want to name names but

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,299
it's like they they can sell you

00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,890
education price hardware and then they

00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:44,299
they see there's a demand to actually

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,950
set up the hardware in the school so

00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:48,350
they say yeah we can there too so they

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:51,830
sent someone and then they hand over the

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,240
setup back to this Institute and then

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,150
they realized that they have to actually

00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,590
fix loads of things so they are actually

00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,720
looking for someone that is really

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,490
involved in schools and IT and then they

00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,460
get in touch with us and they were a bit

00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,440
like feels like you have made up your

00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,030
mind about IT and schools that's

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,059
actually quite amazing

00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:14,539
we need to talk so and I'm quite curious

00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:17,150
what then what will come out of that one

00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:20,179
thing is that the the paradigm goes

00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:23,570
moves on from school server one per

00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:26,919
school user management per school and it

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:30,260
goes over to ID management on a

00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:32,390
municipality level or county level okay

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,100
so I'm here debconf

00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:37,220
addressed me if you have questions or

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,160
more feedback thanks for attending the

00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:45,130
talk

00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:45,130
