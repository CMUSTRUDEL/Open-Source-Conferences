[./play.it](https://wiki.debian.org/Games/PlayIt) is a libre software that automates the build of native packages for multiple distributions from [DRM-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) installers for commercial games. The generated packages are then installed using the standard tools provided by the distribution.

The purpose of this talk is to highlight this software that joined the Debian repositories with Debian Buster, providing a [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) tool to DRM-free game players who do not want to use one of the numerous all-in-one game clients. We probably will talk about DRM quite a bit too ;)

Our main target demographics are players, but this tool could be used by game developers too as a way to quickly generate packages for their games. [Contributions to ./play.it](https://forge.dotslashplay.it/play.it) are usually done by the players themselves, thanks to a syntax easy to grasp with no programming background.
