[./play.it](https://wiki.debian.org/Games/PlayIt) is a libre software that automates the build of native packages for multiple distributions from [DRM-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) installers for commercial games. The generated packages are then installed using the standard tools provided by the distribution.

The purpose of this talk is to highlight this software that joined the Debian repositories with Debian Buster, providing a [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) tool to DRM-free game players who do not want to use one of the numerous all-in-one game clients. We probably will talk about DRM quite a bit too ;)

Our main target demographics are players, but this tool could be used by game developers too as a way to quickly generate packages for their games. [Contributions to ./play.it](https://forge.dotslashplay.it/play.it) are usually done by the players themselves, thanks to a syntax easy to grasp with no programming background.

	                              welcome everyone to this short talk                               about plates                               a packages generator for drm free games                               that is provided in debian repositories                               since buster                               in the next dozen minutes or so we are                               going to present the software                               and talk a bit about drm issues                               this talk is going to cover four topics                                first we will present                                the team behind this talk and the larger                                one working on plate                                then we will explain what plate does and                                how to use it                                after that a more technical description                                will follow                                giving a quick description of its                                internals                                finally we will end with the place it                                has in the current video game landscape                                let's start with a short presentation of                                our team                                aunt vern hiding behind the nickname vv                                                                   is the original author and man developer                                of plate                                he started working on it as some                                short-lived exercise                                to learn the basics of software                                development half a dozen years ago                                and seeing as we're still here talking                                about it we can probably say that he                                slightly                                underestimated the ambition of such a                                software project                                while he had no prior knowledge in                                development when writing the first lines                                of played code                                he then found work in web development                                and linux system administration                                for a couple years he is now unemployed                                that is to say free to focus full time                                on plate development                                it is way past time to present myself                                i'm moppy i                                started to work on plagued about four                                years ago when i was beginning to study                                web development                                now i mostly focus on teaching be it web                                development                                the command line or linux and free                                software in general                                and i'm still working on play it some                                kids say i was tricked into it                                i was searching for some way to play on                                my laptop windows at the time                                i thought the hardware couldn't handle                                my games literally                                did i know it was actually the software                                once in linux coupled with plate                                my games went like a charm so i was                                hooked and played and i just had to                                continue working for it so i could add                                games i liked                                to the list of supported ones                                of course the play team is more than                                just the two of us                                in the last years a dozen contributors                                helped in various ways                                a couple of them are now regulars while                                some others only joined us for punctual                                contributions                                while our team is mostly a bunch of                                hobbyist developers who love video games                                but have no time to actually play any                                some of us help in other fields too like                                collecting games metadata to make our                                website a bit nicer                                sharing news about plate all over the                                internet or of course                                packaging it for multiple distributions                                now that you have a better idea of who                                we are let's have a look on plate itself                                starting but what it does and especially                                what it does not                                while a lot of software's especially                                ones related to gaming                                love to show off with a long list of                                features please development                                is very focused on a single task this                                means it is easy to differentiate it                                from                                other game related software by what it                                does                                not including downloading your games                                that is left to any tool you wish to use                                installing your game                                this is the role of your package manager                                actually launching your game you can do                                 that from any application you like                                 be it an applications menu or terminal                                 forcing you to update your game before                                 being able to play it                                 meaning you can play with no issue on an                                 offline computer                                 tracking you and your friends to show                                 each other who plays what                                 when and how                                 so what does plate actually do well                                 that's simple                                 it is focused on a single task                                 generating packages                                 plate can work on a collection of messy                                 dirty                                 half-broken gaming status and from them                                 it generates                                 nice and clean packages that are ready                                 to be fed to your packages manager                                 such packages can be built for several                                 distribution families                                 including debian arch linux and gen                                  as well as most of their derivatives                                 including                                 things like ubuntu linux might or                                 manjaro                                 this clear focus on a single task is one                                 of our core objectives                                 that are not going to change anytime                                 soon so you should not expect plate to                                 turn into a full featured games client                                 in the coming years                                 on the other hand this is thanks to this                                 chosen restriction                                 that it could be used as a building                                 block for some modular games management                                 system                                 feel free to reach us if you would like                                 to rely on plate to create your own                                 thing                                 around it we are willing to help such                                 projects                                 and to work with anyone trying to                                 improve the integration                                 of grm                                                 as you can see on the current slide                                 using plate is a very simple                                 operation that is designed to be doable                                 by people who do not feel at                                 ease when facing a common light prompt                                 the full installation process for a game                                 is actually a three-step one                                 played only taking care of one of the                                 steps                                 first you start by downloading a                                 supported game installer                                 from some drm free platform using your                                 web browser or                                 any tool that you are used to work with                                 second once your installer is downloaded                                 open a terminal and call the played                                 command                                 by giving it a single argument the path                                 to the game installer then wait a couple                                 of seconds                                 for a small game a couple minutes for a                                 big one                                 to let plate the time to do its magic                                 third when the packages are built plate                                 prints a command ready for you to copy                                 paste                                 to install set packages you can of                                 course                                 keep the packages instead and move them                                 to another computer                                 they are not specific to the system they                                 have been built                                 on after the packages installation the                                 game can be started from your money                                 applications exactly like you would if                                 it were coming from your distribution                                 repositories                                 going a bit more in depth we're going to                                 have a closer look at what makes plate                                 ticking                                 first of all plate does not do any                                 complex tasks by itself                                 following the kiss principle we rely on                                 specialized                                 third-party tools for operations like                                 data extractions from                                 archives or packages building from a                                 prepared directory                                 we only provide the glue allowing all                                 these tools to work together                                 so we have a library where all the                                 functions handling these third party                                 tools are set                                 and more generic functions providing a                                 higher level of abstraction to make all                                 of this                                 easier to use this library is designed                                 in a way to make it reasonable                                 by other projects even if as far as we                                 know this is not the case yet                                 relying on this library there is a                                 collection of game specific shell                                 scripts                                 this is where most of their day-to-day                                 work is focused                                 each script targets the support of one                                 single game                                 with a couple exceptions handling a                                 couple very similar game from a single                                 script                                 we will go a bit more on the details of                                 the game specific scripts in a minute or                                 two                                 let's see what happened during a                                 standard plate run so you have a better                                 idea of how                                 all of this works when you call play it                                 on a game archive                                 it starts by checking its integrity by                                 computing an                                 md                                                                      this is the only check that is done on                                 the game archive                                 and it can be skipped if you know what                                 you are doing                                 once we are sure that the archive is not                                 corrupted the game data is extracted                                 from it                                 this step rely on tools like lib archive                                 unzip or inno extract                                 from the game data the package's                                 structure is prepared                                 including game launchers and menu                                 entries with icons                                 the game launcher is a wrapper shell                                 script starting the game                                 using some third-party tool like dustbox                                 or wine when required                                 then the packages are built using tools                                 like dbkg                                 emerge for gain                                                          arch linux                                 once the building is done the                                 installation instructions are displaced                                 ready to be copy paste                                 the split between the library and game                                 specific scripts we                                 talked about earlier allows us to keep                                 all complex code                                 in a single place with the game scripts                                 only calling functions with a high level                                 of abstraction                                 to give an example a single function is                                 used to extract data                                 from game archives no matter the archive                                 format                                 likewise a single one is used to build                                 packages                                 not depending on the package format that                                 is requested by the user                                 this allows us to propose a structure                                 that is very easy to understand and                                 tweak                                 even by someone that never learned about                                 software development                                 usually a newcomer will spend an hour or                                 two on her first script                                 relying on some documentation and active                                 assets                                 then it can be done to a dozen minutes                                 for the second script                                 with a bit of experience it only takes a                                 couple minutes to add support for a new                                 game                                 improving the library on the other hand                                 may require a bit more knowledge on some                                 software development basics                                 but should not be required when your                                 objective is to add support for your                                 favorite games                                 this last part might be a bit more                                 political                                 as we are going to discuss drm spoiler                                 grm is evil                                 the main distinctive point of plate                                 compared to other tools                                 used to install games is that we only                                 allow                                 drm free games to be added to our

context                                 we can start with what wikipedia says                                 about it                                 digital rights management tools or

than that                                 is seen as a drm by plate any technical                                 measure artificially preventing you to                                 run a game in any way you want                                 or trying to lock you in a specific                                 vendor                                 this includes mandatory game clients as

treats you as a criminal and                                 actually entice you to act as one                                 this xkcd commit explained it quite well                                 thinking of buying from audible.com or                                 itunes                                 remember if you pirate something it's                                 yours for life                                 you can take it anywhere and it will                                 always work                                 but if you buy trm locked meteor and you                                 ever switch operating systems                                 or new technology comes along your                                 collection could be lost                                 and if you try to keep it you'll be a                                 criminal                                 so remember if you want a collection you                                 can count on                                 pirate it hey you'll be a criminal                                 either way                                 if you don't like this demand drm-free                                 files                                 of course a plate will win the way of                                 demanding jrm-free games                                 games that are locked behind jrm schemes                                 does not                                 even deserve the publicity we would do                                 them by pirating them                                 better to let them rot they are thought                                 as disposable goods                                 with an expiration date anyway                                 with that in mind you will never see a                                 game from one of the big                                 pro drm straws supported by plate                                 this

                       remember the definition we gave earlier                                 before trying to argue that there are                                 drm free games                                 on steam this is just an easy lie you                                 tell yourself                                 trying to rationalize your stockholm

                            and with the huge marketing force and                                 dirty psychological tricks                                 they actually managed to get loved by

required we cannot let them occupy                                 the full space otherwise it would be                                 facing                                 a bleak future full of

                              at the moment                                 so what is needed to add support for new                                 games                                 is it

                              the part about uh supporting new games                                 is uh something we try to                                 to make as easy as possible it's not                                 trivial of course but                                 we have lots of contributors who                                 have no prior development knowledge                                 and can still add support for new games                                 this is actually quite close to                                 writing a config file                                 you mostly write some metadata in a                                 script                                 copy past bits from                                 already existing scripts                                 you can expect to add support for a new                                 game in                                 one or two hours the first time                                 okay great we've got another question                                 which is                                 how many games are currently in the play                                 dot it library of supported games                                 uh it's a                                 good question i should be able to create                                 that                                 current version supports a bit more than                                                                     games                                 okay cool we've got another question                                 does play dot it work with games that                                 require                                 compatibility layers such as wine or is                                 it exclusive                                 to native games                                 yeah um something like                                 half our library                                 are native games but the other half                                 is a mix of wine games those box ones                                 some run with us convert too and                                 we use for some other games                                 dedicated engines like                                                                                      you use for kazakhstan                                 so so the rule here is                                 as long as we manage to run it at linux                                 it's okay to try to support it into                                 place                                 okay great uh i'll just give it another                                 minute or two in case anyone else has                                 any questions                                 so we just had another question coming                                 which is how long have you been working                                 on play.net                                 um it's a                                 tricky one because uh when i started                                 uh working on it it's the time i started                                 learning to use my tools too so                                 at some point i managed to                                 destroy all history or                                 all code history so i managed to                                 go as far back as roughly five years ago                                 and i think yeah it started around                                                                       okay we've got one final question um                                 is play.a good way to create packages                                 for the debian archive                                 or is it just for personal use no it's                                 not a good uh a good solution for the                                 then arcade for                                 two main reasons the first one is uh                                 we don't have source packages it's only                                 binary packages                                 and the second is that we                                 we do not want to                                 to kind of still work from the                                 former internet so play it                                 is not is not expected to support                                 any open source games so open source                                 engine with                                 non-free data is okay but something that                                 is                                 truly and fully open source                                 should be packaged using the standard                                 ways                                 not using plate                                 fantastic okay i'm afraid we've run out                                 of time for questions                                 and there are quite a few coming in the                                 pad so this does seem to have been a                                 very                                 a very popular and interesting talk um                                 but                                 we've got to uh switch we're going to                                 switch now to                                 a loop while we prepare for the next                                 talk which will be in about                                            time                                 thank you antoine and mo p for your talk                                 um it's available online so if anyone                                 wants to re-watch it                                 you can do so later as well thank you                                 very much                                 thank you                                 you
