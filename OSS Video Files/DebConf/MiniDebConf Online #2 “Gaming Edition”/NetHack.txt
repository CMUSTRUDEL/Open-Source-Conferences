In this talk I want to give an overview over the roguelike game NetHack.
Even though it is over 30 years old, it is still actively being developed and has an active community of players, with yearly tournaments and a bunch of friendly forks / variants.
I will show how to get started, what interfaces there are and where to find additional information about this quite complex game.
