Watching people discus a subject is a good way to learn about it. With this in mind, I decided that a visual novel would be a good way to get middle and high school students to learn about physics in a pleasant way. Instead of (or in addition to) answering questions about what they will do next, they can answer questions about the physics, to demonstrate that they understood it.

For writing visual novels, Ren'Py is the engine of choice. However, it has some drawbacks for this purpose. Most notably that as a teacher I want to monitor their progress. So I want to see their answers. That is not (reasonably) possible with Ren'Py. So I decided to write my own engine, which for now goes by the name "Lesverhaal".

In this talk, I'll explain the design of Lesverhaal, how I solved some problems and what problems are still left to solve. Spoiler: the main thing left to create is not code, but story content.

	                              hello                               so the next talk is on reswaral                               a visual novel engine for the use in the                               classroom centering                               by bus pass is the high school physics                               teacher who is very interested                               in the free software and hardware and                               writes code                               to solve problems so let's give it a                                listen                                hello my name is basswegnen and i will                                be talking about                                less val                                                                time                                so i'll get right into it                                less file is a visual novel engine with                                teacher supervision                                and i will be talking about what that                                means and                                why i made it i'll start by explaining                                what the problem is i'm trying to solve                                so traditionally in class students get                                theory                                and then at home they will be                                trying out the problems to see if they                                have understood                                the theory recently                                a well modern development has been to                                flip the classroom as called where the                                students will                                be getting theory at home using videos                                and then in class they will do the                                exercises                                which means that they can ask questions                                while they're doing it which is helpful                                however students are not very happy with                                that so                                it's actually better to do both in class                                and also at home                                so that's the idea and                                lesval is trying to do the home part so                                it's not                                meant to be used in class but at home                                and official novel is a really good tool                                for this because                                it's a game which is hopefully fun and                                it will also help i will explain                                how                                a visual novel tells a story using                                dialogue                                it has a background some characters are                                in front of it and                                they talk and that's the main way that                                information is given to the player                                i'll show an example of this the demo                                project                                from erienpai which                                looks like this                                so here you see a background                                with some text and when i                                continue then you can see the text                                changes obviously                                new scene new background and                                there's also a character here as you can                                see                                she appears using a fade effect                                now except for that there's also a                                question                                which is here so then this is a multiple                                choice question and i can                                choose what to answer so if i will ask                                her right away                                then she will actually ask me how class                                is and then                                the game continues now instead of                                doing a game that is just fun to                                to read and to experience of course i                                want to actually teach                                things so that it can be useful for                                homework so                                the idea is to add physics to the                                stories                                and the questions that will be asked                                should be                                well problems that they need to solve to                                show that they have understood the                                physics                                now if you want to make a visual novel                                the                                program of choice to use would be renpi                                yenpai is an engine that makes it really                                easy to make visual novels                                and so that's good because then the                                story writers can focus on their stories                                instead of                                how to make them uh also it runs on many                                platforms which is great                                because students obviously aren't all                                using the same platform                                 and if they are it was probably windows                                 and i'm not                                 really fond of uh supporting that myself                                 so if randby does that would be                                 very nice and it's it's mature so                                 it doesn't break all the time like                                 something that i would have written                                 myself                                 however there is also                                 a reason or there are several reasons                                 why not to use red pie for this                                 and the first reason which isn't all                                 that important because it can be done                                 is that open questions are not as easy                                 so                                 if you want to do something other than                                 multiple choice                                 questions then it will be a bit hard                                 in ganpai but it's not                                 not undoable and there's no reason to                                 write a complete alternative                                 the second point however is teacher                                 supervision is really hard                                 yanpai runs on the local computer and it                                 will                                 well if you really want to you could                                 store things on a file                                 but that's about it and then you would                                 have to tell your students to email the                                 file to you or something like that                                 which they will not be able to do                                 and also they need to install the                                 software                                 some of them will just pretend that they                                 couldn't do it and that there's                                 something wrong with the computer and                                 then now                                 they cannot make their homework and                                 they're really happy about it                                 and others actually do fail to do it                                 because they would want to do their                                 homework                                 and it's just it will not work even if                                 it's really easy as it is with randby                                 it will not work for everyone                                 so yeah that is an issue                                 which i want to solve and                                 finally i just like using software that                                 i wrote                                 so that's really not a good reason but                                 it is definitely a reason that i wrote                                 it                                 so that's why rimpa is not the best                                 choice in this case and so i made less                                 file                                 less for how also has a developer                                 interface that is similar to gampai                                 which means that it's really easy to to                                 make                                 games and you don't have to focus too                                 much on the                                 technical details so that's good                                 the questions can be generated that is                                 an important point                                 because that means that they don't have                                 to be the same for all students which                                 is nice if they want to copy each                                 other's work it doesn't work                                 which is good but also if a student has                                 trouble with with the questions they can                                 just do it again                                 and again and again and they get new                                 questions every time                                 so that's also a really nice feature                                 i made it so that the interface is                                 actually a web interface                                 so they only need to have a browser and                                 an internet connection                                 to be able to to use it which means it                                 will                                 just work for everyone it will even work                                 on their telephones                                 so that's really nice um of course i                                 made more question types                                 or more answer types i should really say                                 because i want to for example allow them                                 to do                                 a computation and then tell the answer                                 which is not multiple choice and all the                                 answers are of course                                 stored on the server because it is                                 running on a central server                                 and storing the answers is great because                                 that way                                 the teacher can see what how they did                                 and that is really important in order to                                 prepare for more                                 theory or maybe not if everyone already                                 understands it                                 so now let's have a look what it looks                                 like when                                 it does the same part of story as as the                                 demo project that we just saw in ganpai                                 so as you can see it looks the same                                 because i've just used the                                 the artwork from the again pi project                                 it just has text on the bottom same as                                 we've gone by                                 slightly different look but it's pretty                                 much the same thing                                 it changes scene abruptly because i                                 haven't                                 done any fade effect i also have not                                 done any fade effect                                 for the character so instead i am moving                                 her in from the side                                 and well the rest as you can see looks                                 very similar i get a question                                 which i can answer in multiple choice so                                 i do that                                 and now i have added something new which                                 is that i can                                 answer with a single line here                                 and i will say good which is the same as                                 the original and i answer                                 and then it just continues                                 um so it's uh it's very similar to                                 how rent buy works in in the interface                                 so what kinds of questions are supported                                 well multiple choice                                 obviously is the same that the empire                                 uses most of the time                                 single line meaning you can just answer                                 a single line it's an input element in                                 html                                 multi-line or text area element                                 and also any of the above but then with                                 a multi-line explanation so you can say                                 a single line answer but show how you                                 got your answer and that is a multi-line                                 block uh the reason i want to split it                                 up that way is                                 that i can then check the answer                                 programmatically but at the same time                                 i still want to see when i look back at                                 it                                 how they got there so that they can see                                 that they were doing the right thing or                                 maybe                                 the answer was wrong i can see that they                                 were actually doing the right thing but                                 they                                 they just made a tiny mistake so that's                                 also                                 interesting then there's a hidden                                 question which                                 the player will never see but it's just                                 a way to                                 add generated information                                 into the overview the teacher gets to                                 see                                 so if you have a generated question it                                 is interesting just to                                 to know what the actual question was for                                 example and                                 so the randomly generated parts                                 maybe you want to edit a hidden question                                 so that they will be stored                                 and then you know what question the                                 student was actually seeing                                 the answers that uh that are given                                 obviously the teacher can view all of                                 them                                 and actually the teacher can                                 see an overview of all students at once                                 and it's possible to change the it's                                 just a table and to change the style of                                 the cells in those table                                 in that in that table so that                                 you can see at a glance that most of the                                 questions were                                 answered correctly or not and where the                                 problems are                                 is it's all of the students or most of                                 the students that were having problems                                 with one question                                 is it most of the students did it right                                 but one question one student had                                 problems with                                 most questions those kinds of things are                                 really important                                 in order to to make sure you                                 do the right thing in class and so                                 that's really useful information to have                                 um so that is the the teacher interface                                 you can see all the all the information                                 um now what is the good thing about this                                 well first of all obviously the                                 homework can be nice it's a lot more fun                                 and i'm sure students will not call it                                 fun but                                 i think they do prefer it over just                                 dull problem solving                                 what is more important i think is that                                 the teacher can                                 can spot problems early                                 because it's easier to check all of the                                 students at once                                 normally when you say well you have this                                 homework and then you check a few                                 students                                 whether you do or maybe you check all of                                 them but then you don't check all of the                                 problems                                 and so                                 you don't get as much information from                                 just looking at                                 at their work on paper so that's really                                 good                                 um and if you want to you can show some                                 statistics in class so that students                                 know                                 how they are doing compared to the rest                                 without shaming the ones who are                                 at the bottom and also without                                 praising the ones at the top in case                                 they might not                                 want that to be known because that also                                 may happen that the rest of the class                                 will actually                                 give them problems for it so you can                                 make them make them know                                 their position without                                 telling any names which is also nice                                 so what to do in the future                                 um first of all i want a better user                                 interface                                 there is quite a bit of room for                                 improvement                                 especially also more animation                                 so i have some movement options but                                 grandpa has some some great things that                                 i don't have yet                                 like moving the entire screen or shaking                                 the screen                                 it's a great effect if you use it right                                 and                                 well at the moment let's file does not                                 support that                                 translations would be nice some other                                 answer type most specifically                                 multiple choice where you can select                                 multiple                                 answers would be a good one but also                                 maybe                                 things like making a drawing or                                 well there's a lot of a lot of options                                 now that's just programming and i can do                                 that but there's                                 also something i really cannot do i am                                 not an artist                                 and i will need backgrounds                                 sprites or character sprites music sound                                 effects                                 and maybe most important of all stories                                 because things need to be interesting to                                 play and                                 all of these i'm just not really good at                                 it                                 stories i can do a little maybe but                                 yeah the other is really not my thing                                 so if anyone is interested in helping                                 that would be very welcome                                 and it would also be fun i think                                 so if you are interested uh                                 please let me know send me an email                                 or first check out the code if you want                                 it's on github                                 i may want to move it to cells at some                                 point but right now it's there                                 so yeah you can check it out                                 if you want to see what it does                                 and that's it thank you for your                                 attention                                 and now i hope i will be able to take                                 questions uh                                 thanks was for the talk and                                 uh we have the ether pad and the irc                                 open for questions now                                 so till the time uh you put up the                                 question in the                                 ether part bas had some more stuff that                                 he needs to add                                 so bas you can                                 take the stage yeah thanks uh well i                                 don't really need to add it i                                 cut it because i wanted to leave room                                 for questions but                                 until they are coming i'm happy to talk                                 about                                 a thing that i'm                                 that i did in here which i'm i think i                                 did the right things but it's                                 interesting to talk about                                 which is that students may want to                                 make their own stories in this program                                 and so i allowed them to do that                                 but there's a pretty big problem with                                 that you can just upload files obviously                                 but the stories actually contain                                 python code which runs on the server so                                 that's a pretty big security issue                                 so what i did is that i                                 [Music]                                 i run a script in a crude environment                                 which takes the information on the                                 standard inputs                                 and then outputs the stuff on standard                                 out                                 the crude runs in a fire jail which                                 disables its network                                 so that the only thing you can really                                 still do from a script                                 is well bitcoin mining or something like                                 that                                 uh but there's also some limits on how                                 much uh how long it can run so that                                 hopefully won't work either so i think i                                 have a pretty good system set up that                                 that users can                                 can write their own stories and                                 they can play them and others can play                                 them without risking                                 security problems um so                                 yeah i really like that part as well so                                 uh                                 that's something that i uh i thought was                                 interesting to say                                 uh but i cut it out because of time but                                 uh                                 apparently there was still some time so                                 that's good um                                 so uh yeah that's uh that's about it for                                 now                                 so i'm not sure i don't see any                                 questions myself but                                 uh i see let's wait for a minute or so                                 so that if people have some additional                                 questions also                                 they can put up on the irc as well on                                 the ether pad                                 yeah yeah                                 [Music]                                 [Music]                                 uh so it's about time so                                 let's end this talk uh thanks buzz                                 for this talk and the insight you gave                                 about                                 uh your work and or back for the                                 direction                                 so see
