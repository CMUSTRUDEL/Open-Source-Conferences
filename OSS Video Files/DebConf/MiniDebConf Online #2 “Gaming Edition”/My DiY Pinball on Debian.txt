Debian gamers might already know "Emilia Pinball" which is in main since 2007 
and did not evolve much since and package was orphaned.

But this does not stop here !

During 2020 lock-down (first one) to get busy, I started to build my "Pincab" machine
to push the experience forward.

I'll explain the journey of this hobby project and how to replicate easily home 
on your favorite Debian or Yocto system using low cost materials.

Expect demos and track progress at:

Meanwhile you can play with extra community tables I published in main repos.
