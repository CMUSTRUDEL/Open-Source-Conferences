into a designer

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,720

communities in kerala

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,840
let's hear it out from him how

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,760
hey everyone my name is abraham raji and

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,800
i am a designer who uses foss tools for

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,039
his work

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,360
today in this talk i'd like to take you

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,440
through my journey as a designer

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,480
and discuss about some of the tools

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,000
that's available

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,799
in the force ecosystem for design so

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,439
my journey doesn't start long ago that

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,720
long ago

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,600
i mean it starts about 2018 my second

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,880
year

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,560
of my engineering degree so

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,240
me and a couple of my friends who were

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,119
also free software enthusiasts

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,920
like me started a small force club at

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,159
our college

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,320
and we used to conduct events from time

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,360
to time small event so we'd have

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,200
you know talks we'd have workshops

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,040
we'd sometimes have you know small

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,079
community meetups where we'd just hang

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,799
out and talk

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,920
about force and you know some cool tools

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,920
that we found out

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
so that was sort of the thing now these

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,479
for these events we had posters

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,159
so posters where you know we used to

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,799
make have these posters that we

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,439
you know at least we'd publish on you

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,960
know our social media accounts or

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,399
on you know all these groups on various

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,079
messaging platforms

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,240
and that's how people found out about

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,000
these uh meetups and these talks these

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,520
workshops and that's how people came to

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,280
our events

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,360
but things that we did not make these

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,200
events the we did not make these posters

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,200
these posters were made

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,800
by you know students who were designers

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,840
in our college who used to

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,480
design for other events like you know uh

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
design for other events essentially so

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,680
one what they

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,280
used is the adobe suite so they use

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,200
adobe suit for all their work

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,800
sometimes it's photoshop some sometimes

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,080
it's illustrator

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,280
and the fact that

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,680
you know an event that that i was

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,879
organizing for free software required

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,440
the use of all these you know propriety

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,680
tools

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,720
for for its success didn't really sit

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,360
well for me i mean

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
i have no issue in consuming things made

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,160
out of

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,920
propriety tools like you know i i watch

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,440
movies i listen to music and they're all

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,760
made out of proprietary tools

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,120
so that's not an issue for me but the

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,959
fact that i needed

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,120
these proprietary tools you know it's

00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,920
like it was that was the situation the

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,080
situation that

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,440
i needed these tools for the success of

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,080
a free software event

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,440
just didn't seem right to me so i went

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120
and you know i was close with some of

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,959
these designers so i've already talked

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
to them about you know freedom and

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,480
privacy

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,200
and understandably even though they

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,360
agreed with

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,400
you know the advantages of free software

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,239
they were

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,319
you know they they were they weren't

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,080
willing to make the switch because they

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,560
were worried about their productivity

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,040
and

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,400
that these tools may not have the exact

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,879
things that they needed

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,599
and very used to i mean i understood

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,239
that so

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,040
i didn't really push it much further so

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,200
instead

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,400
what i did was i just i thought why not

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,680
give it a try myself

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,280
and that's exactly what i did i started

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,920
by doing you know small

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,360
illustrations small poses for events

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,760
conducted by

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,239
the force club and that's how it started

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,920
and as time went by i started designing

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,080
for you know others you know people

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,519
started coming to me for small logos

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,920
more posters

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,599
this and that and i started doing work

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,720
for you know communities outside

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,959
colleges too

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,920
but even at this point i didn't think of

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,480
myself as

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,239
a designer i sort of more or less

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,519
thought of myself as a developer

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,879
software developer

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,359
who did designing on site and it

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,000
i kept thinking of myself that way up

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,639
until i

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,240
you know came across this person called

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,960
ragu

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,880
or a ragweed that's his full name so

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,440
people who know him call him regu

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
i you know first came across his website

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,400
then i had an

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,600
opportunity to interview him then you

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,840
know i had

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
more opportunities to speak with him and

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,639
he's a really nice dude

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,000
and more and the thing is that he's a

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,560
professional designer he has

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,919
done for work for very recognizable

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,639
brands in india

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,120
and you know he runs his own studio too

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,360
and

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,400
the cats is that he actually does all of

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,560
this

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,520
using exclusively free software tools

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,199
and that

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,120
at first when i came to know about that

00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,360
that really you know surprised me first

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,440
of

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,360
all someone who is in the so it is not

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,720
common for someone who is not a software

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,000
developer to care about

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,600
or you know be

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
enthusiastic about free software you

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,639
know that that was not very common and

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,479
on top of that

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,320
you know in anyone who is not a software

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,479
developer and even software developers

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,600
are intimidated by linux and the tools

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,680
that it offers

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,160
and for someone who is not a software

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,919
developer to actually spend time and you

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,400
know run an entire studio

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,199
all on himself without you know like an

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,720
id

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,680
support from someone you know it was

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,240
very impressive

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,199
and that he did what he did and that

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,960
really you know

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,880
changed my perspective on this thing

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,880
that you know i started to see these

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,840
tools as actual professional tools and i

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,360
started to

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,400
expect more from these tools i started

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,960
attempting more

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,000
in a complex design so i started you

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,320
know trying

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,080
more and more stuff with these tools and

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,000
that the change was evident

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,160
in my work and within a few months

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
you know people started to actually you

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,680
know you know

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,680
show interest in hiring me as you know a

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,440
freelance designer as a part-time

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
designer and i got more and more

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,720
opportunity to work paid

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,639
and i have worked on you know community

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,639
projects like pete community projects

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,280
i've got the opportunity to work on

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,560
government projects and more

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,520
and to think that all this was possible

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,000
simply because

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,919
you know i didn't want to use an adobe i

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,639
didn't want to use adobe suit

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,400
and i loved free software i mean i i

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,199
never expected this to be honest it's

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,400
sort of

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,440
it's still somewhat of a dream for me

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,520
and i still don't get how

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,360
i came up i came to this it's sometimes

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,120
i think it's sheer luck

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,919
but essentially my love for free

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,960
software turned me into a designer

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,680
yeah so that is my story

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,000
and uh here's a few uh designs that i've

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,960
done so these are all for communities

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
this is all these are stuff i've done

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,560
for community so

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
various communities uh the final one is

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,400
the call for proposal

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,080
poster that i've done for this very you

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,199
know conference and this is what i'm

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,840
capable of doing

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,280
right now with inkscape and inkscape is

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,680
my you know

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,680
tour of choice so that being said

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
you know there are many tools and i'd

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,080
like to talk to you about a few tools

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,599
and you had

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,440
like to start with things skip so

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,199
inkscapes vector graphics too

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,960
you know inkscape is very it's it's very

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,599
simple when you look at it at first but

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,039
then

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,599
there are some advanced stuff that you

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,240
can do it and you but you have to really

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,280
you know

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,599
put effort into learning thing you know

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,720
the escape developers try to making skip

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,120
very simple for

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,919
you know star users who are starting out

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,840
so they don't

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,360
they try not to intimidate them but

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
there are very advanced features that

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,160
you can

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,000
uh do it do with it and one thing i

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,879
really love about inkscape is that the

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,919
base file format for escape is svg

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,240
so essentially if you use you know if

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,360
you

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,280
have a file that is dot ai or dot psd

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,720
if you want it to you know render

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,479
properly hundred percent of the time

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,879
your best option is to open it via

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,160
photoshop or illustrator

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,840
but for svg you can pretty much operate

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,039
in a browser or a text editor

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,080
even if you choose to so like you don't

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,160
need inkscape

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,680
to you know open an svg file that is

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,400
produced by inkscape

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,120
and you can do so essentially if i am in

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,599
a team

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,360
not everyone has to use inkscape i

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,519
everyone just needs to use a tool that

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,360
supports svg i think that is wonderful

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,519
and that is the kind of direction

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,279
you know these tools needs to go so i

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,080
really love inkscape for that and

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,800
inkscape

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,720
sort of fits well for my style of design

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,399
i mostly use vectors and there are very

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,680
flat designs so

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,000
inkscape is really the tool of my choice

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,959
nexus is something that

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
everyone

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,080
has to use at some point or rather if

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,160
they're using false

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,279
tools for design it's basic image

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,600
manipulation

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,519
and has a lot of advanced features

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,640
too and it is getting powerful day by

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,560
day

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,240
with every release it is very well made

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,120
it's one of the oldest projects out

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,440
there so

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,240
you know it's it you can say the fact

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,080
that it's still

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
active means that it is very well

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,680
maintained so

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,600
 is something you know that everyone

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,080
should try out and even if you're not an

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,160
artist

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,720
like i recently came to know that people

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,000
use in a game for automating image

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,760
processing so sometimes

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
you need so there's a large set of

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,399
images like thousands of images and you

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
need to

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,000
you you want to make them or you know

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,560
grayscale or you want

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,920
them or resize them to a particular size

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,440
for maybe you know

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,600
training a machine learning model or

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,640
something what people do is people use

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,959
 to automate and script the kind of

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,560
you know transformations they want to

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,399
apply on the images and

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,399
gim just does that and they do this on

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,959
thousands and thousands of images

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,080
and is what they use and this is

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,080
sort of the beauty of

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,279
 being an open source free and open

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,079
source tool

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,640
and i don't think we would be able to

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,800
give

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,560
a you know i don't think it will be it

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,640
would have been able to do it if

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,200
wasn't afraid open source too

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,320
and this is sort of why we need more

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,079
force tools in

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,279
this sort of area so yeah that's

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,920
next is krita so krita is what

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,760
you use if you're into digital art if

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
you want to draw if you like

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,360
making little art kara is what you

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,519
should go so even

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,279
so if you go to youtube and if you look

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,640
at all the reviews and comparisons

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,680
between things like krita and

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,839
illustrator

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,800
people definitely feel that krita is

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,519
very powerful

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,640
and is very you know put it has a lot of

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,360
potential

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,399
in fact a lot of people actually say

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,560
that you know they've

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,760
a lot of good switch from photoshoot to

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,839
shop to

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,680
krita and in illustrator to critter

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,640
because it's very you know it's it's a

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,959
much better it's

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,200
they find that it is almost a much

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,120
better deal for them because it offers

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,600
almost all the features that they need

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,480
and

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
it's free and you know they can extend

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,839
it

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,440
to fit their kind of workflow in fact i

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,440
think gregory

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,680
regu said somewhere that you know he had

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,920
a after using krita for years when he

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,680
went back to photoshop he felt that

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,079
you know the user experience was pretty

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,760
bad and he actually really

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,680
felt that the critters advanced

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,800
workflows actually spoiled

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,040
the spoiled photoshop for him

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,800
so yeah that's how good cutter is so if

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,040
you are into digital art i should

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,160
definitely take a look at cutter

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,399
next is pencil so this is a

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,360
tool for ui ux and prototyping and this

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,160
is where

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,040
the force ecosystem is still sort of

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,440
lacking

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,320
in so the thing is that pencil is the

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,680
only tool

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,040
for ui ux and prototyping that i found

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,880
that had a stable release there are

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,880
other upcoming tools but they are still

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,839
there alpha stage so for example

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,279
stuff like um akira then there's pen

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,079
port then there is

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,720
quant there some of them are web based

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,360
some of them

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,079
actually have a desktop client uh

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,160
actually you know

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,440
official desktop line so the thing is

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,480
that they are

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,720
upcoming there is no uh pencil in itself

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,480
you know without the community tools

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,079
with the without the community plugins

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,720
it's very bare bones

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,279
and the design or ui elements that it

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,079
has it

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,680
is outdated but you can definitely use

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,639
the community plugins and make it more

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,360
usable

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,959
but still a pencil it has a really good

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,399
user experience and it is definitely

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,160
usable but without the community

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,959
plug-ins it's pretty outdated and the

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,399
reason for that

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:41,839
is that uh principle is made by a

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,639
company a company with a force company

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,839
called evolve us it's vietnamese it's a

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,800
vietnamese company

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,000
so they develop pencil when they're not

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
working on other projects

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,519
so that's how pencil is being made and

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,680
because of that

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,720
you know pencils development process is

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,040
very slow but

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,240
they still are active but slow that's

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,360
what how it is

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,519
for pencil but you know it's something

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,920
better than nothing i guess

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,959
so pencil is pretty good and you can use

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,959
it for ui ux

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,320
but me personally i still stick to

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,720
inkscape because

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,040
i sort of like inkscape and i'm somewhat

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,959
partial towards it it is very inkscaped

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,079
is definitely a very powerful tool to be

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,800
honest

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,440
so these are tools that i wanted to you

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,720
know

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,800
talk about and i hope you know in the

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,959
years to come we have more tools and the

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,880
existing tools will become more powerful

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,880
so if you're a software developer you

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,160
like running system software or you know

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,959
this kind of software you should

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,680
definitely

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,199
you know try and invest your time into

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,279
creating something for ui ux and

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,279
prototype because there's definitely

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,440
you know nothing out there not nothing

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,720
there's definitely a lot of space for a

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,199
false ui ux

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,360
and prototyping tool and you know you

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,800
should definitely exploit it

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,560
and that's about it to be honest uh

00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,839
so thanks for listening to me i'd like

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,800
to conclude this talk

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,760
by saying that you know we should

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,680
definitely

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,720
try and you know contribute back to

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,160
you know free software tools outside the

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,560
developer ecosystem

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160
in the sense it is more or less kind of

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,839
easy to you know

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,079
leave off hundred percent free and open

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,480
source tools if you're a developer but

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,760
if you are an artist or a music producer

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,680
or a doctor

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,839
it's not that easy it's somewhat you

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,480
know very difficult or somewhat

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,839
impossible to be honest so if we really

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,880
want the you know

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,120
the year of the linux desktop to come we

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,120
need to start investing in those areas

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,560
too so that is something that i want to

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,120
tell you people and for those designers

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,160
who are still contemplating on moving to

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,240
something like

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,040
or inkscape from photoshop or

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,959
illustrator or any of the adobe suit

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,240
if i can do it you guys can do it

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,480
because i am not

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,920
you know like i'm not someone who really

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,399
pursues designing

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,839
as a professional even i do it i started

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,920
as a hobby and

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,040
you know i just do it even today as a

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,639
hobby but you know

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,160
opportunities came to me but if you're

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,639
someone who is serious about it you can

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,760
definitely get ahead a lot

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,680
more than i have done so yeah if i can

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,360
do it you can do it too

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,600
and we should definitely popularize and

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,279
normalize the use of these software more

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,040
you know tools like this that are made

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,519
with love are so

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,839
important and they're so special and we

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,759
should definitely have more of those

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,079
and i um and i seriously get mind blown

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,920
every time i see someone do something

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,560
awesome with these tools and i was like

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,120
oh these

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,560
you could do this too so yeah i think

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,000
these tools are very important

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,320
these tools that are not you know

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,079
blocked behind huge bay walls

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,920
that you know respect everyone's freedom

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,199
and privacy i think these are very

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,360
important

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,199
so yeah so now uh you guys can ask me

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
you know any questions that you have in

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,180
the thought pad

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:06,179
for q and a session thank you

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:06,179
[Music]

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,440
hello so thanks abraham for the

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,560
wonderful talk

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,839
so let's move forward with the

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:21,440
q a session so on pad

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,600
i see there is a question by rrs

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,120
so abraham rrs asked in the context of

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,279
the indian market

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,199
what would be the optimum hardware to

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,320
run creta

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,320
i have he says i have been wondering if

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,959
these tools but creta in particular

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,440
could be used in a tablet device

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,680
and does it support android tablet any

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,720
recommendation for the hardware

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,279
so abraham so

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,000
as far as hardware for any design tool

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,120
goes

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,800
right now um any kind of processor

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,880
that's like above

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,199
a celeron i3 works i5 works and i5 is

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,560
a sweet spot in in the context of the

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,600
indian market right now

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,400
because it's kind of a but it's you can

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,160
it's available in budget as well as in

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,319
somewhat higher range devices

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,280
so i5 as a processor and at least four

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,360
gigs of ram

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,720
because you know obvious reasons and

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,199
eight gigs is

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,640
recommended but four gigs will work too

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,760
and those are really the only two

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,160
requirements

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,360
if you if i say so then as far as

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,559
hardware support goes

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,480
um uh for krita since i don't use krita

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
a lot i am not really sure about the

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,720
hardware requirement i mean

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,880
the hardware support for tablets but i'm

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,679
aware that there's a documentation of

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,160
uh in the in krita's website with the

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,240
list of all the devices that's supported

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,320
so if you are looking for purchasing

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,679
options you it would be best if you go

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
through the website and

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,120
go through the list of devices that are

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,559
officially supported

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,039
yeah that answers it uh so let's

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,760
move to the next question so the next

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,120
question

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,520
is by couple hp who says

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,720
what programming language can one use to

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,720
script krita

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:13,600
or inkscape and he says that he knows

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:16,880
python works with so abraham

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,280
yeah python works for uh krita too

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,480
uh you can just import krita you know

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,880
for uh

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,640
from the whole thing you know it works

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,480
python works for critter too

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,480
then as far as inkscape is concerned

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,480
inkscape you know like i said in the

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,440
video primarily deals with svgs

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,320
and svg's follow this xml format so any

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,960
programming language that sort of works

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,000
you know in manipulating the xml format

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,559
you can use it to

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,440
do stuff with inkscape and then i've

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,160
seen people use d3 javascript d3

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,160
for uh doing stuff within skip and that

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,799
is something that i haven't really tried

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,880
but

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,960
i know that anything that you know has a

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,720
library for xml you know you can make

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,200
stuff work with inkscape

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,360
so yeah i mean python works definitely

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,960
python works for all three

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,240
yeah python works for a lot of things

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,440
so we it's about time and thank you

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,240
abraham for

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,360
the amazing talk and more so about the q

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,559
a part

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:25,840
so let's end the talk now so

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,840
see ya good day

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
