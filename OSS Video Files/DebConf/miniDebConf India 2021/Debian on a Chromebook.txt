The speaker installed Debian on his Asus Chromebook Flip C100PA. This talk will:

- Give details on how this was done.
- Highlight some lessons learnt along the way.
- Explain how parts of the procedure can be used for other Chromebooks.

Chromebooks are devices with a version of GNU/Linux pre-installed. The open source version of what has been installed is available for building on one's own. The ChromeOS team also makes efforts to get their patches to the software used (especially the kernel) "upstreamed". Hence, these devices are often good cheap hardware on which to run Debian. Audience would be anyone who wants to run Debian on their Chromebook.
