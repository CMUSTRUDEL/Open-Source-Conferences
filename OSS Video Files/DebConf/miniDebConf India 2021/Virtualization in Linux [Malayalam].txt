A small introduction to Linux virtualization for beginners who are migrating from other proprietary OSes in Malayalam. My focus of the tool is Linux KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine).

This includes guides to install and set up KVM in a Debian system and to create a virtual machine and pass-through some hardware to it. So users can experience near native performance on virtual machine. I hope this helps some new users to migrate to FOSS keeping their old dependencies as it is on a virtual machine. Eventually find better alternatives.
