Wikidata is a free and open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines. Wikidata acts as central storage for the structured data of its Wikimedia sister projects including Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wiktionary, Wikisource, and others. Wikidata also hosts datamodel for A number of entities. I will try to provide and introduction to the internals of Wikidata and how to contribute. (https://www.wikidata.org/)

Abstract wikipedia is the latest project announced by Wikimedia foundation. This aim of this project is the develop human readable text from the data available in Wikidata with the help of Lexicographical data available in Wikidata. The project is now in early stages and I will try to give an overview of the project. (https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wikipedia)
