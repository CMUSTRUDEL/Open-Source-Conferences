the debian project is independent and

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,879
run by its community members

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,760
the debian new linux operating system is

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,879
a collection of free software packages

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,000

more about debian

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,080
on the debian website or on wikipedia

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,120
what is debconf capcom is an animal

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,599
conference

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
where debian contributors get together

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,519
to work on debian

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,400
it usually happens in person although in

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,720
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,879
we held it as an online event due to the

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,599
kobach 19 pandemic

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:46,959
in 2023 tabconf is coming to india

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,239
what is a minidub conf a mini devconf

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,319
is similar to dubcon but more localized

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,000
and these types of events can happen

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,080
throughout the year

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,599
previous mini dub conf in india was in

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,840
2016.

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,879
we also conduct double cells and valley

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,360
which are usually

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,040
held at various educational institutions

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,560
across india

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,440
in 2020 debian team find our first

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,840
online minitab conf and this is our

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,720
first

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,120
online mini dupont in india as physical

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,760
gatherings are nearly impossible

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,879
and hence we could pull audience from

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,159
all over the world

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,560
and this became more than a local event

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,040
talking more about the event this was

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,920
planned and coordinated by shruti

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,000
right after dubcon 20 which was a great

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,480
success as an online event

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,319
and for us we were so glad to have a

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,640
malayalam track in depconf

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,239
for the first time and all of us could

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,159
be part of it

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,799
then we discussed and came up with a

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,200
proposal to include more languages from

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
india in our minidub conf as there are

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,799
debian lovers

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,560
all across the country and thus a

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,120
multilingual minidupcon

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,680
is happening today we started our

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,599
primary discussions in november

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,840
and had weekly meetings with the team

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,280
and many joined and gave us support in

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,120
various ways

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,959
with all the support and love from the

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,040

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,400
as well as debian community around the

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,599
