emac since about

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,320
2008 i changed over to vim in between

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,360
and stayed with it for about 10 years or

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,960

or do by uh i'm buddy

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,439
hi everyone my name is somebody uh i'm

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,360
working as a web developer

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,759
um i also help companies to switch to

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,520
gnu linux

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,840
i am a free member of free software

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,840
community of india

00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,239
[Music]

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,239
i became more and more invested in the

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,040
facebook philosophy

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,520
and that back then i was using uh views

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,280
and

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,280
i think you know about all the things

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,920
that you know was working behind the

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
escort

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,599
and i don't want to be part of that

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
ecosystem so i start searching for

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,000
things

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that were an alternative that you know

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,920
that should be that is

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,599
actually you know very close to the

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
peace of capital

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,879
and you know i went through a lot of you

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,640
know open source sectors

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,640
and uh software technologies

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,319
for one and a half years for about one

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,760
and a half years i

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,319
use my own configuration and about six

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
months ago

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,319
both have been really like uh the reason

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,720
i went through the moving message

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,720
because

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,680
the best thing about emacs is the

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,799
extensibility and the freedom the user

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,680
gets

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,440
with their uh you know respect and or

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,159
you can obviously do all these wonderful

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,920
things

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,440
and that is a list of and if i start

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,239
talking about that the entire

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,879
viewers won't give me so yeah hopefully

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,879
you can read it

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,200
okay then i guess i'll talk about why i

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,239
switched to emacs

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,040
first i was a programmer since school

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,080
days

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,519
i was very interested in programming i

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,959
mean i started

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,760
at about fourth grade and i continued

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,720
to about my 12th grade on windows

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,400
program

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,160
programming and visual music and c plus

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,639
plus but i found it really

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,199
weak platform for doing that uh don't

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,759
get angry

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,680
at me for saying that but that was my

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
experience i mean windows was not that

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,120
easy

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
to program with so then i uh switched

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,639
over to

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,440
linux by the time i was in college

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,080
entirely

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,960
and one of the biggest changes that i

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,160
made to my workflow was to go for a

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,520
uh go for an editor rather than an id

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,560
uh in those days uh this view was

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,560
very prevalent that ids are uh not as

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,840
powerful as editors and

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,040
obviously there were two choices rim and

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,720
dmax i

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,120
started using again in around 2008

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,759
i really liked emacs it's very

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,960
consistent

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,320
it has so much extensibility i could

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,080
just

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,400
modify it in a way that i wanted it to

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,520
be i mean even today it is exactly what

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,520
i want it to be not

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,440
some what someone else wanted wants it

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,199
to be for me

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,320
uh but eventually i found vim

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,160
i just tried it uh i wanted to see the

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,560
uh i wanted to see what was so great

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,600
about its uh key bindings the

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,400
favorite or the famous vip bindings i

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,440
was

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,000
so struck by it i so uh

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,600
you know struck by uh bim that i

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,880
switched over to bim from

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,680
that day onwards but not without much

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,720
reluctance

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,440
i had to give up a lot on emacs uh when

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,600
i found

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,800
vik bindings but vip bindings were

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,400
really really important

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,039
i stayed with again vm for a long time

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,120
and eventually i discovered evil evil

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,280
keyboard bindings so

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,960
evil key bindings allow you to use the

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,800
same key bindings as in bim

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,479
in emacs but at the same time you will

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,840
be able to use the extensibility of

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,080
emacs

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,600
and that way uh i made my switch

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,880
entirely to emax uh

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,160
now i'm a i'm a vm ad

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,720
emacs user and the reasons why i stay on

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,160
uh is small is the same as everybody

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,880
else and it's the same as what uh

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,680
abraham was

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,960
just explaining it's the extensibility

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,639
it's the

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,160
it's my command center it's where i

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,160
control my entire computer from

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,800
all right uh i'm buddy it's up to you

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,080
okay uh talking about my story uh

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,800
before i was introduced to the free

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,919
software philosophy you know i was using

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,199
sublime text victor um you know the

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,759
sleek look and

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,599
it really changed the way uh how people

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,280
used to see an id

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,919
uh then once i learned about the

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,840
importance of free software and all um i

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,840
started with the art editor

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,319
actually it was going very well for a

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,800
short amount of time but

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,800
soon i was not able to use it properly

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,319
due to its over ram usage then

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,360
i started checking for other ids

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,110
with free software license of course

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,280
and that's when i found out emacs

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,440
[Music]

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,599
starting with emacs in its landlord mode

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,160
it was not that easy

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,240
i you know it is not easy to spend a lot

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,000
of time to

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,919
learn any id when you have a lot of work

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,680
to do so i started with

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,440
space max and i was happy with it uh

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,400
it's been about three years since i

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,000
switched to space max

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,319
you know the helm and the default

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,879
a lot of extension space max provides

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,160
which makes it easy to

00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:00,319
which makes easy to you know work with

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,039
or make it as an ide um

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,919
then it's been about two months since i

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,720
switched to van life max

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,280
even before i tried a couple of times

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,280
but

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,400
it was a miserable failure i mean i mean

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,800
choosing to vandalize

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,919
was not that easy you have to spend some

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,039
time

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:24,080
uh to make it work as you want

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,400
right when i got used to

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,520
configuring emacs i got ping finger

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,479
syndrome uh

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,360
it's not a joke uh it's called

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,839
neuropathy it affects your pinky finger

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,000
uh but you know once you

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,680
get used to two umax once you allow it

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,399
it's not easy to go back to any other

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,399
editor

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,480
such a wonderful awesome texture data

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,560
gives you a lot of customizability

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:54,399
uh very extensible and a true

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:58,480
editor for a hacker hacker not in the

00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:03,360
mass media sense you know the hacker

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,360
as used in the hacker culture

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:13,200
yeah so now uh let's get to the

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,000
uh meat of the whole discussion so

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,640
this emacs has been successful for most

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,080
of

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,160
the past i mean for just for the fact

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,959
that the project has been active

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,880
and it's it keeps going even after 35

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,680
years is a testament to how powerful the

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,680
difference

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,080
and how great it is so

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,880
uh but still never nevertheless it's not

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
perfect

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,160
now i'd like to like for us to discuss

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,720
all the things that they'd like to see

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:48,640
happen in amex so me personally

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,720
i'd like to see so we all know that

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,880
i think we all would like to see you

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,279
know more things that is

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,240
directed towards that will help it

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,880
easily

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,480
make it easier for new people to get

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,920
into the universe

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,880
so one thing i feel is that a lot of

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,160
people like

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,040
a lot of writing almost everyone who

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
comes to unite

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,800
one of the things that everyone with our

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,760
doubt does is change things or make

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,120
things look appear maybe but it's

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,120
sometimes a better model

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,040
so at that point they might not even

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,720
have thought

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,399
hardly about explaining it or they might

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,440
not be aware of all the things they

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,399
should do

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,839
and so i think that maybe working a bit

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
on the user interface

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,519
might be helpful for someone who you

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,600
know might start out so that is my point

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,560
one thing that i'd like to do that i'd

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,680
like to see

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,079
another thing that i think uh is

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,120
kind of crucial to it you know to ensure

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,120
that

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
the imax stays on for the coming year

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,079
uh that's like uh a kind of website even

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,279
emacs uh like

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,959
those subsidies kind of an opinion it's

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,360
pretty good because when it comes to

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,760
documentation you next documentation on

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,760
the web

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,920
but the thing is that most people would

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,279
argue that you are

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,440
not supposed to read the imax

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,399
documentation on the web in your browser

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,399
you're supposed to release it

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,279
i know that is true but you know a lot

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,839
of beginners might not know that so

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,519
you know they when you know most of the

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,000
developer community

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,519
revolves around this thing you know it's

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,519
like a normal

00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,139
[Music]

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,279
and that sort of thing so that kind of

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,000
kind of experienced for me

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,320
so i'd like to see that get better over

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,680
uh coming so these are

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,560
the things that i'd like to see and you

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,040
can you know explain

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,040
later on

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,040
okay uh yeah so

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,480
uh how do we get emacs to work for

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,200
another 35 years

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,680
assuming that the computers remain the

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,360
uh

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,360
same for another 35 years

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,720
well that is one big problem but still

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,279
let's assume that it is going to be

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,920
there

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,440
uh let's uh uh let's assume that there

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
are going to be the same programming

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,240
language

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,839
yeah probably python is uh even the

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
python language has been there for 30

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,000
years

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,839
let's it will work i guess uh so

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,639
the first thing to note about uh emacs

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,440
uh is is about it's all about power

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,320
users

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,720
okay so uh there's a limitation you

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,519
can't expect everyone to get into uh

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,240
emacs

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,560
uh because it is fundamentally designed

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,760
for

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,079
hackers okay hackers and power users

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,000
it's

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,480
not a software like a firefox or uh

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,360
or a registrar which can be just picked

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,200
up by someone

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,959
i mean this is uh something meant for

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,040
developers and developers who are

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,040
willing to change the program

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,120
that is different from an ide normal id

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,240
which which is supposed to work from the

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,480
word go

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,160
but uh on the other hand emacs is a

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,360
software that

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,279
uh you know uh it's meant to be

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,480
looked into it's meant to be hacked by

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,959
people

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,639
uh if you really want it to work as you

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,399
expected to you have to look at the

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,000
source code and you have to be willing

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,639
to change it

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,079
uh there's always going to be i mean the

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,680
entire population is not going to be

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,160
like that we are going to find only a

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,120
small

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,880
population which is uh curious enough to

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,079
look at uh source code when it is

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,800
available

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,720
uh but what emacs does really well is it

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,120
makes it easy for you to do that it

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,000
makes it easy for you to

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,880
configure it using a programming

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,880
language

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,320
to look at its source code and make

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
changes as uh

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,600
necessary what we really need to do is

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,760
that

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,199
we should find we should attract the

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,000
people we should attract that kind of

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,120
people into this

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,959
field okay we should be really uh making

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,880
it more visible to the people with the

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,600
aptitude for hacking

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,760
uh i i believe that even after 35 years

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,040
you will find enough people

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,880
who are uh who have this kind of

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,839
aptitude who are hackers like this

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,600
so i'm assuming that eventually uh for

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,279
next 35 years our challenge will be to

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,320
find these kind of users

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,839
uh how do you find them so

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,519
one of the things that we can do about

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,959
that is uh

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,560
as abraham said as we start with it uh

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,639
we are going to get a very vanilla

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,880
interface for a van lay max

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,959
and it looks very dull it's really hard

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,399
to get started with it

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,839
um you know to learn the key bindings to

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,399
modify it as you like but the one recent

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,040
trend

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,880
uh that's going on in the imax community

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,560
is that uh there are a lot of new

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,440
distros coming out

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,240
one of them is uh space max the other

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,199
one is

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,279
doom i believe that uh we should be

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,000
concentrating more on this distrust

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,959
like for example in case of linux uh we

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,959
don't usually say

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,320
okay you can uh install linux on your

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,079
system you usually say you can install

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,000
ubuntu on your system or debian

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,440
system or fedora on your system just

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,360
like that in the future maybe we should

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,240
think about uh promoting

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,880
uh do me max or space max or something

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,560
new

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,000
depending on the theme maybe they can

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,120
create a special

00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,800
distribution for uh web development

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,320
which will have all the correct uh

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,560
packages installed and the correct uh

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,399
key bindings already installed that is

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,000
one thing that we can do so we i'm

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,199
hoping that we will see

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,399
better and better and more number of uh

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,720
uh distributions which work on band line

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,839
max or van linex will be like the

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,440
linux off editors and

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,120
these distributions will be like the

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,480
distribution the linux distributions

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,959
that are out there

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,519
another uh one exam another one change

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,639
that i would really like to see is um

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,560
uh we need a better user uh

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,320
key user interface or rather key

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,199
bindings than the emacs

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,600
key bindings just like ambadi said i

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:47,120
also had the salner and nerd problem

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,680
when i started with amax but i don't

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
have any

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,639
kind of problems with the evil

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,199
keybindings which i'm really familiar

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,680
with

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,720
i honestly believe that the vim keeper

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,000
endings are

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,000
much easier to pick up than

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,399
emacs key bindings and some of the

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,480
distros actually

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,959
follow that as well i i believe that

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,160
uh the doomy max as well as space max

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,520
both follow the

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,199
the same thing the uh beam key bindings

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,439
instead of the vanilla emax keybinding

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,520
so maybe we should see more of that

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,439
uh and for some people even that might

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,559
be hard evil key bindings are really

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,120
good uh

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,160
emax key bindings are also good both are

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,480
ancient

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,200
because they were used a long time ago

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,360
these days uh it's more

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,720
it's very different it's like kua mode

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,120
that is more common

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,320
uh which uses control c control v and

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,160
control z for

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,760
an uh undo redo uh sorry copy

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,080
undo and redo so maybe we should give

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,520
the

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,280
users uh a first time option just

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,640
select one of these key bindings and

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,480
maybe start there

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,840
it will reduce the uh shock of starting

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,400
with the max

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,400
that people face in the beginning and

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,160
another thing that we could see is we

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,200
need multiple pack i mean meta packages

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,120
maybe

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,600
what i mean by meta packages is that you

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,200
know let's say that you want to install

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,640
or let's say that you want to configure

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,200
your emacs for

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,720
web development i mean you may have to

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,960
install a dust and packages

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,720
okay that can be really hard maybe we

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,640
should find a way to combine all of them

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,799
together just one package which can

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,720
install all the 12 others to uh and

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,960
configure them appropriately

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,720
so if that happens it will be uh

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,200
probably easier for people to start with

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,559
the team

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,320
web development or amber assistant

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,880
development or anything like that

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,480
so these are my initial ideas um i'll

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,960
hand it hand this over to

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,960
ambari

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,880
i agree with google with everything he

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,679
said uh

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,520
emacs distro seems to be the way you

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,400
know

00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,320
starting the max way using the max key

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,919
bindings

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,320
and learning how to use the max gen1 you

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,400
know

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,200
it's different from bim and other ids

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,080
which

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,919
people are familiar with it's a steep

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,760
learning curve but once you get used to

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:20,080
it you will feel very comfortable you

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,080
will not do any other iv i think

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,080
yeah emacs has covered 35 years it

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,919
started in 1985 and it managed to

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,280
survive at five years so

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,400
i believe it that if i given that there

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,880
will always be

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,160
some hackers who who are very happy

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,360
about picking their business

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,240
and hacking you know uh

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,039
i believe there will be even if it is

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,720
more

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,720
personal i still believe

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,080
then there is this issue with developers

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,480
i don't have the statistics but uh i

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,000
have

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,000
information that um

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:04,840
developers are getting and you know

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,080
new developer is coming the rate is very

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,600
low

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,200
i said before i don't have the static

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,919
that's what i read

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,919
in that case

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:24,880
but if emacs get uh

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:29,120
such as attacking them using

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:33,440
qr1 as google said people need

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:36,000
something that works out of the box

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,440
uh it is not easy with the van live max

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,720
but with the help of

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,880
third party distros uh people can

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,000
get started with using tmx just like i

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,000
did it with space max

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:53,840
yeah distros will do a great

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,880
job in attacking people

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,880
remax and

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,960
no words coming in next 35 years we

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,039
can't predict

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,400
even the form of computing might change

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,400
there will be formless some meetings we

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,919
don't know

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,480
the ai can get integrated into texture

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,480
details as

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,080
in well of emacs uh you can use it as id

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,159
but

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,080
it doesn't stop there you can there are

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,760
people who live in the max c max is not

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,000
just for text editing

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,679
you can do all stuff you know if you

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,240
have seen the popular

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,960
kcd comic that there is a butterfly

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,960
moody max

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,080
yeah yeah as i said

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,840
people there are people who literally

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,840
live in emacs they don't need any other

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,400
packages you know everything just works

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,000
well with the max whether it is email or

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:58,000
their instant messaging application or

00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,200
rss feed whatever

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,280
whatever new software uh

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:10,559
appears it gets integrated into emacs

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,559
you can edit files remotely using emacs

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,120
and yeah

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,320
there are a lot of features that are

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,720
unique to emacs

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,480
there is also exwm emacs window manager

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,039
you can replace your desktop environment

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,840
with exwm

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,600
you can even play videos you may just

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,039
file management whatever you can

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,360
whatever you can imagine you can do it

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,360
with him

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,960
there might be a lot of users out here

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,559
who use

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,159
uh vs code so maybe i i think maybe we

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,200
can talk about the kind of

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:55,840
mindset you need to approach emacs with

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,840
so uh i think i i'll start so

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,600
things that you use that's meant not

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,799
just for program assessment for

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,480
general public and agreement but emacs

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,159
isn't necessarily one such thing it's

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,559
not aiming to be one of those

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,360
things right it's not it is not aiming

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,360
to be microsoft

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,159
you know that so it doesn't that adopts

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,400
itself to the user

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,720
instead of you know so most are other

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,840
ventures that you see in the ps4

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,000
what happens is that we learn the uh you

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,000
know

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,880
and that is something very powerful that

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,120
is what that's the kind of action you

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,880
need to go into

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:31,120
you know this doesn't have

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,720
a lot of things already into it

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,480
that you that you might have in

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,520
something like this because

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,919
that that is because you know you

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,640
imac wants to be that bare minimum and

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,880
they want

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,559
you to have the only thing or you don't

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,240
want you to be bothered with only things

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,760
that you will ever need and they don't

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,279
want to throw stuff that you might not

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,840
need

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,279
but again then there's also imax isn't

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,720
the one for you know keeping a lot of

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,039
things with it for example everything

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,840
from

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,600
the client to a web browser but yeah so

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,120
they are there's an idea that you should

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,279
go into universities

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,480
about creating something of your own you

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,640
know something that

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,720
you know that that is there for a long

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,200
time that you know it will be

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,080
like you know building your own once you

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
do that

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,600
you know nothing else really feels the

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,559
same because

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,880
e-max is like a very very tailored speed

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,480
you know

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,559
you wear that you know you get that

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,840
comforter comfort you get that

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,840
you know you get that amount of

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
productivity

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,279
yeah so uh so let me pick up

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,279
where abraham

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,720
has left as well so they're both talking

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,320
about hacker systems

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,960
emacs being a hacker's editor which is

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,520
very true but uh that is one aspect i

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,440
think

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,559
can't be emphasized enough if we are

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,480
thinking about

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,799
attracting more people we have to

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,520
emphasize the hacker culture there

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,279
emacs is not a system that stands alone

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,000
on its own it's a

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,120
it's a part of an entire ecosystem where

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,960
the user is

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,600
expected to uh modify

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,480
or configure systems as they like it

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,120
okay

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,000
one of the examples is maybe rs linux

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,480
it's a it's a scary

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
thing you have to uh configure your

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,919
entire operating system there

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,880
but uh there are a lot of other projects

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:51,360
like uh sucklers uh there are

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:55,919
um there are projects like um

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:59,760
uh geeks which all expects the user to

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,840
modify your own system uh unfortunately

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,840
uh the current state of software

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,600
development or software engineering

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,159
creates a split between the

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,520
programmers and consumers the

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,880
programmers create the system they

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,600
configure everything

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,320
and the consumers just use it that is

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,279
how

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,799
all our software is these days even if

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,880
you're a programmer using an idea

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,520
remember that you are just a consumer

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,880
you're uh you are using an id designed

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,840
by someone else

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,240
okay but in this ecosystem there's a

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,640
huge ecosystem where you have to

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,640
uh you're not just a programmer there's

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,919
no split between us programmer and the

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,720
consumer

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,039
the consumer programs the system by

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,440
themselves so that is a hacker system

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,799
and one of the major hacking systems

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,159
that i uh expect

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,799
will push emacs forward is the uh geeks

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,520
ecosystem uh that is programmed using

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,320
guile

00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,159
scheme uh the geeks ecosystem uh

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,080
has its entire operating system

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,399
including packages and the way to build

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,520
it

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,799
uh defined in scheme and

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,799
uh and it even its uh init system is

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,520
written in scheme so everything can be

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,480
hacked

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,760
uh in scheme and emacs is a very big

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,440
part of it so it's one

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,840
entire operating system that can be

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,039
controlled from emacs if you wish

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,640
the user interface is extremely powerful

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:31,840
in my case i use the uh

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:34,559
gui mode of e-max which is

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,159
which is like a very powerful terminal a

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,480
terminal which can not just

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,320
display text for you it can display even

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,000
graphics for you and

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,640
gui elements and

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
we haven't even touched uh the power

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,679
level that we can achieve

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,320
uh using uh the user interface

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,080
one of the examples is org mode the old

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,960
mode is a simple language which you can

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,080
learn

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,760
uh but the amount of the number of

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,720
things that you can do with org mode is

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,120
like

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,799
so many you can control your entire life

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,600
with that you can manage your underlying

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,440
you can just

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,840
you can note down things you can create

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,840
bookmarks you can

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,320
you can create a to-do list you can

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,159
create a contacts list

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,919
everything can be done from one single

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,480
interface so that is

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,000
one just an example of what emacs is

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,679
capable of okay

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,880
uh similar power is shown by the

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,679
e-max geeks which is the uh uh

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,039
user interface for controlling the geeks

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,480
operating system from inside

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,640
max there are a lot of uh

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,679
uses there are a lot of uses for the

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,440
user interface

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,360
and we need ways to uh integrate it

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,039
into emacs it's quite easy because the

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,679
elis is quite easy

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,679
and we need to expose people to this one

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:59,039
of the reasons why emacs has picked up

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,440
a lot recently is because of uh plugins

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,559
like

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,520
magic magic is uh front-end for it's the

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,559
best friend and for

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,880
gate okay uh

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,559
if you know how to use git from the

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,320
command line you will find

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:17,120
emacs sorry you imagine to be the best

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,080
alternative that is available for it uh

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,320
you have

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,880
other options like again org mode you

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,799
have even more options like uh

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,679
the tech the latex uh interface

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,840
uh we need to bring more into it so one

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,000
of the biggest focus areas should be for

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,360
again as abraham rajasthan web

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,159
developers i don't

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,120
uh i see that vs code has an advantage

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,240
there but

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,760
um in terms of web development but in

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,159
terms of emacs

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,919
there is an untapped potential we can do

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,840
a lot we can even display

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,679
web pages inside we can even have live

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,039
previews inside emacs but then

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,320
that is not there yet that would be one

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,120
big area where we can

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,840
bring people into emacs another good

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,799
area would be

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,600
uh embedded system development for me at

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,000
least

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,720
uh i use emacs for embedded system

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,240
development but

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,480
there are still tools that we can

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,159
integrate one of the best examples is

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,640
the platform air tool which is

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,960
uh by far the best uh embedded system

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,360
development tool that i have seen so far

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,240
uh but it is not yet integrated into

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,600
emacs

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,880
that is a shame because i feel that they

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,880
will go well together

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,080
that is one area that you can bring more

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,440
people in

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,120
another area is data processing and data

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,799
analysis

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,120
uh it is there we can

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,320
see jupiter notebooks from inside but

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,320
there is still

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,159
like i said the user interface is

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,840
extremely powerful we still haven't made

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,760
use of it

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,240
so these are the few areas where i think

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,279
uh we can attract more and more people

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,840
uh don't expect uh emacs to

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,679
uh attract everyone from around not

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,000
everyone is curious but you will find

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,200
enough people in every area

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,840
uh where they can use c-max where they

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,080
can take

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,039
advantage of the emax potential so

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,919
hopefully

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,679
next 35 years we will see the momentum

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,440
picking up

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,440
and over to you um buddy

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,960
okay uh i think one cannot

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,559
miss to talk about or whatever i'm

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,799
talking about t-max

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,799
i have heard that many people has

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,200
started to try emacs just because of

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,039
this or mode

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,039
even if it is just managed using plain

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,440
text files

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,039
so as i know i don't know if any other

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,799
interfaces to work with or

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,519
mode yeah it has an android interface

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,320
but on

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,159
desktop you i don't know if there is

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,120
anything that can come with emacs

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,159
for using or more oh it's a wonderful

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,640
package uh

00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,279
even if i haven't started to use it

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,240
properly

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,640
um you know the features of note taking

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,799
and

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,720
you know in the management or mods is

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,240
awesome

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,360
and i think yes it can still attract

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,399
people to e max

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:18,399
and yeah like abraham rajesh said

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:22,240
ui is also an issue emacs has a very

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:26,399
ancient ui uh but distrust like

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,399
adobe max and space max do well with

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,519
custom themes and or you know in the

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,799
dark team which

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,399
many people prefer uh

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,159
yeah talking about emacs even

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,640
productivity is what you should be

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,640
looking for

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,720
and then comes with the usage of mouse

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,679
emacs is

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,360
you know only keyboard oriented uh one

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:54,240
doesn't need any must work with dmx uh

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,399
yeah but unlikely uh people use mouse or

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,720
touchpad uh relatively more

00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,600
in imax competitive beam but still you

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,799
know uh

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,320
other than for navigation and

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:09,440
we don't use mouse much but if you

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,679
take an us code user especially if it is

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,280
a

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:16,720
newbie or you know they yeah

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,919
even the git uh madrid for

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,119
people everything they work with most i

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,320
think it's called support

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,200
feature and the ui is also pretty good

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,119
compared to

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,919
emacs being this ui and

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,359
it's not just about you can feel the

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,720
user experience also

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:40,320
you know there is no tabs by default

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,480
and it's just you know a plain text

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,000
area you see even the terminology is

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,000
completely different what you call

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,440
window in imax is not the window

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,919
in standard text editors it is called

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,560
frame

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,560
in emacs

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,680
e-max technology can also be confusing

00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,680
to newcomers

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,839
then

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,440
yeah do you believe that uh you so you

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,640
think that all the old terminology is uh

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,839
holding back people we should be

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,359
bringing them together

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,960
forward into the new world instead of

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,599
calling it a frame we should probably

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,040
call it

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,160
i mean so calling it a window we should

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,000
probably call it a frame or something

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,760
like that

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,160
uh do you think that that is going to

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,160
help it

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,480
it can be as even if it's a small issue

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,320
it's worth looking at you know yanking

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,040
even in vimenti maxi hanging means

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,359
different things right

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,880
you're absolutely right you mean it's

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,040
first time you see you yanking you

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,119
what the hell is young you say does it

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,720
mean coffee or

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,640
yeah you're absolutely right about that

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,160
but uh you know after

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,119
using bim and uh remax for about 10 or

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,079
12 years

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,440
i i tend to say yank and kill instead of

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,040
copying

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,960
sometimes i have problem communicating

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,480
with other people

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,920
but yeah you're right i mean

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,520
that is one thing that you should we

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,520
should be doing right we should be

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,640
changing the terminology we should

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,839
probably be changing the terminology to

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,839
modern terms right

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,839
but what about the key bindings they

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,880
they actually uh

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,280
match the old terms like for example uh

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,280
yank

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,960
yes control y and control k and all are

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,119
there

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,960
so we'll probably have to change that as

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,599
well of course of course people

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,119
uh learning a new binding is not gonna

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:44,400
be easy for a newcomer so

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:48,000
yeah qr mod may be helpful but

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,640
one thing one issue is that once

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,640
people see uh get convenient with the

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:58,000
already existing key bindings i doubt

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,000
whether they will switch to the emax way

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,040
but still i think having the

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,800
usual key bindings available in other

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,839
text detectors making it available in

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,839
e-max will also help

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,880
you know

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,119
oh no i'm not talking about changing the

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,040
default keyboardings in the official

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:43,200
email

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,200
what if we do this this might happen

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,680
i don't think the veteran ems users will

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,400
agree

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,040
with changing keybindings i was talking

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,359
about

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,079
offering an extra option to newcomers

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,280
whether it's

00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:03,040
through a party distro or

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,680
something that user can change easily

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,839
not spending much time on it yeah

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,920
regarding that uh

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,599
is it okay to answer the question uh

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,000
that the people are asking on the pad

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,960
right now because there's one there's

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,880
one question

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,040
directly related to that somebody's

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,480
asking if um

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,359
uh there'll be an easy option to set uh

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,160
parameters or rather configuration for

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:32,400
emacs like doesn't vs code

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,320
okay like that's an interesting question

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,359
yeah that is uh that is probably it

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,160
right uh vs code uh in vs code it is

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,760
uh written in javascript uh the

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,760
configuration is returned in javascript

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,960
but most of the configuration happens

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,640
from the gui right so is it is

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,640
something like that possible with the

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,680
emacs

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,200
so so

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,200
that is a very good question

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:04,000
so there is a configuration is for

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,960
so for the basic features like you know

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,680
there is a

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,599
so stuff like changing the font size or

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,000
changing uh the kind of font that you

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,760
use so

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,839
for simple stuff basic text initial

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,320
stuff that

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:18,560
you know way to do things but if you

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,119
really want to get to the you know

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,720
the real stuff of emacs you really need

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,720
to start writing consequences

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,720
but uh you know what i find when i

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:35,440
started with emacs is that um

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,040
emacs has a theme option which can be uh

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,320
configured from the gui

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,000
okay and as i told you the gui features

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,280
of emacs is something that has

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,320
not been fully exploited yet the gmax

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,720
gui is extremely powerful and the theme

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,520
shows i mean theming options show that

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,000
you can actually use the gui probably

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,160
more

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,839
options should be exposed through the g

00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,480
right it shouldn't be too hard

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,800
uh it should it should be able to we

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,079
should be able to do that on a buffer

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,640
uh we should be able to click buttons or

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,240
check select boxes selection boxes and

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,359
then it should automatically reflect in

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,359
the uh

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,640
files back-end files uh that i think is

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,160
definitely possible and that will

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,640
probably make it easier for people to

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,720
start with emacs

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:28,160
so yeah so waiting

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,240
yeah yes abraham yeah

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,839
would you like to add your points to

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,079
this question

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,000
actually i don't know such an option to

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:40,000
easily configure

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,560
emacs there is a customized command but

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,560
still

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:47,760
uh i don't think it has ccs in

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,960
us code yeah it is not a cc but

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,400
shouldn't don't you think that it should

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,240
be a ccs in vs code

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,440
it's not practically difficult it should

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,560
be possible right

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,680
yeah yeah probably

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,599
yeah so there's just also based on

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,240
it how can someone talk about the

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,680
company from vs4

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,800
so uh so i i think

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,599
so one thing is worth noting is you know

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,960
once someone you know really starts

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,480
using a man

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,800
there is no no way they can go back

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,800
i mean

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,720
and i i didn't see

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,800
the point i mean i used it like i used

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,200
it for javascript development

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,200
i

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,520
is said to be very great for javascript

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,359
and i really didn't

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,960
feel like i was missing out on anything

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:13,200
like that because

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:16,160
for one re max needed uh the uh

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,560
that engine from the escort for uh their

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,160
lsp mode so that is one thing anyway

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,760
but other than that there is change mode

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,680
and all those things are there for

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,119
english so the auto completion and

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,599
you know intelligent competition that

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,720
sort of thing i get it in email

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,119
so i don't necessarily you know

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,760
i understand the point going back to

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,839
imagine

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,960
i think that is the world that is where

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,119
they can be

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,119
getting a user to try out

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,359
that remax say that proper test when you

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,400
start to use it and feeds

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,000
you know the emacs for what it is

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,319
then i don't think they can go back to

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,319
us

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,839
doesn't have a property

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:43,440
once you get to uh use it once right so

00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,599
yeah uh related to that uh there's one

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,480
more question it's related to what just

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,839
abram just said it's about completion so

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,359
how does the completion in

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,680
a max look like is it good enough so uh

00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,520
can somebody say something about that

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,680
that's a question that uh somebody asked

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,240
on uh this is irc

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,760
okay uh i use company mode for

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,040
completion in emacs uh

00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:10,880
but uh i found it to be uh

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,359
you know uh uh lacking a little bit of

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,640
power

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:18,319
uh you know lsp board or not yeah

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,400
i was talking about company mode without

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,000
lsp but with lsp company mode is good

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,200
enough you know

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,760
i'm happy with it that's one thing

00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,800
uh you know talking about lsp that's one

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,720
thing that

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,319
one good thing that microsoft did lsp is

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,240
an open protocol

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,319
uh you can integrate it with emacs or

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,860
any other text editor that supports

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,160
uh lsp

00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,640
[Music]

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,359
so with uh lsp with company phone uh

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,640
works well

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,560
for communication and image and

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,839
accommodation other than for textual

00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,640
thing like in you know

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,160
for commands and all that is iv i used

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,800
helm in space max but

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,200
uh when i switched to and limits i tried

00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,200
iv and it also works well

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,839
it's you know you get condition

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,680
everywhere not just in the

00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,920
area that is absolutely true

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,599
i get completion everywhere too i mean

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,720
on the uh lower buffer

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:16,319
as well as inside uh it's no uh

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,839
it's not any less compared to uh vs code

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:21,680
especially when you have lsps in it

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,280
is there another question from the irs

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,400
or something

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,200
because i can't say that

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:33,839
uh well i don't see any other questions

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,839
from the irc yet

00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,000
okay so i guess we'll just wind this

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,040
thing up

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:56,240
so thanks for joining

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,240
us uh thanks for the organizers of

00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,839
