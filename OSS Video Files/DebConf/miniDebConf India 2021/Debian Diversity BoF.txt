For some, talking about diversity within the development community seems to be not part of what Debian is about, and that is Free Software. In this BoF we want to discuss how diversity within the community actually is enhancing and moving forward the project more than assumed, and how different live circumstances actually can lead to different views on how to approach things and thus also stir more creative approaches, for the benefit of all.
