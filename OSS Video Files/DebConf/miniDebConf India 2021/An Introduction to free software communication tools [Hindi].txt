The goal of this talk is to introduce why free software is important for our communications and various software tools to achieve it. Issues with non-free software would be highlighted. 

Free Software is often not sufficient to provide us with full control of our communication systems. Software/services would be judged on various criteria like user freedoms, privacy, decentralization, data ownership and federation. Software security by end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy would be discussed. 

Pros and cons for each would be highlighted to help the audience decide the right tool for their job.

Some software programs/services to be discussed Briar, GNU Jami, Signal, Matrix clients, XMPP clients and others.
