FOSSology is a collaboration project of the Linux Foundation covering license compliance tasks: It is a Web server system for users and a toolkit. As a toolkit you can run license, copyright and export control scans from the command line. As a system, a database and Web user interface provides you with a compliance workflow.

This session explains how we can bring the goodness of license/copyright scanning using fossology agents directly into gitlab in an automated way through a small demo project on Salsa.

copyright or keyword scanning agent

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,040
keyword agent

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,840
local photologically

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,749
[Music]

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,840
me

00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,950
[Music]

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,319
the main purpose is how to reduce the

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,959
audit work and make it incremental

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,840
so that compliance activity can be used

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,840
during the

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
release phase

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,419
[Music]

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,969
[Music]

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
uh

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,959
so it will reduce the overall time for

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,120
your uh

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,120
release okay

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,200
buddy

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,439
so right now uh we'll see it for gitlab

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
to be more precise using the debian

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,400
salsa

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,879
and we also support travis or esm

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,879
solution

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,630
[Music]

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
my

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
um

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,399
[Music]

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
foreign

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,420
[Music]

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,220
[Music]

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
um

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:40,269
[Music]

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,039
is

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,359
[Music]

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,000
keyword hey to jacob's file with the

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,000
exact time

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,360
uh this is a potential whitelist file

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,839
where you will be able to

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,440
see this file can scan will we'll again

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,360
look into it in the white list when you

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:17,200
explain the white list

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,200
so yeah finding reliable cases

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,839
let's see um

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
foreign

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
scanner

00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,560
but it's only on expedia standard base

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,000
ab regular expression came in a way and

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,120
it's very fast copyright kelly hamburg

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,040
copyright scanner used there which has a

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,040
very low false negative finding

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,800
email or even scan candidates

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,800
regular expression user find

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
a regular

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,959
okay now let's

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,640
project timka um project team developer

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,040
or project team can take care

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,000
uh what they what the action they need

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,120
to take

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,839
in at an early stage

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,839
scan repos can be hamlet

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,839
a particular commit

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,360
there so

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,040
the next one is the white listing so we

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,160
have seen this whitelist.json file

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,200
but we didn't explain it much there so

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,200
you have a hosted

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,129
[Music]

00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:52,260
[Music]

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,429
so that anything outside this license

00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,429
[Music]

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,320
so one will be able to achieve faster

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,320
release cycle

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,040
so uh jessica hum loco hot release

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,480
changes uh changes during the release

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,839
cycle so

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,839
the error will be much less

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,440
let's move to the next slide so

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,639
yeah so i have created a small demo

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,600
project

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,720
just to show you how it looks like so

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,639
let's go to the first

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,240
pull request which is the failure case

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,240
let's see how it looks like there

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,839
failure gives me a

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,279
the example

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,970
[Music]

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,880
that

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:42,240
copyright be passed okay either

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,759
so with this um i would like to end my

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,120
presentation

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,040
