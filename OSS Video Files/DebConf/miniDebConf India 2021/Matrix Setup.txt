Would like to go through a simple basic matrix setup.

I will explain briefly what a federation is and what the matrix protocol is. After that I will go through installing ansible on debian and setting up this playbook - https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy to run a matrix server.

I think anyone would benefit from taking a look at the matrix.org project, it's nice to have your own chat server.

hi

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:13,519
i'm i really like free software and also

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:18,640
open source i also like

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,640
decentralized systems and chat apps

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,720
all this made me really happy to

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,519
discover the

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,039
matrix protocol and the community behind

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,960
it and that's what i'm here to show you

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,640
today

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,480
so what is matrix matrix is mainly an

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,680
instant messaging protocol

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,239
it's open source there's clients and

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,960
servers which are open source and it's

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,879
federated so if you're

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,120
familiar a bit with how email works

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,480
basically servers can speak to servers

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,920
why use matrix

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,520
first of all you want to own your own

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,039
data

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,920
that's pretty cool second privacy and

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,960
security

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,159
is much better this way and

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,920
third the communication is better

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,439
in general in the world we have less

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
data fragmentation

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,439
we don't have thousands different

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,040
thousands of different apps

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
and we don't have data all over the

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,479
place but when we chat then we know we

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,000
can search in one place

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,000
and find what we chatted about

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,799
the fourth is interesting it's just a

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,320
modern

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,600
app so the the one of the clients

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,880
is pretty modern and it's just the ui

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,520
the ux is very good and there's a lot of

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,360
features

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,840
so it's it sounds stupid but it's a huge

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,920
reason to actually say yeah this is cool

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,840
we can use it we want to use it and it

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,399
helps the other arguments as well

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
interesting facts about matrix it's out

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,320
of beta

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,799
since 2019 the french government

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,439
and the german ministry of defense are

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,840
using it

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,080
the apps are called teach up and bw

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,560
messenger

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,599
there's an interesting feature or

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,920
capability

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,400
uh which is bridging you can

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,840
bridge popular other messaging apps to

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,599
make the

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,480
s the you know the move smoother or

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,280
to yeah still be able to use the others

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,879
but actually

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,080
uh stay on the open source clients

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,120
and using as much as possible the

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,879
matrix protocol natively so

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
whatsapp bridge telegram bridge

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,000
slackbridge and others

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,040
um another interesting fact is on

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
thursday

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,239
authorities in india filed a petition

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,080
alleging that new terms weren't

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,920
the new terms of whatsapp of course

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,879
weren't only a threat to personal

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,879
privacy

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,040
but to national security as well so it's

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,879
a really interesting fact to

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,879
get this in right now and if someone

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,560
asks you hey

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,080
i'm using whatsapp i don't want to use

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,440
whatsapp anymore don't say

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,239
signal say why don't you use the matrix

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
why don't you

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,800
host your own server that's much safer

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,319
much better

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,000
so here's a nice

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,720
overview of the components that we're

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,120
going to look at today

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,959
of um the installation that we're going

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,280
to go through today

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,159
the core components synapse the

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,680
reference implementation of matrix

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,879
of the matrix organization and

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:43,120
element web the reference implementation

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,120
of a web client

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,599
a database and some jitsi components so

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,120
we can

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:56,239
also have a nice video conferencing app

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:59,599
built into the element matrix client

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:03,200
um supporting components proxy server

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,920
turn server identity server yeah

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,000
not that important but also comes with

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
it

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
so let's go over the core components

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,519
again just

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,359
see how it looks like on this slide so

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,600
we have the

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,280
blue um

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,759
components here are the docker

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,160
containers the red

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,199
ones are just the clients here and the

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
purple ones

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,880
is are what the purple out the purple

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,120
arrows

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:43,199
are what components are using

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:46,880
the matrix protocol uh smartphones

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,880
desktop desktop apps

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,600
they communicate through the turn server

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,800
when it comes to peer-to-peer

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,360
calls that failed then it goes through a

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,440
turn server

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,199
[Music]

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,280
also when using the jitsi components

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,800
they directly

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,120
they directly use the jitsi components

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
but all the rest is basically the matrix

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,520
protocol so all the rest goes through

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,960
here also browsers are also clients

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,800
um browsers when they

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,240
want to get the you know gui components

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,919
and all that for the website

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,520
then they go through the proxy as well

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:30,560
and get it from our

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,800
element client web component

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,759
which we're also going to be running

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,840
with this setup

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,440
all the rest is basically the matrix

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,919
protocol

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,080
going from these element clients browser

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,560
smartphone desktop apps

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,840
to the proxy and then either going to

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,840
the identity server

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,080
if they need to if they come through an

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,400
identity uh

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,199
so if you're using an email to identify

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,960
yourself and not

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,240
part of the um not the exact matrix

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,680
username then you would go through the

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,800
identity server

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,840
but the main point is they all

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,600
most of them go most of the matrix

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,800
um requests go to

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,080
api requests go to the synapse

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,840
server the reference server that we're

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,160
using

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,280
and the postgres

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
is attached to that

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,440
the postgres database

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:38,479
so this is how it's simplified

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:42,080
only the matrix protocol

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,759
the client send a api

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,039
a rest api

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:53,440
or http request

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,680
make to matrix dot your base domain

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,039
that goes to the proxy and the proxy

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,120
sends it

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,960
either to the identity server if it's to

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,080
identify first but usually to the

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,759
synapse

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,199
server and the synapse server sends it

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,199
back back to the clients

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,280
yeah small

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,520
slide about how the browsers go to

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,360
element dots

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,039
your base domain so in my case

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,960
example.org and then

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,479
go to the proxy go to the element web

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:31,520
and get that back

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:33,919
we're going to be using this

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,280
playbook this ansible playbook which

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,840
sets up

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,840
dockers

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,160
to run all these components that we just

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,840
spoke about if you're not familiar with

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,199
ansible just think of it as a

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,120
tool that helps you get stuff

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,520
running specifically these dockers

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,720
running if you're not familiar with

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,479
dockers then it's just yeah small

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,720
containers running on your machine

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,680
and uh small isolated parts that are

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,560
just running so that

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,319
they're not disturbed and don't have any

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,680
dependencies

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,720
um i'm gonna go to

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,160
oh yep i'm going to go to this link

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,400
so you can also go to this link if you

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,599
want to see

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,039
if you want to read slower but

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,400
but you can always just follow here

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,400
what i'm doing so

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,399
on the page you go to the docs

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,479
and you go to the readme and that's

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,040
where it all begins

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,839
prerequisites um

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,970
unfortunately it only runs or it only

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,279
runs stably on

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:55,760
[Music]

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:57,600
x86 and debian 9 plus

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,640
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,279
to run the ansible playbook

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,399
locally usually ansible is used from a

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,519
different server

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,120
and it's it installs stuff on on

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,640
another server so from one server to

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,360
another from one machine to another

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
machine

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,120
and we're going to use it on the same

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,120
machine

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,279
um these are the things that you

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,000
you you have already because debian

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,000
usually has

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,360
that so root access python

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,560
3 you need to install ansible

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,480
so just install ansible

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:40,800
um this you don't need it's just a

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:44,399
services check and then some dns

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,279
records and um you know you have to have

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,399
a domain

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:53,440
and if you're if you're not just

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,440
testing and running locally but

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,040
it's better to just run it with a domain

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,160
and then

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,640
[Music]

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:07,279
all these ports you have to open them

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,480
so continuing configuring the dns

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,200
records

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,680
you would have to have a i'm just going

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,000
over

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,440
quickly because i don't have enough time

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,240
so you would have to have

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:23,600
an a dns record matrix pointing at

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,240
the ip address of the server

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,079
that you uh want to have everything

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,720
installed on so not the server that

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,600
you're

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,200
using it from in our case we're doing it

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,839
the ansible playbook is

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,519
going to run on the same machine that

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
we're installing everything on so

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,200
uh yep and then

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:51,920
element subdomain going to matrix dot

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:56,720
your domain cname another c name for

00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:01,839
jitsi that's what we are doing and

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,839
another record for um

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,000
for federation all this is when you have

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,959
a real setup we're just gonna

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,240
see that it works locally so i just

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,440
showed you this but

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,560
we're not gonna do that

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,600
configuring the ansible playbook the

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,120
instructions are

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,560
are here so i'm just going to show you

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,320
how to do it

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,480
with the debian gui

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,160
but if you want to use the terminal you

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,160
can also go through these instructions

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:42,240
after just

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:46,240
cloning the project or downloading the

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,279
the project from github you would have

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,920
an examples directory you can

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,000
you need to copy these two files to

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,240
other places so the hosts file goes in

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,560
the inventory directory

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,560
and the hostvars.yaml goes

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,399
in the hostvars directory

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,639
in another directory you create so you

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,240
create this directory here matrix dot

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,160
and then your domain name and here is

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,360
the host and here you change the host

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,720
vars

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,760
file to vars.yaml

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,279
and in the other file in the examples

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,480
directory you put in the inventory

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,680
directory

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,680
here it is hosts

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,040
one more thing the hosts file of the

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,000
machine itself

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,839
because i'm not because i don't have a

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,200
because i'm running it locally without a

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,200
dns records and a

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,160
domain name i just chose something

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,360
example.org and i'm

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,000
i faked these three uh

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,399
subdomains to go to my private ip

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,399
address

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:06,240
the hosts file

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,560
is gonna look like this

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,560
um

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,839
for some reason i can't

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,480
modify this file

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:36,399
so i'm just going to open it again

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,399
um

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,560
there you go now you can see the last

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,160
line is

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,120
matrix dot and here you need your

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,120
domain name and then the ansible host we

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,600
have localhost here but what you need is

00:13:51,120 --> 00:14:00,000
your ip address your public ip address

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,279
and then there's the ansible ssh user

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839
which is root because we're

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,199
running it on the same machine from

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,480
which we're running the playbook

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:14,320
and we're logged in as root

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,440
so ansible

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,160
connection is also local because we're

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,560
not running it from a different machine

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,560
then we have over here

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:32,560
the most important file which has

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,519
variables that we want to configure for

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,120
the setup

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:40,240
with ansible the matrix domain is

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,560
your domain name and

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,800
here you have if you want ssl

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,040
certificates to be generated

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:52,320
then you can have you can put your email

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,440
here so they send you emails uh

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
when there's something with a

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,519
certificate

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,120
generate two secrets uh one for the turn

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,120
server one for the synapse server which

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,639
is again the reference implementation

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,839
of the matrix server you can use this pw

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,959
gen tool for that real quick

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,360
we i'm doing a i'm doing

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,519
a self sign for the ssl certificates

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,160
because there's no domain name

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,199
and it's all local so that's this

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,680
variable here

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,760
you don't need this variable if you're

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,839
not doing it locally to test

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,839
then i also added the matrix jitsi

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,560
enabled variable so we have jitsi

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,759
because that's optional

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,160
and then i have here this can be

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,560
generated with a script

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,240
from the inventory scripts and you don't

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,880
have to type it all in but it's just

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,320
a few secrets and passwords for jitsi

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,120
components

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,279
and the last variable is just enabling

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,199
registration because that's disabled per

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,639
default if you want other people to be

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,360
able to

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,440
log in uh to register on your server you

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,560
can enable that for them

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,360
otherwise you can just use a bash script

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,120
or

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,399
there's even an ansible command here to

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,440
to add users

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,320
so back to here

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,199
this is what i just explained here and

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,440
installing

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,199
is this part here so if you're not

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,839
running locally you might have to add

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,279
ask pass or if you're doing it with ssh

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,639
keys then minus

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,639
k but

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,839
i'm just going to use this command

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,959
straight up and

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,440
after that you have to use my comma

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,440
start

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,959
to get this command done straight

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,959
afterwards as well that's what i'm going

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,480
to do

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,399
i already ran this just

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,600
so it's quicker because we don't have

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,240
enough time

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,040
so i'm gonna uh i don't know if i want

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,040
to run this again

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,880
yeah i don't think we have enough time

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,199
but if you run this basically

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:10,160
then it sets up everything

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,400
and obviously you're probably going to

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,880
get some kind of error

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,000
don't worry about it just look at the

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,039
error or

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,760
ask a question in the in the group

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,520
set for for this playbook on the matrix

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,959
or you can

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,480
uh google it but

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,240
you can just ask in the group that's

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:36,799
easier after you run it

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,799
if it's locally don't forget to um

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,880
accept the self-signed certificates on

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,160
all the subdomains that we used so

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,919
element dot

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:49,039
your domain your fake domain name and

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,120
jitsi dot whatever and matrix dot

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,120
whatever you have to

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,640
enable the self-designed certificates

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,679
but i already did that so in here you

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,840
can just do

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,520
sign in i already created an account and

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,559
you just do

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,559
tests what's the account name

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,840
and you just log in and that's it

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,840
and then you this is the setup

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,880
and here you can already look for people

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,039
and well locally you can't really do

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:28,160
that but

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:32,160
that is the setup

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:36,400
um if there's time

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:40,000
then this will be shown as well

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,480
here we have here i have my instance

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,600
running on hagai.website and i have a

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,039
nice bridge here

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,880
i'll post links on the pad you can test

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,120
test the bridge you can see here that

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,880
people are writing from

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,799
whatsapp telegram slack and other matrix

00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,679
instances here you see

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:05,760
uh telegram here's just a guy here is

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,880
whatsapp uh whatsapp user

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,400
um i also use this as a

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,840
general way to communicate every day

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,400
with my whatsapp users

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,520
they don't even know that i'm using a

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,120
element

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,960
as a client to use my whatsapp and

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,440
telegram

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:31,360
and yeah i really recommend it

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:36,480
i want to thank uh slavi for making this

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,480
amazing ansible

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,960
playbook and uh suman for helping me

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,080
with this

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:48,960
and manu for helping me with this and

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,960
uh yeah i'm looking forward for the

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,640
questions

00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,640
[Music]

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:09,440
