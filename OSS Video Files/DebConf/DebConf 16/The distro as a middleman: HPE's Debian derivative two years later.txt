like I've got a vet five minutes behind

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,340
so I'm at and zipped through a few

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,389
things

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:15,080
okay so 2015 HP looks was an internal

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:17,880
Linux distribution based on Debian Jesse

00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,189
it was if you went to this top last year

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,449
you might have seen one of my colleagues

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:27,300
give a 2014 version and it used to be

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,390
called page Linux but when HP was split

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,769
into two companies last year it's the

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,020
marketing people got ahold of it and

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:37,920
it's now called HP Linux which is much

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,710
more of a mouthful to say we had one in

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,239
customer one internal custer customer HP

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,879
Helion which is HP's hybrid cloud

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,620
product for a large scale installations

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,969
of OpenStack okay the things that aren't

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,530
in Jesse we have this idea called

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:01,530
foreign packages where you can we would

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,019
add new packages that weren't in Debian

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,479
we can add them as a foreign package we

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,010
can back port security security fixes or

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,049
add different versions and just

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,950
generally have things that aren't Jesse

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,580
in our distribution and obviously we

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,900
obviously but we would like to keep

00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,729
Edgefield Linux as close to Jesse as

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,400
possible but unfortunately that sir

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,080
can't do that all the time so but we

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,390
have the foreign packages but the only

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,570
the idea that a temporary and that we

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,000
would like to replace them with free

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,000
version whenever possible sorry

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,119
Debian versions whenever possible in

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,070
kernel land in 2015 we are using kernel

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,610
3.14 and letter 4.1 and we had a big

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,560
kind of testing program where we would

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,780
do qualification and performance testing

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:59,430
to ensure everything works out of the

00:01:51,780 --> 00:02:02,340
box okay so in 2016 what does hedge PDA

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,840
look like in 2016 well it's still an

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,399
internal HPE

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,039
sorry still an internal Linux

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,560
distribution based on Debian Jessie and

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,400
at the end of last year

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,200
the CTO named HP Linux a technology

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,510
standard within the company and this is

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,150
a pretty it's a pretty big deal

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,620
it's pretty exciting and I'll talk about

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,040
that in a bit

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,370
and we've grown from a single internal

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,830
customer to a half dozen or so internal

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,250
customers all building products in

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,050
various stages of development we still

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:40,700
have the foreign package idea

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:42,470
so we're but we've in doing in this last

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,900
year we've managed to replace a couple

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,530
of the foreign packages with free

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:51,140
versions and we've also started using

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,450
injective Jessie back ports as a way of

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,360
getting replacing we're getting more

00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:01,580
up-to-date versions of packages into HP

00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:03,230
Linux and of course we're still keen on

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,610
minimizing the difference between HP

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,739
units and Jessie and yeah this year

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:13,900
we're still doing our when we move to a

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,900
4.4 kernel and we're still doing our

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:20,200
testing program okay

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,930
[Music]

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:30,090
okay as mentioned in the last slide HP

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,390
Linux is an hour technology standard in

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,640
HP e and this means that all all new

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,740
products and major releases of the

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,260
existing products that using embedded

00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,810
Linux now have to use HP Linux which is

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,060
basically Debian and this has a whole

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,320
host of benefits mappings it's really

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,720
exciting

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,950
and it's pretty exciting that a company

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,420
like HP is chosen to use exactly one

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,150
version a distribution of legs within

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,460
the company I think prior to that there

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,360
were about eleven maybe bit us as eleven

00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,920
different types of Linux eleven to

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,090
fourteen Wow okay that's I didn't think

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,850
they're even worth 14 different

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,040
distributions of Linux for now okay

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:15,090
anyway so fourteen done one nothing

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,340
that's that's really a good thing and so

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,820
what does this mean for what does this

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:25,020
mean I think it means more investment in

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:28,560
Debian by HPE and we've grown from a

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,480
system grown from one customer internal

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,300
customer up to a half-dozen well it also

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,820
means we're making more developers

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,280
hopefully dead more Debian developers

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,290
hopefully little D and Big D Debian

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,320
developers and are also making more

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:46,860
users and included in that is customers

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,480
as well I think like any company the

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,580
customers come in a range of different

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,580
kind of technical sophistication and

00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,480
customs and some customers actually like

00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,980
logging in to their product and poking

00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,250
around and seeing what's there and they

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:05,930
I believe some of them are happily

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,930
surprised to find their own debian

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,760
unfortunately sadly so some products a

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,620
market segments can't be switched over

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,440
to Debian so I think there is an

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,570
exception process for our customers like

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,240
a telecommunications or other people who

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,950
need some real time requirements and

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,050
other things that can't be satisfied

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,050
with a general Linux distribution

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,630
okay so what we did in lessons learned

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,610
I'm gonna divide that up into three

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:40,240
different sections talking about product

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,490
what you in a product way what we what

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,320
we did in the community and what we did

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:50,340
in terms of process so firstly I think

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,590
yeah in this this talk last year Josh

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,360
Josh mentioned that we did sorry the

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,150
person who presented this top part you

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,340
mentioned that we did a successful and a

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:06,250
1.0 release of Helion using HP Linux as

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,860
the base OS so that went that went

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,410
really well and we did this year we did

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:15,910
a bunch of to ponics releases and just

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:18,490
recently a 3.0 release and yeah I think

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:22,660
I've been a bit lucky in that a few of

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:25,180
the products that were forced highly

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,310
suggested to use HP helix we're based on

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,290
a bunch of it's not such a big jump from

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,590
Debian to it one - sorry from a bun to

00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:34,210
do Debian so that I think that worked

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:38,170
out pretty well in terms of getting new

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:40,840
customers on board HP Linux is a

00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:44,830
technology standard a lessons learned I

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,770
think the tricky reference to customers

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:50,830
really well we had one customer in 2014

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,930
he Leon and I think we made a really

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,060
good effort to treat them well and they

00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,440
spread the spread the word among the

00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,010
company I think so amongst the

00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:03,670
management that HP works was worked

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:07,300
really well for them if they gave us a

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,530
very tight series of deadlines that we

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,820
managed to get everything working for

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,850
them and I think I believe everyone was

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:16,450
reasonably happy in the end another

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:20,200
lesson delivering enterprise software

00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:22,300
and Debian is definitely possible and I

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,580
think that's mostly something that we

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,110
show you inside the company that we can

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:33,460
do we can do what we said we were going

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:35,140
to do using Debian yeah in terms of

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,850
telling an entire company that have to

00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,729
change the next distributions I think

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,890
that could have been could have been bad

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:44,050
but if it's just if it just works

00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,520
you've got support in place there's

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,780
generally not there wasn't imagining

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,270
does a huge amount of pushback on that

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:55,000
and parallel to that centralization is

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:58,000
really important for letting people know

00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,100
how to use H Linux well it's all about

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,020
you can't just tell people to go and use

00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,600
Google and expect them to be happy you

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,060
need some some central locations for

00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:13,960
documentation and mailing lists and kind

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:17,680
of human points of contact in the

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,420
community area we're this year we were

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,340
replaced some of the vendor packaging

00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,040
some of the foreign packages with free

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,540
packaging so with the assistance of with

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,610
a lot of systems from the packaged Java

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:33,850
team we built a version of elasticsearch

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:36,850
the open source text indexing and

00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:39,130
searching engine we replace the vendor

00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,830
packaging with a free version in debian

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:45,910
which you can use now and digitally for

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:48,070
docker that not is available now as in

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,260
the packaging which is then the

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:54,070
packaging is someone rather than the

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,690
author sorry the parent company has

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,790
built this binary blob when you install

00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,850
that and you can imagine that people

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,710
might not necessarily be keen on that so

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:07,900
again with a lot of assistance from the

00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:11,650
package go team we have really nice nice

00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:13,870
baking 1.11 point to actually version in

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:18,640
docker in debian and that was uploaded

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:22,480
to unstable yesterday which is good in

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,220
the community we did some linn sitting

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,870
over there has done some country help

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,790
doing some contributions to you fe

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,510
secure bouche and that's apparently

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,490
being shipped to customers and we were

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:38,560
working on that around 64 as well as AMD

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:42,130
64 and martin martin Mikkel Maya may be

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,920
here he did several full rebuilds around

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:47,650
64 archive on some of the some of our

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,950
hardware I complete with kind of filing

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,450
bugs and doing uploads and things like

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:57,030
that

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:59,010
was was fun lessons here working with

00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:02,880
the community takes takes a lot of time

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,800
I mean that's you can't no III as we've

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,550
seen in the internal land you can't just

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,460
come in to a community or some group

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,380
within Debian and dump a whole lot of

00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,570
stuff on them and say here you go you've

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,120
got to kind of build relationships and

00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,880
trust within the community and that

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,490
takes a long time I'd liked a lot more

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,310
than you think it wouldn't and the other

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,490
lesson it's yeah it's actually hard work

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:32,010
convincing people to get really involved

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,770
in the Debian community into spice kind

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,500
of our bosses are saying it's fine you

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,360
can do it you go ahead and do open

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,170
source stuff it's still hard for people

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,970
to do I think yeah from a time point of

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,980
view and also if you're not used to

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,020
working out working out in the open

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,450
having all your work available for

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,860
scrutiny by by everyone I think that can

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,190
be a bit that can be a bit

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,470
confrontational but you're hopefully

00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,380
hopefully next year we can say we've got

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:08,930
some more Debian developers and Debian

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:11,820
maintainers and finally our process

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:14,910
improvements so I think we did a really

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,190
good job this year and getting HP Linux

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,690
we're going inside the company getting

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,550
it used by lots of different people lots

00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,220
of different groups but unfortunately I

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,440
don't think success is really led to any

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,090
giving it even us any more resources any

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,770
more people or any more money in fact

00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:33,360
quite the opposite so yeah it's a bit of

00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,730
a theme I guess over the last four or

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,830
five years we always have to do more

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,930
with less and I think the best way to do

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,880
that is who's through process and better

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,790
processes and improving your processes

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,160
and to do that when one of the things

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:50,570
we've done is implement this what's

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,850
called a baseline release process where

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,910
every four weeks we generate a new

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,980
version of HP Linux so half of that for

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:03,270
two weeks developers in the company can

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,350
upload new versions of packages now do

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,540
all the testing and

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,730
there's a freeze a very short

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,850
comparatively short freeze and there's a

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:14,670
two-week phase of load testing and stall

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:17,280
testing and things like that so there I

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:21,620
mean so every month we have any version

00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:23,730
of HPD limits for customers to try out

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,920
we've been doing lots of package

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,400
acceptance testing so when you do a d--

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,920
put their whole suite of tests around

00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,660
run against that package and they're

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,820
actually more strict in some areas and

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,890
debian which is which can be a bit

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,970
frustrating if you need to add some you

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,820
need to go back and fix a bunch of

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,110
things but we've got lots of meta data

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,730
we're trying to keep the meta data

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,520
consistent we're trying to add more meta

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:51,600
data so we can do package analysis and

00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:54,180
package tracking also in similar thing

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,700
in security as well as following along

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,250
with the Debian security team we have

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,080
our own internal security team with our

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,420
own proprietary

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,770
open source and proprietary tools to do

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:09,660
more security analysis on the archive

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:12,510
and finally everyone's got to write

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,010
their own kind of CRC system see our CD

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:18,060
system right so we've got our own one of

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:20,940
those to do bare metal basically doing

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,340
bare metal and different hypervisor

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:27,870
testing so part of our test Suites

00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:31,110
running HP nuts on bare metal on various

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:33,210
bits of hardware and also doing testing

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,950
on the different funny we're doing

00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:40,350
within us three at supporting three

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:42,960
different type advisors so lessons here

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,340
I think I think I think two technical

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,220
problems are actually pretty easy to

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,980
solve you you know get some smart people

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,320
in a room together and you know a

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,350
solution pops out a few days later but

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,030
yeah getting human processes working I

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:01,290
think gives them much harder much harder

00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:03,360
problem yes I think it takes a lot

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,310
longer than technical problems and

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,930
process improvement is you know

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,210
continuous and never-ending

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,850
I'm pretty sure we're not gonna go back

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,310
to the good old days and you know

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,620
people and money everywhere so always

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:20,060
got to do always got to be improving our

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:23,470
processes yeah okay so that was the

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,579
first part of the talk there any can I

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,940
quickly say if there's any questions

00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:34,790
about HP Linux before I go on to the

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:38,389
next part okay fantastic

00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:44,180
okay so the rest of this talk I'd like

00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:53,089
to explore this idea of slaves oae okay

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:55,459
about two sets of slides okay I want to

00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:57,740
explore the idea about thinking about a

00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:00,230
little distribution using the analogy of

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:06,230
a middleman and how I can use that to

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:07,899
communicate the value of debian I say

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,850
what is it okay so what is the middleman

00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:13,610
if I'm a middleman inserts themselves

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,290
between two parties with the goal of

00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,569
making the transaction between those

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,519
parties

00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:22,310
easier or cheaper and ideally the

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,910
middleman adds adds more value to both

00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:27,410
sides than it consumes I think middleman

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,959
middlemen probably have a bit of a bad

00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,880
reputation in society at the moment and

00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,880
people think I guess people think of

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,250
middlemen as parasitical or you know not

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,709
actually producing anything of value but

00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:44,209
if you you know if you if they're in

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:46,569
between two parties and provide benefits

00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:48,620
to both sides and they don't you know

00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:50,930
consumed a lot of that benefit

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,560
themselves then the middlemen little man

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,560
can be quite good

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,880
okay okay so examples examples of

00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,130
middlemen eBay so I guess this is kind

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:09,280
of an obvious one

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,570
I think it's in the mission statement

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,870
you know bringing together buyers and

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,430
sellers so eBay if you've got a whole

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,510
bunch want to sell a whole bunch of junk

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,850
at home

00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,350
eBay will help you find you know some

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:24,160
people who want to buy all of your junk

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:29,020
and they take a little little card with

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,730
the transaction Facebook I think

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:35,020
Facebook is a really good middleman so

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:38,530
you've again the parties involved people

00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:41,170
and Facebook allows you know you two as

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,840
a provider of you know status updates to

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,760
bet your dinner you can provide people

00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,170
you can Facebook you know hooks you up

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,900
with people who are interested in

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,160
pictures of your dinner and although

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,630
they don't actually charge a fee for

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:58,120
that like like eBay does Facebook shows

00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,990
you at so that's the that's the cost in

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,990
that transaction

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,680
okay now getting a bit more abstract

00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,440
here and middleman a doctor is actually

00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,900
a little man so on one side there's you

00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,030
and you've got a cold or something and

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,470
on the other side of the transaction is

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:19,690
no medicine other you know how the

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,060
medical specialists or kind of services

00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:24,370
like x-rays and whatnot in there the

00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:26,800
doctor acts as a middleman to connect

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:32,260
you to the medical services and the

00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:33,460
medical products that you need and

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,610
finally

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:40,650
daddy it's my proposition here that

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,650
Debian user is the middleman

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,720
okay so Debian distribution is the

00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,519
middleman who are the who are the

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,049
parties here well obviously there's

00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,590
users and software they're kind of

00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:54,850
obvious

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:57,220
and they're also Debian developers and

00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:00,039
upstream developers so it's a bit more

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,389
complicated than kind of eBay where you

00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:03,580
know one person was selling to one other

00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:05,499
person is you know many different

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,590
parties many different types of parties

00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:09,909
are all kind of connecting together and

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,730
we can we can think a bit about what

00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:15,159
value Debian heads to each of the

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,799
parties here so users get access to a

00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:20,080
lot of software that works well together

00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:24,249
works well you know I mean inside the

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,559
system the software gets access to you

00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:28,330
know a pool of users and I'm Debian

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,070
developers you know I have access to

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:32,580
each other and we can probably think of

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:35,259
other benefits that are that are

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,450
provided by Debian acting as a middleman

00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:39,580
between these different groups but I

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,679
think yeah Debian we get to as a Debian

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:46,029
developers you get to meet other Debian

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:49,629
developers to work with and being a

00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:52,419
community with upstream you know they

00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,889
get access to a I will integrated kind

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:59,409
of operating system environment and the

00:18:53,889 --> 00:19:02,049
users as well okay so let's think about

00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:06,970
HP let's just throw as a middleman what

00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:10,509
value does HP e Linux add to HP e well

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:13,149
when we were forming the HP Linux team L

00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:15,190
some questions from high up saying you

00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:17,679
know why do we need to have all these

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,960
people working on Linux isn't Linux a

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,210
solved problem and you can just download

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,749
it and put it on a CD and run it and you

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,749
know that's it

00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:29,049
but yeah so from the point of view of

00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:32,230
the user selects is a Linux distribution

00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:34,269
is basically a solved problem of course

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,710
anyone who's actually been involved in

00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:37,529
putting together a distribution at the

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,110
at their you know the technical level

00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:42,279
actually knows that it's a lot of work

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,310
so I guess in some ways we're kind of

00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:47,030
victims of our own success in that

00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:49,770
in being easy to use and working well

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:53,640
makes it appear really easy when it's

00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:55,770
not I mean I've developed a question to

00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,330
ask - I mean if you're paying if you're

00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,890
signing paychecks for all these people

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,660
it's a good way it's pretty important

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,180
that you know what value you're getting

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,460
here and that's the that's the big point

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,530
of the section you know how can we tell

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,100
people who are you know signing our

00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:14,550
paychecks what value we're providing by

00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,230
having a length distribution so I've

00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,960
gone through a couple of points here

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:22,380
that I think the value of the HP Linux

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,080
provides it's a centralized point for

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,900
communications I mean a lot of I mean

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,930
people engineers with the HP and

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:34,020
elsewhere are pretty technical gals and

00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:36,900
girls and gals but you know it's nice to

00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:41,190
have a centralized point where you can

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:44,700
get documentation mailing this stuff you

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:46,980
can talk about things internally so HP

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:52,380
Linux acts as a centralized point for

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:54,180
communications okay we bear risk in the

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:58,290
company for technical and legal issues

00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:01,470
so what do I mean by that so if you've

00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:03,270
got 15 about 15 product groups you know

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,900
which one of them was responsible for

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:08,760
the scuzzy driver working say everyone

00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,770
uses a scuzzy driver but you know no one

00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,450
is actually responsible for it you know

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,220
their response the product teams are

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,590
responsible for the product they're not

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,380
responsible for making sure Linux works

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:21,960
so that's one of the points of value

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:27,380
that HP in acts as a middleman provides

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:29,460
we own some of those common things

00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,160
technical things and on the legal side

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,680
too I mean who's in a greener 50 set of

00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,230
15 products now which one of those

00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,180
product is responsible for ensuring that

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,250
Debbie and that's sorry that they comply

00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,010
the product complies with all the legal

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,120
obligations that we have in terms of

00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,880
Licensing and distribution

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,910
well again everyone is responsible but

00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,720
you know practically no one is so HP a

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:56,950
Linux acts as the point

00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:02,620
to take that risk and in a similar kind

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:05,309
of vein linux HP linux allows to to

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:09,640
share large costs within the company so

00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:11,470
there are some certifications that to

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,929
sell in to sell to certain parts of the

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,789
US government market you need to have

00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:17,620
some particular security certifications

00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:23,169
and I believe they're ludicrously

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:25,030
expensive to do and again anyone any

00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:26,860
particular product is probably not going

00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,720
to be interested in paying the millions

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,580
of dollars

00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,059
whereas a new agent HP Linux as a

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,130
middleman we can take that big cost and

00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:38,380
share it take it

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,970
sorry take on that be cost and then

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,539
share out the benefits of that amongst

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:47,890
the other users of the system we can

00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:50,440
also enforce standards so if we want to

00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:53,860
say if we want to make sure if there's a

00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,929
dodgy CA SSL certificate we want to get

00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,000
rid of we can and we can help ensure

00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:00,220
that all our products within the company

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,929
have that particular certificate removed

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,970
or that we're all using the same version

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:06,280
of something on can be good think of

00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,900
many reasons you can think of many

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,460
different standards you can enforce if

00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:15,010
you're a middle man between linux and

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,470
customers and finally this one's a bit

00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,909
this one's a bit abstract as well

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:22,510
insulating users from having to make

00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:23,950
hard or unpopular decisions so yeah

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,049
let's let's say you wanted to change

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,780
unit systems in your distribution

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:33,870
I mean how who makes the decision you

00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:36,370
know to change the one system or another

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:40,120
it's a you know whatever decision you

00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:44,190
make people are gonna be upset and in a

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:46,690
kind of in the middle man less system

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,950
individual kind of users might not want

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,890
to make that decision because it's a

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:53,289
hard or it's unpopular but HTML into the

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,809
middleman can make that decision for

00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:57,340
everyone and publicly everyone here one

00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,090
else can say ah we don't like this size

00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,530
but we've got

00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,730
you know we're forced to do it but you

00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,060
know secretly that's what they want at

00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,100
all

00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:08,680
anyway that's an interesting ideas well

00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:11,710
I think okay finally so finally um so

00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,110
what happens when you substitute HP

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,760
debian for HP helix and what happens

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,970
when you sausage it your organization

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,540
for HP e how can you use how can you

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:25,300
sell debian inside your organization

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:27,010
with this middleman and algae they can

00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,020
be good to think about that yeah I think

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,710
the middle the middleman idea is

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:34,270
powerful is powerful way to communicate

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,310
the costs and benefits of Debian within

00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:38,230
an organization because we know it's a

00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:40,150
analogy that people are familiar with

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:44,170
the middlemen are everywhere in society

00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:45,700
and by thinking about Debian the large

00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,650
distribution as a middleman I think you

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:55,390
can help explain things to to other

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:56,860
people quite well okay so finally so my

00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,070
dears in this talk was taken from the

00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:03,280
book called the middleman economy by

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:04,810
marine and a crack offski and she goes

00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,640
into a lot more detail here she breaks

00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,710
middlemen down into six different

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,720
categories which are which I put down

00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,430
there and if you're interested in

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,640
reading about that more it's credible

00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:22,660
books there's lots of examples of this

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:31,630
inside the book thank you everybody

00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:34,780
thank you Jim and sorry for the mess

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,140
over the sizing series is there any

00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,140
questions

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:51,860
I you mentioned that the HP Linux port

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:54,470
started with one internal customer his

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,970
be Helia and then later I think to

00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,870
mention that expand it to a couple of

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:01,220
other customers while the external no

00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,320
they're all internal customers still

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,320
always my distribution would actually

00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,880
mean we're distributing it filling him

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,310
as I understand

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,320
HP is involved in supporting all the

00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:19,220
enterprise advances in the market for

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:23,000
their actual harden buying customers so

00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:26,110
what are the challenges do you face with

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,110
supporting something like Debian for

00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:33,260
federal customers is a demand among your

00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:35,840
customers asking for something like

00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,600
Debian a lot of universities use depend

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,600
on the machines where they buy hardware

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:45,020
from you do they really ask for

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,820
something later yeah PL talked about

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,100
this last year I think and the story was

00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:53,680
people want to know this the report but

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,680
they don't actually want to buy it so

00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:03,440
I'm not sure what the solution to that

00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:05,090
is for that so if you could add a long

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,920
time ago that the right thing to do is

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,290
to make sure that all of the fundamental

00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,870
software required to enable use of

00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:14,390
essentially any distribution of Linux on

00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:17,510
our Hardware ought to be pushed upstream

00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:19,490
and so we work very hard for a number of

00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:22,280
years to get all of the drivers required

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,650
work with all of our platforms into the

00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,270
kernel data or upstream space and then

00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,130
we work with the different distributors

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,200
to make sure that they picked up the

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,450
right hardware nailing pieces and sort

00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,870
of using reason enough kernels to have

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,600
our stuff that we need

00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:39,059
and yet so do you go through formal

00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,250
certification processes with the various

00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,990
commercial enterprise oriented

00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,820
distributions because there are a

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,320
substantial number of our customers that

00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,150
demand one or another of those

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,429
distributions and expect to be able to

00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,950
buy support contracts and all that sort

00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:55,590
of thing what we've observed is that

00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:57,929
what people generally care about is who

00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,039
are running community distributions is

00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:00,809
they want to know that it's going to

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,490
work they want to have some confidence

00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:04,380
that if it doesn't work if there's

00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,330
somebody they can talk to but they

00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,669
generally aren't really interested in

00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,230
buying commercial support contracts or

00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:12,570
if they are they want it to be very

00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,950
tuned to them a consultative kind of way

00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,220
not a sort of shrink-wrap

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:19,110
one-size-fits-all expensive you know per

00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,419
unit per incident or whatever sort of

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,909
things so we have this hybrid approach

00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:26,610
where we work very hard to get all of

00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:28,740
the drivers stuff into the upstream

00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,360
repository so that you don't actually

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,460
have to have you know any sort of

00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,260
special software run and then we

00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,380
actually do test a lot of these things

00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:39,240
but we make different levels assertion

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,850
where if it's a commercial distribution

00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,880
we've actually run through so seriously

00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:46,710
rigorous testing and we've made specific

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,330
courses for contract kinds of

00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,190
commitments around we'll describe that

00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,000
as being supported at this level and

00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:56,549
then there's sort of a broad breadth of

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,010
support for community and non-commercial

00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,630
oriented distributions that mean falls

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,760
into that we know that there are a lot

00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,529
of people running a lot of debt in on a

00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,390
lot of our hardware we think that's

00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:08,850
great customers all things seem to thing

00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:11,580
that's great seems to work great but

00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,820
when you start using words like support

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:17,190
in the context of a company like hte of

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,770
people who do support for a living have

00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,779
really crisp definitions of the

00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,210
difference between compatible and

00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:26,549
supported and tested and all these sorts

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,230
of things and rather than trying to

00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:31,080
explain that to everybody we just so

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,820
shorten them it's gonna work fine and in

00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,950
almost every case everybody hands up

00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:37,990
sort of happy

00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,970
yeah thanks Vito yeah I think customers

00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,280
are very sophisticated these days and

00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:46,929
very knowledgeable about Linux anyways

00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:48,820
yeah I think you support how many people

00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:50,679
in some sense I do a lot of support

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,500
themselves yes I think bit us comment

00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,260
about having a more consulting oriented

00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:10,419
support idea is probably what's

00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:12,970
happening is there any plan to like

00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:16,169
release this to the public I mean crane

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:25,590
I buy a server ProLiant server with this

00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:28,419
then your future there are some still

00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:30,840
unresolved issues in regard to whether

00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:33,100
you actually externally whether we can

00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,600
externally distribute it even though

00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,650
it's just a VM they're still all kind of

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:42,159
legal niceties and things that need to

00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:43,809
go through yeah so I mean listen I don't

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,789
think there is actually any reason why

00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:48,309
we cannot it's just we've got to go

00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:53,730
through the due diligence and marketing

00:30:48,309 --> 00:31:00,130
and legal stuff at approximately correct

00:30:53,730 --> 00:31:03,549
like yes maybe any other questions or

00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:09,169
comments you can excuse Debbie and Jason

00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:11,729
yeah okay

00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:13,799
so Steph said a couple of times what our

00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:18,749
goal really is is to have this be sort

00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:20,429
of slightly branded a subset as possible

00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:22,529
so one of the things are working very

00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:25,769
hard on this to try and minimize the

00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:30,179
Delta between what's in Debian of the

00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:33,059
moment is actually being shipped in and

00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:35,249
so he's not being facetious when he says

00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:37,379
you know the right answer if you want to

00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:40,590
take advantage of our work is actually

00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:43,229
in most cases just on Debian and most of

00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,330
the benefit if you're actually running

00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:47,759
our systems than what you may find is

00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,979
that if you're running one of the

00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,379
software solutions from the company that

00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:54,359
has an embedded Linux kernel on some

00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:56,070
users face you may if you dig under the

00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:58,919
covers to discover that it's actually

00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:01,559
Debian but the internal technology

00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,049
standard was intended to address all of

00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:06,269
the places where we were embedding Linux

00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:07,979
into something that we sell to a

00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:10,039
customer where the customer isn't really

00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:11,909
buying Linux they're buying some

00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:15,119
applications some solutions some

00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:17,190
appliance and if it's got a Linux kernel

00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,019
inside of it then we are trying to

00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,609
consolidate and standardize to minimize

00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:23,249
the cost of doing things like federal

00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:25,470
certifications and security updates all

00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:27,929
on sort of stuff we're not actually

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:29,849
pushing this as a branded distro and

00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:32,820
world because we think if you need a

00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:33,989
full service distro out in the world is

00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,080
already there and it works just great

00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:39,059
this is really you know right now for

00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,700
the next period of time it's all about

00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:43,950
how do we consolidate all the work

00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,979
that's going into various embedded uses

00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,090
of Linux inside of the company and

00:32:45,979 --> 00:32:50,159
there's been lots of discussion about

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:52,139
how like that growers found to be used

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,609
differently over time and it's certainly

00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:55,649
something worth of 10 and the other

00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:57,029
surrounded been doing make sure we have

00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:58,889
all the right container and all the

00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:01,529
pieces and so forth open up some

00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:04,169
interesting strategic opportunities but

00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:06,869
there's a huge big deal when you decide

00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:08,909
to actually enter the marketplace with a

00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:10,349
new distribution and we're not at all

00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:10,930
convinced that the world needs that

00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:14,059
right now

00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,059
[Music]

00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:26,669
okay so any other questions so I guess

00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:28,779
it was sort of one main thing that

00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:30,970
frustrated you in the process and that

00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:33,370
maybe debian could make it easier for

00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:35,770
yourselves or other people looking to do

00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:40,860
something similar then then what would

00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:45,340
that be I don't know probably around

00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:47,140
documentation on the Debian tool so the

00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,380
tooling for doing the uploads and that

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,690
kind of thing I mean I think those of us

00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,850
teeth-gnashing in here pulling over you

00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:57,510
know how it all worked but yeah I mean

00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:00,039
it's I guess it's difficult those tools

00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:02,289
to make them I kind of publish them and

00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:05,049
make them generically available as you

00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:06,460
know product there's a separate package

00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:08,109
because they're just these it's one of

00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,419
the system is used once you know it's

00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:12,399
used inside davian's and I get to be

00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:14,139
harder to take that out and you know

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,619
file off the debian beating stick

00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:22,690
someone else's job yeah fed off my head

00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:33,929
that promotes a good question things so

00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:36,099
any other questions if not then I'm

00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:39,990
really pleased to hear that you are

00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:42,639
known around you are pushing

00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:48,429
contributors towards the games as well

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:52,570
because we hear a lot about HP's people

00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:55,869
terms as well I only do this i Barris

00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:59,680
you but I think we should welcome usw

00:34:55,869 --> 00:35:02,060
developer and they come

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,150
[Applause]

00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:09,350
this is a nice and what do you want to

00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,350
say I don't know

00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:15,739
