so uh and it's gettin miked up I'll tell

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,460
you the story from how this happened

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,469
I'm involved in deep comes because I'm

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,000
very passionate about open hard way and

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,830
I know nothing about hard ways so I

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,029
thought I'll organize a conference and

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:26,670
learn more while organizing this last

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,460
year I met Andy and his crews including

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,099
Steve McIntyre and B Dell and Mad Dog I

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,870
think are also a team that they talks

00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:36,690
and that was my first introduction to it

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,590
this year when Andy came on Saturday we

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,969
did a beer trip I guess a winter brewery

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,910
yeah pretty good

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,370
it was awesome yes so this is just

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,500
between watch over and hermanus and the

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,449
guys the breweries called winning clip

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,489
and the guy brewing at his mark two most

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,539
Hazen I think you need to come here be

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,690
Dell you need to come yet

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,879
do what you can take a seat Yan you

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:05,220
could just pitch in whenever you want

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:06,689
and he runs his brewery online so we

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,070
were talking about how do we get

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,250
involved in open hardware and the

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,689
easiest way is to start with a project

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,580
so I still run I'm busy building a house

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,049
let's make a smart home because then you

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,299
can have hardware and sensors and

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,700
monitors and everything and that really

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:26,119
got Andy annoyed do you want to tell us

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:29,060
why I get really annoyed with silos

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:34,680
people know what I mean by silos you

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:36,150
should throw like blank faces various

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,640
different companies jumping on this

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,909
bandwagon which is being marketed as the

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,460
Internet of Things and what they're

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,079
actually doing is they're trying to get

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,570
you to buy their product and their

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:54,149
product alone and so they have a device

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:58,380
a hub of some description which will

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:00,090
only talk to their own devices or

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,360
devices in their own ecosystem and

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,759
they're their club of friends and they

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,330
tend to stick everything online it goes

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,180
into another buzzword the cloud

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,180
and then two three four years later when

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,880
the little experiment hasn't succeeded

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,920
they drop the server services in the

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,160
cloud and you're left holding a bunch of

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,920
hardware which may or may not continue

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,260
to work that's a bit wrong

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,080
we've bought the hardware we expected it

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,880
to work we've been sold something and it

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,120
doesn't so that's an issue about how

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,920
open open hardware is well this is why

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,880
you we need to open hardware and we need

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,340
open top is the corporates are not doing

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,310
this but then we had this big discussion

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,200
about what is open yes when it comes to

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,020
hard way because hard way has a physical

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,790
thing associate children and there was

00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:58,620
there was a thing about that software

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,360
scales exponentially so once you make it

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,040
available you could really share it but

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,070
there's always a cost associated with

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,800
hard way and that creates a tension with

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,440
how open it is is that correct extent I

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,980
mean you've been involved in in various

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,750
projects that you've done it's not open

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:19,290
genuinely if you push your own design

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,220
out there the reason you've developed to

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,930
the first place is you've got a

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,560
particular rich and you want to scratch

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,860
it so you sit and work on something

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,980
maybe you you color some people who have

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,620
a background in electronics or maybe

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,940
you're experimenting for the first time

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,720
you put something together you get it

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,760
working and you share it with the world

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,810
but in order to get any feedback in

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,239
order to contribute back into that

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,209
project typically you're going to end up

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,220
building hardware which has a physical

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,450
cost particularly if you're

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,260
experimenting on something that you've

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,970
never done before

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,959
and there is also a very long lead time

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,730
with software you can jump straight in

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,080
you can hack around a bit if it doesn't

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,350
work you can blow it away you can try

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,590
again

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,940
with hardware it's to start off with

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,980
that's that's fine you could sit there

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,090
on breadboard you can you can you could

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,980
cobble a few bits and pieces together

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,419
you can let the magic blue smoke out of

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,000
the occasional transistor manifest as

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:23,260
you build something but when you start

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,740
getting to sister

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:29,980
one chip or more more highly integrated

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:33,940
devices then you're putting them on

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:36,960
quite a complicated PCB the lead times

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:41,140
at that PCB manufacturing is quite hard

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,380
um so yeah you need to be working

00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:47,470
together as a group and that got us to

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,020
the or what actually is open is it open

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,340
if you just press your ducky diagram

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,830
yeah there's a bunch of different ways

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,810
to think about this right because on one

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,280
level you know I've been really excited

00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,680
over the last few years with the

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,740
explosion of you know sort of maker

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,660
projects people publishing information

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,400
on the hackaday or wherever else about

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,870
something that they did that they

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,300
thought was interesting they thought was

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,820
cool the problem of course is that a lot

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,340
of these are somebody's first attempt

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,870
ever to do something like this and so on

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,760
one hand it's really exciting to see

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,130
them getting excited and learning how to

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,950
use some sort of building block bits and

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,320
pieces but a lot of things that people

00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,000
come up with are very very far away from

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,640
something that you would want to

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,520
reproduce on Mouse either because it's

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,190
not an efficient way to do it for many

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,020
copies or because there's something

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,490
flaky about it that they're willing to

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,520
deal with in their environment that

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,920
which people who you know are not as

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,210
passionate about the making of the thing

00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,920
might not be willing to tolerate

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:52,030
potentially we've got a series of

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,800
standards and localized legislation you

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,780
have to comply with and then the hacker

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,550
ethic and the maker culture have always

00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,860
been sort of tied up in figuring out how

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,930
to use what's easily available to you to

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,640
do something that maybe the people who

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,560
design those bits didn't originally

00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,300
envisioned and while that's really

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,900
really cool it doesn't always scale very

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,390
well and so in my experience the thing

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,670
that people end up sort of stumbling

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,010
with is how do you go from something

00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:20,260
that's easy to do in a one-off kind of

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,660
way to something that you could

00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,520
replicate and the way that would be you

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,830
know very broadly applicable and lots of

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,720
people could take advantage of in fact

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,780
with the avionic stuff that keith and i

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,760
work on the thing that i think has

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,490
caused us to be successful selling

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,310
rocket avionics

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,950
is that the stuff we build is actually

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,920
pretty complicated to make physically

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:46,290
it's you know very fine pick surface

00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,060
mount technology and that's not nearly

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,190
as scary as a lot of folks think it is

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,380
but to do them and sort of have them be

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:55,920
reliable does take a certain amount of

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,360
experimentation and expertise on the

00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,300
circuit boards themselves I mean they're

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,260
not each got to the point where but me

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,970
realistically you're not going to build

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,530
those yourself you're going you're going

00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,140
to go to send that away to a third-party

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,460
company but even more importantly the

00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,410
average person playing around with

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,330
high-power rocketry has something else

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,580
that's their primary focus yeah Keith

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,830
and for me it's really rocketry these

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,390
days is a lot about the electronics and

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,710
the telemetry and the kind of data we

00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,410
can collect in the ways we can help

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,120
other people particularly students being

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,550
able to do cool things that they

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,020
couldn't do otherwise but we have a lot

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,169
of friends who are really good at making

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,490
propellant and their thing is all about

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,919
changing the chemistry of the propellant

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,210
and they almost would like for somebody

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,560
else to build the rocket and they

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,870
certainly don't want to have to design

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,220
and build circuit board and you've got

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,110
off it and you've got the hobby flyest

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,700
who wants to buy an airframe and buy

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,350
your slider kits right by the propeller

00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,540
possibly also you've got the makings of

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,700
a complete community right so the the

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,280
the place that this gets really hard

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,220
though so you talk about smart home

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,160
things you're absolutely right that

00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,140
every major company out there that would

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,360
like to play in that consumer space

00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,040
wants to figure out the thing that's

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,950
going to cause their products to be

00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,540
sticky and desirable to customers and a

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,280
lot of times that means that if they

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,270
have their preference they would build

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,860
everything with some sort of a

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,240
proprietary local protocol and they

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,700
would Gateway to the Internet at one

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,290
place there are a couple of working

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,729
groups that the Linux Foundation now

00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,800
that are trying to fight against that

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:24,390
and trying to build industry consensus

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,910
on standardizing some of these protocols

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,729
and if you really care about that stuff

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,680
at the sort of trying to shape the way

00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:33,240
the market works level those would be

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,849
good places to go get involved and try

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,680
and drive thinking and behavior the

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,680
problem of course is that that's it's

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,050
sort of a macro industrial level right

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,209
and so what do you do yourself well I

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,110
just finished building a green house for

00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:51,339
my wife to replace the one we lost and

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:54,579
fire and 2013 and it's got a thermal

00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:56,170
control system and shockingly that's all

00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:58,120
done using open hardware and software

00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,620
bits I did cheat a little bit it's not a

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,269
hundred percent open because there is a

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,490
Raspberry Pi in the middle of it and

00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,519
that still has one little binary blob I

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,769
believe but you know the control

00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,720
algorithm is about a page of Python that

00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:13,839
I cobbled together from bits and pieces

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,420
the sensors are simple things that are

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,100
tacked onto GPIO lines the controls are

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,040
a couple of cheap Chinese solid state

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,420
relays that I bought through Amazon and

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,700
you know there's a fan and electrically

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,190
operated louvers to open the vents and a

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,339
four kilowatt electric heater sitting in

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,160
the middle of it so and and the really

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,480
amusing part is I found some lovely

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,370
temperature and humidity and

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,019
environmental control plotting stuff

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,029
that was written by somebody in a

00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,850
marijuana grow facility somewhere in

00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:45,339
Colorado it's legal now and there's this

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,680
whole sub community of people sort of

00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,870
encouraging each other to build more

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,399
robust infrastructure for growing

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:56,110
marijuana so Maria's just immunised when

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,810
I found this cute little chunk of code

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,760
for you know creating web plots of

00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,839
environmental data and that's where it

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,720
came from

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,370
and of course since it is for greenhouse

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,750
project there's been lots of joking

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,730
around the family about what my wife's

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:14,050
actually growing in there no no no there

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,910
are plenty of people who are really good

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,010
at that in Colorado and frankly I would

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,779
much rather have components for salsa so

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,959
there are poblanos and Serrano's and all

00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:25,000
kinds of herbs and tomatoes yeah it's a

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,079
it's a it's a salsa greenhouse they're

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,949
coming back to the greenhouse so this

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:36,100
totally bespoke no I bought Dallas TS 18

00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:38,470
beaches so look I'm I do electronics for

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,269
fun and you know I used to do it for a

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,440
living

00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:46,089
and despite Keith's beliefs I am

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,199
actually capable of writing software

00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:49,199
myself from time to time

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,560
well I did this time I'll even show you

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,270
the code if you wanna see it it's the

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,890
first time I've written I started with

00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,750
like an empty edit buffer and created

00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,130
like a whole page of Python myself it's

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,530
kind of exciting

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,960
I thought you can solve sort of an

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,120
executive these days right but no I mean

00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,710
it's fun because simple temperature

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,150
sensor is one of our temperature sensors

00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,650
somebody else had written a library that

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,430
talks to those sensors on the PI that

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,140
was easy

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,050
this all state relays come on people I'm

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,880
wiggling a GPIO on how hard can it be it

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,550
turns out in pipelining Avant it was

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,860
another library so whatever but it all

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:26,160
works just brilliantly and it took me in

00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,740
a one afternoon to go from getting

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,930
hardware also to put together and by the

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,370
way if you're interested yes of course

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,500
like all of my things that's not open

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,240
hardware design and this I do actually

00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,980
have a schematic for what I wired up

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,200
around the PI and I have not bothered

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,060
pushing it out to my web yet because I

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,680
was busy off playing with my parents and

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,770
a good friend during a rocket sort last

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,030
weekend instead so so so this fits in

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,820
really worked nicely was what we're

00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,650
talking on Saturday and it came down to

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,360
that things need to be appropriate for

00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,860
what you're doing like sometimes a

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,540
really simple thing it was just a page

00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,570
of Python code is really all you need

00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,340
and I think that would wear to entry my

00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,440
wife is so happy with the fact that the

00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,540
green house control systems just work on

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,400
it it's not look it's not complicated

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,380
code and I say that in part cuz I used

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,910
to write you know factory floor

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,740
automation could and things like this

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:17,010
back in the days of my misspent youth

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,380
but it really it's not complicated and

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,790
if anyone here who's ever looked at

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,800
Python before we'd look at probably

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,930
laugh at my cupboard but you would

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,910
immediately see just how simple the

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,700
problem is we're trying to solve so yes

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:32,460
I think on one level what I would love

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,740
to see is lots more people encouraged to

00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,480
not get hung up about who they have to

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,040
devise stuff from and to realize that

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,260
some of the things you want to do for

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,780
yourself you really can do for yourself

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,430
by yourself and it's actually a lot of

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,420
fun hacking around with little bits of

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,560
hardware and software please Mike but at

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,990
the other end of the spectrum I think

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,830
it's really important for us to realize

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:58,530
that there is this huge mechanism

00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,970
involved in turning good ideas into

00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,909
mass-produced hardware

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,889
and the support that's required for

00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:06,749
someone like you know my mother or your

00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,689
grandmother or whoever to be able to

00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:11,689
call on Sunday night and get help

00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:14,069
figuring out why the thing doesn't work

00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:16,819
and those are the sorts of things that

00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:19,859
cause you to have to stop and ponder

00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:21,179
where the threshold is between the stuff

00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:23,129
that you really want and need to have

00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:24,720
open versus the stuff that you're

00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:27,119
willing to let somebody have some

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,949
mechanism for generating some kind of a

00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:31,739
revenue stream right so in a team

00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:33,720
discussion over there we came up with

00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:37,529
four things about what it means to be

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,909
open this was also after many beers so

00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:43,739
you know I would like some feedback it

00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:46,139
got to be heated so what does it mean to

00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:49,139
be open it means to be accessible to be

00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,729
hackable to give a how-to manual the

00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,619
hard way to say what they did and how

00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:57,929
the user could do the same thing so

00:13:52,619 --> 00:14:01,049
basically explaining how no talking

00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:03,059
about in absolute perfect ideal world so

00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:05,039
in your ideal world if you if you've got

00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:06,539
something you want to stop there's

00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,069
enough information somebody else to pick

00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:11,279
it up and learn my answer to that is

00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:13,619
actually yes to be open you have to have

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,749
some kind of documentation even if all

00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,129
it is is an assertion of which open

00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:20,189
standards you're compliant with or

00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:21,749
something like that and and see from my

00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:25,470
perspective schematics and source code

00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:28,049
of our documentation so yeah so could we

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,269
get to schematics can I do to my points

00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:31,919
just to finish my fault of course you're

00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:34,019
open is about the idea that you can at

00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,939
least try to reproduce something doesn't

00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,859
matter how hard it is you at least have

00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:39,689
the ability to get in there and try and

00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:42,749
to share your design and let other

00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:44,519
people comment on that design so

00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:46,919
reproducibility is certainly one

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,629
potential attribute of open but it's not

00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,119
actually the attribute that and most

00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,949
people care about most of the time as

00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:55,019
most people don't actually want to have

00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:57,089
to build the thing themselves when it

00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,639
comes to physical hardware what most

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:01,739
people want is the knowledge the shore

00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,929
knowledge the assertion the guarantee

00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:05,819
that if they spend money buying a piece

00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:07,739
of hardware that somebody else doesn't

00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:08,240
have the ability to control when it

00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,999
becomes

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,619
so we'd and you know in a perfect world

00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:14,059
you'd buy a piece of hardware that had a

00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:16,009
completely open design whose

00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:17,509
documentation came with schematics and

00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:19,189
bills material and things like this you

00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:22,100
know like Gila Packard oscilloscopes

00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:24,470
used to back in the 1970s a double-dip

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,550
it's much a complete theory of operation

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,470
in the back so that you could actually

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,110
repair your own instrumentation that's

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:33,889
lovely point in history I'm fortunate to

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,480
have been around that the what they

00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,889
really care about is that you know

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,749
somebody else going out of business

00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:41,089
doesn't all of a sudden make their home

00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:42,679
control systems stop working I'll be

00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:47,089
honest with you the things I worry more

00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:49,220
about our recent proliferation of

00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:53,089
devices that depend upon some piece of

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,439
cloud infrastructure like it's like oh

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:55,850
well that's really cute and it does this

00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:57,319
really cool thing and I don't have to

00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,999
put any infrastructure together I just

00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:00,470
buy six of these and put them down and

00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,209
hey look you know I can point my phone

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,279
at some random website now I can see

00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:06,709
what's going on in my house yeah I mean

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,300
never mind the security implications of

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:10,459
all of that okay and we can talk about

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,619
that in this group for the whole week

00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:14,299
I'm sure but just think about what

00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:16,009
happens if that company goes belly-up

00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:17,929
and that website goes what's not even

00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:22,399
when two companies belly-up I mean we've

00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:24,110
already seen examples of I kept me from

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,179
I think it was one of the Google control

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,939
systems where they no longer support the

00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:30,499
montón API so people who have gone on

00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:33,079
put their heating system their lighting

00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:35,449
controllers and bits and pieces in the

00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:37,399
hardware works absolutely fine but the

00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:39,019
cloud services have gone and so that is

00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:44,240
where standard an industry standard

00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:48,139
could come in place to secure yeah you

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,439
could then change your circuit something

00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,639
else

00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:53,449
so again this is where to me the

00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,860
definition of open is complicated

00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:56,959
because it sort of depends on what

00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,549
you're trying to accomplish a lot of

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,350
time what I really care about is making

00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:01,519
sure that if I think something is cool

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,649
enough that I'm willing to put some of

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,230
my hard-earned money down that it's not

00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,179
gonna somehow become unmaintainable or

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,610
unsupportable later that to me is one of

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:13,130
the biggest the freedom and in fact this

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,809
is the thing for those who weren't there

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,230
or haven't heard about it I gave a talk

00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:20,059
at was it this year yes it was this year

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,680
when X conference Australia about the

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:25,340
whole house audio system I don't

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,680
for a new house and you know I my

00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,410
contractor we were building the house we

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,610
told them we wanted the undistributed

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,280
high quality audio through this or

00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:36,200
background audio stuff and you know

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,930
music in whichever room wanted it kind

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,820
of thing and they suspect a really cool

00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,400
looking system fairly high-end

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,160
ridiculously expensive but irrelevant

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,570
for this part of the discussion the

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,300
feature so it was pretty cool

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,160
you know I had apps for you know your

00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,050
iOS or Android device order you could

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,330
use to control it and all this sort of

00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,700
stuff the problem was being the connect

00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,260
I am I went and did a little quick due

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,420
diligence on the manufacturers website

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,020
and I couldn't find any documentation

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:08,840
about what the console contents of the

00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,940
system were I found sort of an owner's

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,040
manual operators manual and then I went

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,140
to the support pages on the website and

00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,600
buried down in there were a couple of

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,760
screenshots of what the administrative

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,780
interface to the box looked like and

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,940
there were terms in use on the screen

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,160
that were unique to the way you

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,170
configure network filtering and Linux

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,120
kernel so does that come back to your

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:35,060
schematics conversation and so when I

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,380
looked at this I went oh this this is

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,330
like a ninety nine point nine nine

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,830
something percent probability there's a

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,670
Linux kernel inside this thing there's

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:45,980
not a single mention the GPO anywhere

00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:48,380
now in theory you know until I actually

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,780
buy a box from them they're not

00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,180
obligated to provide me anything under

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,710
the GPL right so in theory I could maybe

00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,380
have spent a lot of money and bought the

00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,670
product and when it arrived maybe it

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,230
would have come with source code maybe

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,640
it would have come with documentation of

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,370
a written offer or something like this

00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,230
but my expectation based on the way the

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,760
rest of the material was crafted is I

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,860
would spend a lot of money and be really

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,900
unhappy at the end of the day both

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:15,350
because it appeared to me to be a

00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,060
blatant GPL violation and because they

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,130
were wrapping it all up as a proprietary

00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,080
thing and not documenting any of this or

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,970
telling me about the guts which I might

00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,620
like to play with so of course I

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,720
rebelled I am designing a cute little

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,290
board that's sort of USB 2 30 watt

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,940
stereo audio I built up nine of them

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,890
mounted them on a strip and put them up

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,350
on the wall and what a cheap Chinese

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,150
power supply which by the way require it

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,740
I buy an equivalently expensive ball

00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:42,460
bearing fan to make the power supply

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,020
possible to live with at night I wish

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,370
you know another nickel spent on the

00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,500
bearings in the fan would have saved me

00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:50,290
a lot of hassle and there's actually a

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,050
little Intel what's the thing called

00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:57,340
it's one and then I know it's called

00:19:53,050 --> 00:20:03,310
it's the it's one of their little single

00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:05,710
board computers that uses atom a that's

00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:08,260
not the name of it but whatever it's a

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,610
little Intel Architecture based embedded

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,830
board that's just sitting there running

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,690
Debian and hacked up version of moppet

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,570
II and my wife's really really happy but

00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:19,030
here's an example of where even before I

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,500
purchased it it occurred to me to care

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,990
about these things and I went and looked

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,060
and it was not hard for me to you know I

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,890
didn't get absolute proof that there was

00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,230
a problem but I certainly wasn't left

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,600
with a warm fuzzy ago spend $12,000 on

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,520
their hardware and in fact I think the

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,860
hardware cost of my solution even if I'd

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,360
had to buy the little Intel board would

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:44,230
have been on the order of like 200 bucks

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:45,930
so yes exactly and for me of course this

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,220
is this is the Hobby part of it right

00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,870
this is why I was saying earlier this is

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,430
the thing that sort of differentiates

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:54,730
those of us here I mean all of us enjoy

00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:58,120
hacking on stuff or we wouldn't be

00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:00,640
involved in Debian on some level and I

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,410
suspect most of you in this room full

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,770
audio boards yes there was some serious

00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:06,850
electronic design part of that and I

00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,260
will take credit for the fact that

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,980
that's not something anybody could just

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,870
go do trivially but there are lots of

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,160
projects like this where you really

00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,460
could go do a little bit of it but

00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,730
there's a huge distance between I can do

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,810
this once and make it work for me and

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,350
what does it take to actually deliver

00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:29,020
something in industrial Vons

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:31,510
Keith I struggle figuring out how to get

00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,340
an economical production run done of a

00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,800
tiny little thing at thousand unit

00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,750
quantities they're just the the

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,070
logistics I mean you know you you get

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,740
done with the designing of a working

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,360
prototype and

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,450
you have to do the other 90% of the work

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,230
oh yeah I mean that's my day job so I'm

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:50,809
and and so on some level I have sympathy

00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:53,510
for people who want to find some way to

00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,460
hook you to ensure that once you they've

00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,750
spent a lot of money investing and

00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,940
developing all that that they have some

00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,160
way to recoup that investment but that's

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,710
something the Theia does not extend as

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,170
far as you can lock me out of the

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,900
ability to have control over the life

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,550
cycle of that in my own use and to me

00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,610
that's the really important thing is do

00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:15,710
I or did someone else control what the

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,840
life cycle is this is gonna be so you

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,679
one of the things we said was

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,740
documentation we said you know a

00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,420
schematic is a good start point and

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,660
knowledge of the api's is a really good

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:29,809
start point but working on an open I

00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,840
don't open hardware project do you just

00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:35,510
give the schematic and say that's it as

00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,240
a team project we just give the

00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:40,220
schematic away and that's enough or do

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,210
we need to give more than just the

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,260
schematic I mean the number of projects

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:50,480
that I've seen which are electrically

00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:53,240
open and the schematic is a PDF it's

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,620
yeah I've got a circuit diagram they

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,200
give away they might give away some

00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,710
gathers if you're if your purpose is to

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,510
ensure that someone else can write code

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,770
their works with that hardware then a

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,860
schematic might suffice

00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:08,330
yeah on the other hand I suspect that

00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,200
even if you have the schematics of a

00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,820
tivo you still would need the keys to

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,970
cryptographically sign the kernel before

00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,280
the service would actually function for

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,059
you and so it really again it kind of

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,030
depends on what you need

00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:25,400
Keith and I make schematics and Gerber's

00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:27,200
and drill files and build material stuff

00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,309
available for all of our designs and we

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,620
know that that's sufficient because

00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:33,200
we've had people come up to us at rocket

00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,030
launches with clones of our products

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,740
asking us for some little sheepishly

00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,420
asking if we would be willing to help

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,040
them with the one little thing they

00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,090
didn't quite understand let's just got

00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:46,250
somebody's coming up to you they've

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:48,050
bought a clone overboard that you've

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,190
designed time they've made of comes

00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,510
they've made it they've made it

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,190
themselves I think okay that's a

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,780
definite downloaded the Gerber's and

00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,280
drove

00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,990
they set them off to a board shop they

00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,730
have raw boards made they downloaded our

00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,460
bill of materials which has all of the

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,900
distributor part numbers and everything

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,030
digit key and Mouser part numbers think

00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,770
of us and they placed orders and bought

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,990
the parts and they sat down and place

00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,090
them all themselves and refloat it in a

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,650
electric skillet or something and they

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,910
turn it on and it kind of seemed to work

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,560
and they don't understand why they can't

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,060
hear the RF in it's just because they

00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,540
didn't know they need to calibrate the

00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:22,030
frequency but give in on your face when

00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,650
somebody comes up with yeah yes so as

00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,450
keith was saying earlier I don't think

00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,490
the first person who did that to us was

00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,740
expecting our response which was immense

00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,450
Glee we were so ecstatic that somebody

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,530
had actually like built a corner of one

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,650
of the things because it was proof

00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:38,890
positive that our assertions that were

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:40,420
open hardware guys it was true so it's

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:43,450
not just check it on the internet on

00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:45,790
your website Hezbollah his his my that

00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,230
my files and nobody looks at it people

00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,640
are actually going out there

00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,310
they're searching this when when the

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,580
website when the search engine but all

00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:56,140
holy site I don't know in this case if

00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,360
it's as much that or as much people

00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,560
along with somebody else playing oh

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,880
that's really cool and they go looking

00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,980
like oh wow this is open I've always

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,780
wanted to learn how to like place parts

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,460
and reflow surface mount myself here's a

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,750
known working design I can start from

00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,670
it'll be something really cool to play

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:15,400
with when I'm done I don't know exactly

00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:16,780
what the motivations are so we take some

00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,240
questions comments from the audience

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:21,640
yeah it'd be much more interesting yeah

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:27,700
I think Sam's got the first one

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:31,560
something I hope Mike Huckabee it's on

00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:35,080
good fun okay um so Sam Hartman I guess

00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,820
you know this is all great that you here

00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,320
is this wonderful discussion of open

00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:43,720
hardware I'm a software guy I would love

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,840
to have control of the lifecycle stuff

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,720
like details talking about but like even

00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,730
really cooking something up to a GPIO

00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,980
line is actually a little bit more than

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:56,440
I'm going to easily be able to do that's

00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:59,830
okay I call my kernel code oh ya know

00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:03,640
right but how do I like how would I go

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:05,750
about let's say I wanted to have a you

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,000
know home audience nobody really

00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:10,970
totally awesome I'm happy to handle the

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,690
software side of it what are my options

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:20,030
for getting something that meets Bedales

00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:21,260
open lifecycle requirement how's the

00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,730
Keith and I were talking on the flight

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:27,500
down about whether I should build and

00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:29,990
sell some of my audio board so yeah it's

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,000
get it fine find that community find the

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,350
people who are already doing it and look

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,120
what they're doing so I think the

00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,970
challenge is when you go looking for

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,920
components to put together to create the

00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,960
system you ought to be asking these

00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,670
questions about all the components

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,560
you're picking and by components you

00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,210
know I could be talking about you know a

00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,550
server I could be talking about you know

00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,860
some integrated sensor box or something

00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:53,390
and and there's different levels of

00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,230
openness and this is what I think I was

00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,120
trying to get to earlier it really

00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,100
depends on what you're trying to do for

00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,040
some people knowing that I can put this

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,560
on the net and it speaks I pee and if I

00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,700
ask it a query in this particular format

00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,320
I'll get the temperature and the

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,840
humidity and the barometric pressure and

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,490
all of that back is open enough they

00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,690
don't actually care about the schematic

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,250
what they want to know is that they can

00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,200
talk to that box with their own

00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,210
computing infrastructure and Sam you

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,100
know that might be the sort of threshold

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,860
that it meets what you're talking about

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,990
but it in in other places in the

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,670
spectrum there are people you know going

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,050
back to our rocket avionics stuff Keith

00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,060
not have been totally thrilled that

00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,980
there are high school teams and college

00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,930
teams that are taking our designs and

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,010
hacking the firmware and adding

00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:39,200
additional sensors and you know part of

00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:41,090
the cool thing about being totally open

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,730
like this and willing to talk to people

00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:46,220
about what we've done is we're enabling

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:48,200
other people to then sort of explicitly

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,750
go build on top of that and sort of use

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,850
our stuff is the big piece at the middle

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,310
of the erector set or the the Lego set

00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,350
or whatever and and that's just

00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:59,060
immensely cool it's immensely gratifying

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:03,020
and you know at this age and stage of my

00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:05,000
life seeing people learn from what we've

00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:09,710
done is almost as gratifying as anything

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,450
else we do so for sofas are suggesting

00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,760
then fine fine find a community of

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,410
people are already doing I much at this

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,550
will do a little research before you

00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:19,550
whip your wallet out

00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:21,230
yep before spending money you know make

00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,780
conscious decisions about the stuff

00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:27,020
you're buying if you buy it because it's

00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,430
shiny and you know I guess you get what

00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:32,170
you got and two weeks tell me won't be

00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:32,170
available anymore so yeah hard to say

00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:39,200
anybody else I still love to get a ham

00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,030
radio flea markets when I was younger

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,370
because it was really exciting to find

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,930
some sort of one-off random piece of

00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,880
stuff and take it home and sort of

00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,890
reverse-engineer it figure it out and do

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,320
something really cool with it yeah I

00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,600
have to admit that at this later stage

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,610
in my life I don't find that nearly as

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,860
exciting as I do figuring out how to

00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,870
create something that satisfies one of

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,150
my own personal needs and desires and

00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:05,270
enables other people to be able to

00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:07,790
network me trying to find the thrill of

00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:10,750
taking something I myself have done some

00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:13,460
ham radio stuff and I do find that

00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:16,880
technology has moved so far forwards now

00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:20,480
that it's getting harder and harder to

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:24,320
understand available because everything

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,370
games and SOC it's got higher and higher

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,820
level of integration and it's getting

00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:34,610
harder to produce or hack on something

00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,590
because it is now just so what I would I

00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,690
would actually argue that with you it's

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:41,510
absolutely true that my I have I have

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,100
friends in Cuba that years ago when they

00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,530
came to a conference in the US I sent

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,450
them Hamas a tube full of many circuits

00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:49,760
EE valance mixers and some oscillator

00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,740
chips and things like this and I knew

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,330
that every sort of set of rough

00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,220
components I sent home would get one

00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:57,410
more person on the fiftyish megahertz

00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,730
six quatre band and that was a totally

00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,800
cool thing to do but at the other end of

00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:02,540
the spectrum I have a bunch of friends

00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,320
in ham radio world who all just went in

00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:07,790
on the crowd supply lime SDR

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,700
software-defined radio boards I mean

00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:13,640
that's that's a very complex piece of

00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,340
kit but it is completely documented

00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,160
schematics artwork all that stuff is has

00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,990
been released and everyone I know that's

00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,650
buying one of those wants to hack on it

00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:27,080
is interested in writing radio code you

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,790
know software and they're gonna hook a

00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,740
couple antennas up to it and that

00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,990
a building block that they're using and

00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,150
the fact that most of them don't

00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,430
actually really care about the details

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,260
of the hardware or what it takes to lay

00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:41,390
out a circuit board so that it's got

00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:45,890
fidelity from 100 kilohertz the 3.8

00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:49,940
gigahertz but this again it so depending

00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:52,250
if so I think it could as seen the same

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,250
thing from different viewpoints is if

00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,810
you want to hack on something and change

00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,390
its functionality from a software point

00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,710
of view the the higher integration is

00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,420
fine providing you've got you've got

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,430
access to it right if you're wanting to

00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:07,550
hack on something from purely as a

00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,800
hardware to experiment to play and

00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:12,110
actually understand the hardware that's

00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,770
getting harder on off-the-shelf products

00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:17,450
because they are more more integrated

00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:20,060
you know if you're wanting something for

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:22,250
longevity but it's interesting because

00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,980
on the flip side the availability of

00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:27,110
well-documented SOC s is now allowing

00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,400
makers to build things that they

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,700
couldn't have ever built before yeah

00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,750
yeah so I'm so sorry I completely hear

00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,640
what you're saying and it's very

00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,830
interesting that after the fire when I

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,870
went to rebuild my RF test bench

00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,970
I found myself buying test equipment

00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:43,820
mostly that was designed in the 1980s

00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:45,950
and the reason is that was about as

00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,780
recent as you can go when things are

00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,790
still really general-purpose I mean I

00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,740
bought a vector network analyzer and I

00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,810
bought a spectrum analyzer that just

00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,150
allow you to look at the RF yeah

00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:58,490
since then the thing that's become

00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:00,950
really cool is to put more and more

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:03,350
levels of abstraction and sophistication

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:06,440
on top of that so now if you go buy an

00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:09,170
RF analyzer you sort of need to go in

00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,420
knowing am I gonna use this for looking

00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:14,120
at GPRS am I gonna use this for look you

00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,620
know what what what radio thing am I

00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,120
trying to do and what protocols do I

00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,320
care about because what the vendors want

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,230
to sell you is something that's

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:25,760
optimized for helping you understand a

00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:27,290
deeper slice through a taller stack that

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,020
you're buying you can't actually just

00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:31,880
look at the spectrum from DC 226 I think

00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,610
you're also buying is a is a is a broad

00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,860
range sensor yes and it gets straight

00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,300
into the digital main and yeah and it is

00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,670
processed it software on the flip side

00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,700
today you can go to somewhere like seed

00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,100
studio and buy

00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,049
little digital signal oscilloscope or

00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,149
digital sampling oscilloscope or a

00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:50,250
little logic analyzer board for 50 bucks

00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:52,470
or something that will allow you to

00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,029
diagnose and troubleshoot things that I

00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,960
could not have afforded the test

00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:58,409
equipment for in 1986 that's so it goes

00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,710
both ways

00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:04,380
great so closing statement where do you

00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,909
think hardware's going open hardware is

00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,230
going in the next couple of years or

00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:08,760
anything else you would like to close

00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,669
the station I'm really excited that

00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,669
they're now a number of companies in the

00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:17,159
world that are making a point of being

00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:19,529
open hardware companies that are north

00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:22,139
of 10 million a year in revenue I either

00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:24,000
like becoming real companies I'm

00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:25,620
personally really pleased to be on the

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
board of directors of Aleph objects

00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,070
which is the parent company of Lowell

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,539
spot who provided the 3d printer stuff

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,519
that you see out in the hall

00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:34,110
in fact my son is working there this

00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,909
summer so I have a fair amount of

00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,679
connection with them and by the way I

00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:40,289
had nothing to do with the fact that

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,360
they sent hardware that's immensely cool

00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:44,580
and done on their own part but I think

00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,110
we are now seeing enough examples of

00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,960
real companies they're being really

00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:51,809
successful following a truly open model

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,380
to believe that they're not just random

00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:57,090
unicorns that this is a structural model

00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,200
that can work but I would think what

00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,840
beginning to see it's in the commercial

00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,539
space but but I think so far we've only

00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,380
seen it work in specialty kinds of

00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:09,270
product spaces it would be really nice

00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,060
to think it's gonna ripple out more you

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:14,849
know but when I can go into a retail

00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:17,639
outlet and have my choice of open design

00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:19,649
Wi-Fi access points or open design home

00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,260
automation pieces then I'll be a

00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,940
believer right now I think there's a

00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,010
whole bunch of hurdles left before the

00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,659
industry at large understands that they

00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,730
can be more open and still make money

00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,310
and of the hobbyist points of view well

00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,409
well we know well I personally you know

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,899
everything i hack on at home is over

00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:44,520
I just life's too short for secrets or

00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:46,109
software and you it's I did I pretty

00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,220
much agree entirely with me that all

00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:50,450
this

00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:53,720
perhaps I'm still seeing from the

00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:56,810
hacking side for um individuality but

00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,609
we're open hardware is I still think

00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:01,040
twenty years behind the open software

00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:03,470
movement we're still in the shareware

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:08,990
stage we're just beginning to come out

00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:13,070
of shareware start to see collaborative

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:16,099
projects but finding them is still few

00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:17,900
and far between I guess the other thing

00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:19,880
I would think about is that a lot of

00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,550
things that used to be perceived as

00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,770
really difficult complex manufacturing

00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:27,320
processes are now available in job shop

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,240
for him not only are there places to

00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,530
make spaces that's like yeah but I mean

00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,599
they're companies now where you can

00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:36,740
upload a design file and get back laser

00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:38,420
cut or 3d printed or CNC machine parts

00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,030
and one-offs it costs some money but I

00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,470
mean you can design PCBs as well may

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,510
dispense it yeah different circuit

00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,980
boards if you want to get raw circuit

00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,390
boards if you want to give somebody

00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,089
building materials and have them do

00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:52,040
surface mount assembly so by the way

00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:53,690
there's job opportunities on both sides

00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,369
of that you know you can find another

00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,079
niche that somebody's not filling and go

00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:58,640
provide a service like that become an

00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:01,250
expert on something and on the front

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,640
side it's actually more possible to hack

00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:06,770
than it used to be there we go

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,280
one last question yeah one question I've

00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,280
enjoyed

00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:22,360
do we need IO to look I mean you get to

00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:24,190
decide what level I'm a universal

00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,470
platform I don't know that I care so

00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:28,960
much about our landing on a singular one

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:31,000
of anything as much as I care about the

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,130
things that we end up adopting on mass

00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,490
having some degree of openness

00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:39,040
I mean why pick is concerned with IOT

00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:41,770
isn't necessarily even openness it's to

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,370
come the massive commercial pressures to

00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:48,700
have your sensors and actuators so cheap

00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:54,130
that any semblance of security goes out

00:36:48,700 --> 00:37:02,260
the window and people who are peddling

00:36:54,130 --> 00:37:43,180
those sort of sensors at home do not

00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:45,040
care about any type so there are at

00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,080
least two working groups at the Linux

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,300
Foundation that are tackling open

00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,760
protocols for IOT space and they have a

00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,770
long list of corporate participants I

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,150
would strongly suggest you go take a

00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:58,020
look at those projects and see what's

00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:00,250
happening because those are places where

00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,410
people who are passionate about it and

00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,840
have some knowledge and interest can

00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:07,240
actually help define the standards that

00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,430
industries will end up adopt great and

00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,470
on that point yeah I hope that this

00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:14,860
creates a lot more conversation in the

00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:17,050
corridors and throughout the week if I'm

00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,850
not too busy we'll talk okay and I want

00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,730
to thank you very much for joining me on

00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,790
this path great I could

00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,790
