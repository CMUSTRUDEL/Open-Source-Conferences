hope you had a good time so far and our

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,130
keynote speaker today is Karen Sandler

00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:11,280
she'll be talking about companies free

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,690
software new Karen is the executive

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,450
director of the software freedom

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,440
Conservancy and she used to be the

00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,710
executive director of the chrome

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,350
foundation and she's also working a lot

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,699
on the outreach program for women and

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:32,009
some what other programs I guess so

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:34,200
everybody please welcome Karen thanks so

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,719
much I am I can't even tell you how

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,210
beyond excited I am to be at Deb Kampf I

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:44,129
was like briefly at the new york.com

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,410
and I was like so impressed and

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,660
enthralled by debian that I kind of ran

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:54,300
away and so all these years later it's

00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:58,469
so exciting to be here and and being a

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,329
speaker so I'm executive director of

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,180
Conservancy raise your hand if you've

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,760
heard of Conservancy so that's almost

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:11,340
everyone hooray um we're we're a

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,840
non-profit charitable fiscal sponsorship

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,659
organization so these are all of our

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:21,720
member projects if you're here you are

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:24,810
surely using a few of them and two of

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,439
the member projects that are not listed

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,780
here include the GPL compliance project

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,610
for Linux kernel developers and also the

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,170
Debbie and copyright aggregation project

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,600
and I'll talk a little bit about those

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:41,729
in a bit so I'm also a lawyer which one

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,790
I admit I often have to hide behind the

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,759
podium most people throw rotten fruit at

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,380
me but but I've only do a pro bono legal

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,280
work and I do volunteer at a spa

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,509
l'interieur Software Foundation and

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,560
kinome and a few other free software

00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,689
organizations I am really really into

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
free software and

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,950
and the reason why I'm really into free

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,580
software for many reasons but but

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,209
largely because I'm a cyborg I have I

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,160
actually literally have a big heart my

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,550
heart is three times the size of a

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,980
normal person's heart and it's fine I'm

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,769
mostly asymptomatic it's not a big deal

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,459
but I'm at a very high risk of suddenly

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:32,840
dying the the medical term is actually

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:34,340
sudden death and and it's 2 to 3 percent

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,349
per year

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,330
compounding that my risk of suddenly

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,970
dying and I was diagnosed at age 30 and

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,709
so it's like a very high risk of

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:49,049
suddenly dying but it's all fine because

00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:53,549
my doctors prescribed a pacemaker

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:55,380
defibrillator and when they like when

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,459
you go to the doctor's office and they

00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,760
tell you that you need one of these

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:02,099
things they like the

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,110
electrophysiologists have like these

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,819
devices in their desk drawers so the

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,959
medical device companies give them like

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,700
a stack of them they're extremely

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,060
expensive I got the bill for mine it was

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,420
I think it was something like $75,000

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,980
u.s. oh and so they they have them in

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,590
their drawer they slide them over to you

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,850
because they want you to hold them and

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,440
to know that they're so small and

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,079
they're so light and they're not scary

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,329
and so they're like you know hold this

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,880
so I take it and I hold it and I'm

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,620
looking at it and the the doctors

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:37,130
looking at me like right this is okay

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,130
right and I say okay so what does it run

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,130
the guy looked at me and said run and I

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,500
said oh yes and I explained their

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,700
software in this device and we haven't

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,840
blow back and forth and he said well

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,790
don't worry about it because I'm gonna

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,620
you know go get the representative from

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,200
a tronic who you're so lucky is in the

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,670
office today and that guy said software

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,530
run and this this set me down a path

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,470
where I started researching the safety

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,510
of software in these devices and it you

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,280
know I was able to luckily make it a

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,950
part of my job and and did a bunch of

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,889
research and ultimately I decided that I

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,530
had to get this afib relator and get

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,800
proprietary software literally implanted

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,450
in my

00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,920
body and skirt into my heart and and and

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,810
that I would advocate for software

00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,740
safety and when you start looking at

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:28,350
your own mortality and your own life and

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,020
you realize that you rely on software

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,700
that you can't see that you you know you

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,200
can't review you can't get anybody else

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,040
to review it if there's a problem you

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,750
can't patch it and we're still society

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,810
this is the problem we're locked into

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,890
single vendors if you know if we have a

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,090
problem with our you know if there's a

00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,980
catastrophic failure at one of these

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,610
medical device companies then we're out

00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:57,050
of luck I can't update my defibrillator

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,370
and it is a problem I have to wait until

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,590
Medtronic well I'm picking on Medtronic

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,760
but I chose them because I thought they

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,470
were the best of the bunch

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,720
but I have to wait for Medtronic to

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,850
admit that there's a problem for them to

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,430
you know make a fix to deploy that fix

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,010
I'm completely powerless and once you

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,930
start thinking about your medical

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,080
devices in your heart it's not a long

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,669
walk to get to cars which luxury car is

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,290
like a hundred million lines of code and

00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:25,440
the software engineering attitude in

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,850
estimates that there's one bug

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,380
introduced for every one hundred lines

00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,020
of code so even if we're catching the

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:35,160
vast majority medical device recalls

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,840
have been have demonstrated that things

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,790
simple things like all-pairs testing

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,380
would have avoided ninety eight percent

00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,000
of the software recalls in medical

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,800
devices it's all really fascinating and

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,620
it's a whole talk event of itself but

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,000
for me this got me extremely passionate

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,770
about software freedom where I

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,490
previously thought that open-source was

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:55,590
cool I have now come along to the view

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,320
that software freedom is absolutely

00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,870
essential to our lives to our society

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,570
and to our overall framework and that

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,600
has put me solidly in the free software

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:09,000
space and I'm lucky that I get to work

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,110
on the charity side so the software

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,590
freedom Conservancy is a 501c3 that's a

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,120
reference to the US tax code extremely

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,860
geeky and you get a lot of people in our

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,260
space who know all about the different

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,419
tax codes and will rattle off numbers to

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,860
you it's like the same people who write

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,710
a lot of sections of the GPL at you

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,120
hotel

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:33,009
which section c3 refers to the US tax

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,009
code I'm said charity and there are

00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:38,410
analogs in you know in in in every

00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:39,910
country has most of them have like

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,900
different kinds of charitable

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:45,910
organizations versus you know a trade

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,860
association which in the u.s. is a c6

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,800
you'll hear people say it's just III

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,960
it's a c6 C 3 charity C 6 trade

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,330
associations we've got companies free

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,550
software is developed in a wide variety

00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,870
of ways in a wide variety of

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,650
organizations and all these

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:05,020
organizations are working together on a

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,229
lot of the same goals but with extremely

00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,720
different motivations if you look at all

00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,759
these different areas you can sort of

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,599
start to contemplate how that might

00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,639
start to play out and in this talk I'm

00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,910
sort of focusing on the company element

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,520
because I think that's you know we're

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,780
sort of at a point of maturity in free

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,270
and open-source software where we're

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,669
able to to see what's happened over a

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:35,560
longer period of time and and start to

00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:39,190
look forward and how that impacts us we

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,830
will move forward yeah so I think it's

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,510
so awesome that companies have an

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,610
interest in free software raise your

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,370
hand if you're making money by working

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,610
in free and open source software it's

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:54,630
like three quarters of the room I did

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,740
notice that John Sullivan of the FSF was

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,419
and and I should raise my hand too

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,539
because I do a take a salary from

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:03,039
Conservancy and but but the company

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:04,840
interest in in free and open source

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,820
software is fantastic because it means

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,020
we all get to work on the like making

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,659
sure that there's great free and open

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,960
source software that companies use in

00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:19,020
their products it works out well for a

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:21,759
lot of reasons oh and and I think that

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,110
in fact it's essential that companies be

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,940
interested in free and open source

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,320
software because it takes free and open

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,960
source software to another level and it

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,729
means that freedom like it means that

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,370
free software is doing something right

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,510
if the software is so good that

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,520
companies are deploying it in their

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,500
products and it's now an essential part

00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,789
of the software that companies need to

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,370
be relevant and to

00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:45,010
and to bring their products to market

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,449
and it's great that there's money in

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,329
free and open-source software because

00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:51,490
everyone needs to eat and on top of that

00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:53,740
we can do a lot more when there are

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:56,019
people working full-time on on these

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,250
issues and when companies are employing

00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,190
those people to work in free software

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:03,850
there's there there are interesting

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:07,720
things that happen so this works out

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:10,089
some of the time it works out where

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,370
companies employ people to work in free

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,399
software and great work is done and

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,070
everybody benefits from it there's

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,920
companies have you know increased

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,649
software to draw from companies work

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,079
together where they're allies in some

00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,490
ways and competitors and others and it's

00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:31,839
very interesting this is a slide from

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:33,820
the Linux Foundation brochure and might

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,610
be I they may have updated it since then

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,529
but but it sort of says all the places

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,050
where Linux is and you can kind of

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:44,709
appreciate like how how much money there

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:46,589
is in free software and how and how

00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:51,819
relevant

00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:55,230
Linux is generally the Linux kernel but

00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:58,389
when you start to evaluate or GNU Linux

00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:02,260
okay when when I when you start to

00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:04,899
evaluate the you know these the presence

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:11,019
of companies and free software you start

00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:13,360
to feel the boundaries of where we say

00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,860
like lawyers say our interests are

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,350
aligned like when we're talking about

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,630
people who have different motivations or

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,569
interested in different things but who

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:25,510
but who are working together and so

00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:27,190
their interests are aligned and so you

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,680
can see how the free software community

00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,019
and society's interests are often

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,130
aligned with companies but when you

00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:35,230
start to think about it closely you

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,660
start to get to the borders and

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,639
boundaries of where those interests are

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,829
in fact the line and during the

00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,019
introductory panel yesterday about open

00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:48,810
hardware we started to touch on it and

00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:52,360
and and Andy was talking about a

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,069
particular product where

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,170
the product was effectively bricked

00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:59,619
because the company who had sold it had

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,499
turned off the services to it and Fidel

00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:05,529
was talking about how you know in an

00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:08,110
Internet of Things we we really need

00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,699
open standards and companies need to you

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,019
know we need to make choices where we

00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:13,720
can work together so that the efforts

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:18,189
that we make individually extend to

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,869
everyone and you know I think that was

00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:22,179
sort of starts to really hit it on the

00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:23,920
head and I think that was we think

00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:26,619
critically about the role of free

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,350
software in society or the role of free

00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:32,579
software companies we hit against this

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,579
idea very very quickly

00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:39,309
every Snowden gave a really amazing

00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:42,699
keynote Q&A at Libra planet and there he

00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:44,949
said well sometimes corporations are on

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:47,170
our side and sometimes stand up for the

00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:49,779
public interest we should not have to

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,730
rely on them and that's that's the thing

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,369
is that companies can do the right thing

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,259
you know they can have societal

00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:58,209
interests at heart but it's not their

00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:59,319
goal it's not their job it's not what

00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,509
they're set up for they're set up to

00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,649
maximize profit and there are ethical

00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,730
rules and different countries have

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,369
different rules about things that

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:10,209
companies can do and I don't want to

00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:13,089
overly dramatize it because I I'm not

00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:14,589
you know I I wouldn't you know I don't

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,230
think that anyone can say that companies

00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:18,970
are you know are evil they're they're

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,709
could in extreme cases be some evil

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,389
people working at a particular company

00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:24,879
but these things are much more complex

00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:27,279
it's just that companies have the goal

00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,989
of making profit and they're not

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,059
necessarily looking out for the public

00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:35,049
interest and in fact they often have

00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:38,559
incentives such that they're not focused

00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:39,459
on the public interest at all how we

00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,230
raise your hand if you've heard of

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,429
Volkswagen and the next scandal that

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,439
happened recently I think that's

00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,389
probably everybody ok raise your hand if

00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:48,910
you've heard about VMware and the

00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,919
lawsuit against them so that's like okay

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,480
like for crews okay so I chose these two

00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,290
companies not because they both begin

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,290
with the letter V

00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,209
but but so so the Volkswagen scandal

00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:01,079
which I don't think I need to go in

00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:05,879
because I think everybody raised their

00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:09,440
hand it was very interesting because you

00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:12,870
know it's it's a it was a part of a

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,899
technology where if you know if the

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,819
engineers in-house like though we're

00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:21,980
working within VMware had felt empowered

00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:25,529
to raise the issue much punch earlier

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,899
you would see that actually Volkswagen

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,009
would have done better profit wise -

00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:32,819
it's a very interesting situation

00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:36,029
because you know there was this you know

00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:37,500
having this this this scandal and some

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:40,560
what some of the people knew that this

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,050
was happening and the corporate culture

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,610
was such that it was more and they

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,350
determined it was more on Volkswagens

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,290
interests to keep this quiet hoping they

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,120
wouldn't be caught and corporate

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,879
interests sometimes point in that

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,350
direction whereas if there's there

00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,860
alright well I'll get to that point but

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,810
but VMware VMware is is very interesting

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,550
because so for people who didn't know

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,009
and there were about a quarter view who

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,139
didn't one of the things that we do at

00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:10,380
the software freedom Conservancy is that

00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:14,189
we have a group of kernel developers who

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:17,130
hold copyrights in their portions of the

00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:19,110
Linux kernel and they come together as a

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,269
group within Conservancy to have us

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,480
enforce their copyrights and so we go

00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:27,389
knocking on company's doors and we say

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:30,029
hey you're you've not you've got no

00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:31,680
source with your product and no offer

00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:33,449
first source can you do something about

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,319
it and we have a lot of back-and-forth

00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:39,029
about that we also now have the Debian

00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:41,339
copyright aggregation project which

00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:45,300
which does a similar thing for Debian

00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:47,250
and and VMware was a company that we had

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,769
tried to get into compliance for four

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:53,040
years and while they had made

00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:54,420
significant progress towards doing their

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,459
anything and having compliance at the

00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,209
end of the day they put their foot down

00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:01,470
and said that they they basically didn't

00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:04,410
agree with the derivative works

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:07,079
provisions of the GPL is how it related

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:09,600
to VMware and they refused to comply and

00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:12,960
so Christophe Helwig filed

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,800
the Conservancy funded in Germany and

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,370
that's starting to unfold and it's it'll

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,040
be interesting to see where where that

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:26,060
case lies but all of these things point

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,740
towards the motivations of companies

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,960
with their use of software and how that

00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,450
might be different from what you know

00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,150
what the community might want and one of

00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:38,790
those ways that that plays out in a very

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,790
fundamental way is the time scale at

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:43,860
which companies are acting are often

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,540
more concerned with their quarterly

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,790
results and they are about their

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:51,330
long-term results and so they're going

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:53,820
to be highly motivated to to look a

00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,470
little bit more short-term as opposed to

00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,200
there are some companies that think very

00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,210
strategically about the long term but

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,490
overall corporate culture has become

00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,470
what global corporate culture has become

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,880
one such that companies are really

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:10,710
trying to maximize their quarterly

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,480
results and what makes a good short-term

00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:16,140
medium-term decision for our company is

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,030
often not at all what's good for you

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,830
know what's good for society or even

00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,520
what's good in the long-term interests

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,960
of customers because companies don't

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,300
necessarily care if you'll be a customer

00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,160
of theirs in 10 years they care more

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,460
that your continued tomorrow and next

00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,600
week and next month especially in

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,150
technology where it's very hard to

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,670
predict where technology might go within

00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:42,420
the next year or two there are a lot of

00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:44,130
ways in which companies don't

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,160
necessarily have your interests at heart

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,990
that are not necessarily nefarious so

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:54,980
for example you know I have this

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:58,080
pacemaker defibrillator I am NOT in the

00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,630
standard set of people who get pacemaker

00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:05,610
defibrillators still I'm young enough

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:08,160
that that's still true and I was

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:10,110
recently pregnant and when I've been

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,470
pregnant I've been shocked twice

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:15,030
inappropriately by my defibrillator

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,800
because my heart was doing something

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,180
that a normal pregnant woman's heart

00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,380
does pregnant women often have their

00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,640
hearts race and my pulse shot up and and

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,189
I got

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,780
twice even though I was not in need of a

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:33,450
shock and and simply put I couldn't

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,850
expect Medtronic to be focused on my use

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:39,870
case because for example when I went to

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:42,690
my my obstetrician in New York City at a

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,870
major hospital where the high-risk

00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,760
doctor surely saw thousands I mean she

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,610
was a senior in her career she's a great

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,720
doctor and you know I said you know

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,860
there were a couple things that I said

00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,350
to her like you know if you have

00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,320
patients with defibrillators you should

00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,540
know that if they get an epidural you've

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,530
it reminds you of getting shocked you

00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,910
know you should know this for your

00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,010
future defibrillator patients and she

00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,809
looked at me and she said Karen I don't

00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:10,260
have defibrillator patients that have

00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:12,510
babies like I don't have I did you know

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,549
I had one other patient in all of my

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,350
years like five years ago who had a

00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:19,559
defibrillator who had a baby in my

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,120
hospital and you know it's just simply

00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,460
the class of people who have

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,320
defibrillators and the class of people

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,480
who have babies overlap very little and

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,250
so men tronic as a company doesn't have

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,890
a strong sample set to work with they're

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,380
not focused on the use case I promise

00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:38,370
you that Medtronic does not want their

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,200
pregnant patients being shocked they

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,790
have a strong interest in making sure

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
that pregnant women with heart

00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,570
conditions are not inappropriately

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,750
shocked but nonetheless I was shocked

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:51,690
because they the the company simply

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:54,120
wasn't focused on my use case and this

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,590
can happen in many ways and it's hard to

00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,570
predict the ways in which you're using

00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,190
software that was written for one

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,100
purpose how you might be using it for a

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:04,320
use case that wasn't anticipated and and

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,270
this is true across the board and the

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,740
you know my my health condition is to

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,210
sort of a metaphor for all the ways we

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,549
use software when you move from one

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,780
geographic region to another communities

00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,220
have different needs and they have

00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,260
different cultures and they use software

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,880
very differently and then you could have

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,380
a whole nother we could talk a lot and I

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:24,000
hope that we do in informally about how

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,460
improving diversity in our communities

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,980
helps us deal with a little bit more by

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,100
anticipating use cases across cultures

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,530
and across expectations so that's sort

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,740
of that's sort of one way that there's

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:39,510
sort of a mismatch

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:43,600
um you know how many people here think

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,920
that free and open like free software

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,630
and open-source software are the same

00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,010
thing raise your hand if you think it's

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,510
not your question like really whatever

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,830
you think like if you think it's the

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,030
same thing razor hood how many people

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,820
think they're radically different things

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,140
or different things okay so okay so it's

00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,450
interesting so more people thought there

00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,830
were very different things than thought

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,250
they were the same but there were a lot

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:06,370
of people who were undecided and I can

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:10,950
tell you that maybe like five years ago

00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:14,860
maybe more I was on a real advocating

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:16,300
bent to convince people that it really

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,980
didn't matter what we called free

00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,240
software and open-source software didn't

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,770
matter what we called it as long as we

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,740
were talking about freedom and if you

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,540
look the definition the the four

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,960
freedoms and the open source definition

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:32,140
line up pretty well there are a few very

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,179
historic situations where there are

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,850
licenses that are approved by outside

00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:39,970
but not a not considered free by the non

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:42,610
the free software foundations list but

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,290
generally the what we're talking about a

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,630
principle are the same thing and so I

00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,820
think that from a legal perspective we

00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,590
could use the terms interchangeably but

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,140
with the perspective now that I've had

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,360
of watching you know watching companies

00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,540
in our space a little bit more I'm

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,950
actually feel a little bad about the

00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,320
glossing over that I had done because

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,940
the motivations that are represented by

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,550
the terms free so even if it's not a

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,559
legal description of licenses the

00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,720
motivations that people assign when they

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,220
talk about free software versus when

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,470
they talk about open-source software are

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,020
very interesting and very different has

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,760
anybody here seen the Silicon Valley

00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,730
some people have apparently

00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,470
okay so like everyone who's seen the TV

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,600
show Silicon Valley was laughing very

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,130
loudly oh so not very many people in

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,809
here there's this TV show in the United

00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,670
States called Silicon Valley it's

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:32,550
hilarious it's about the like startup

00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,309
culture in Silicon Valley in California

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:38,350
and there's this company called hooli

00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:39,820
which is like a an analogue to Google

00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,320
and it's just a big but it's like

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,140
amalgamation of the different companies

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,820
and in the first season of this show

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,679
everywhere they go in Silicon Valley

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,400
people are talking about making the

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,950
world better

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,960
through whatever startup idea they had

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,700
and there were posters everywhere making

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,290
the world better through blahdy blahdy

00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,850
blahdy blahdy blah what actually they

00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,260
weren't making the world trying to make

00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,510
the world better they were just using

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:05,890
that language and when I first saw that

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:08,230
on TV my jaw dropped I was like wait

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,150
that is our rhetoric and we've been

00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,070
using that in software freedom to talk

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,590
about making the world better and it's

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,990
been completely co-opted by companies

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,150
who are also active in our space who may

00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:22,360
also be to some extent making the world

00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:25,240
better but co-opting that message so

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,280
strongly that it's now a joke I think

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,830
it's now completely it's such a joke

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,530
that everywhere in this show there's

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:34,450
like it for the entire season it was

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,490
somebody you know it's but the you know

00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,780
we are raising our series a but the

00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:43,870
important thing is we're making the

00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:45,610
world better and you know it's it's it's

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,200
interesting to sort of like take a hard

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,280
look at you know and it didn't actually

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,620
threw me through a loop because I

00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,850
thought wait am i trying to make the

00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,470
world better through software freedom

00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,500
really or have I completely lost the

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,059
plot because this is my you know this is

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:02,290
this is what I've been saying and is

00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:03,460
that true and and I think I sort of come

00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,800
out at the other end of saying well

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,440
actually this is this is residual from

00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,820
from a very good job that the free

00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,590
software community has been doing if

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,630
making companies feel welcome and making

00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,370
them feel empowered and good about the

00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,380
choices they make by investing in free

00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,400
software and that there's a lot of there

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,170
are a lot of good things that are

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,870
related to this that we can continue to

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:25,450
increase but we have to be very wary of

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:28,030
who are what our motivations are and

00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,980
who's selling us what so that we know

00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,480
how we can interact with them and what

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,460
we should do for is partnerships and I

00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,830
can tell you that undertaking GPL

00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,240
enforcement completely eye-opening to

00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,280
see what companies do and how they

00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,020
really think about free software because

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,580
when you ask them to comply in their out

00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,350
of compliance when you ask them to

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,710
really release their you know

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,059
proprietary kernel models the answers

00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,270
you get are not about making the world

00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:51,270
better

00:23:52,830 --> 00:24:00,040
and so you know we need we need

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,280
companies we need to work with them free

00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,440
software

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,120
won't be relevant we won't win we won't

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,280
I mean win whatever that means we won't

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,990
we won't be relevant we won't really

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,490
make the world better if we don't also

00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,470
have companies participating and

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,140
contributing and companies have a lot to

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,510
add with their own perspective but we

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,670
need to do it on our own terms and we

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,910
need to sort of as a community take more

00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:24,860
ownership of that and and and and be

00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:30,380
more of a participant in that culture

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:32,540
um so I'm naturally an optimist nice by

00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,280
nature I'm a very like I really think

00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,930
the best of people and I think the best

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,770
of companies I think the best of the

00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:41,510
world I you know I've I've been accused

00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,720
of being a bit of a Pollyanna at times

00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:46,850
however as a lawyer I

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,140
there's nothing about being a being

00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,870
trained to be a lawyer except being

00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,030
trained to be a pessimist and expect to

00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,610
expect absolutely the worst of everyone

00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,500
and you have to expect that situations

00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:00,350
will go bad and you have to expect that

00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:03,440
even though you're working positively

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:06,350
with a company today that tomorrow like

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,280
relationship micro south and it might be

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:12,380
because the people who are in ownership

00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,960
or running the company have had

00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,550
incentives to change their goals but it

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,620
could also just simply be that the

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,090
company has been acquired or that

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,210
leadership has changed completely you

00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,220
can't expect that a company that is a

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,040
good actor today will be a good actor

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,540
tomorrow um and that's again not to say

00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,300
you should be unreasonably suspicious

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,190
but you need to plan for the worst case

00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,660
scenarios no matter what and this is why

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,150
we have lawyers and this is why we have

00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,250
legal regimes and what it's really about

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:44,000
is it's about power and it's about a

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:46,940
Power Balance and what's what's one of

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,470
the things that's really cool about free

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,420
and open source software is that we have

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:54,140
some legal regimes that are sometimes in

00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:59,330
place to help keep that balance of power

00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:01,610
and the GPL is a fundamental mechanism

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,310
for keeping that balance of power with

00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:06,620
companies keeping that balance of power

00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:08,150
with each other and also keeping that

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,270
balance of power and check with

00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,289
developers and with society in general

00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:16,990
so this is a

00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:20,059
like just a copy heart logo with the GPL

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:23,750
but as you may have noticed some people

00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:26,510
have sort of like in the last five to

00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:29,600
ten years lacks permissive licensing has

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,130
really taken hold and it's been a real I

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,309
don't know if you see some real vigorous

00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:37,130
nodding and he in the audience and and I

00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:43,340
think a lot of that has to do with not

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:45,590
the original emphasis on Lex permissive

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,110
licensing not the original freedom

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:51,559
emphasis from the BSD community is that

00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:55,279
cultural insistence on on a pure kind of

00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:58,519
freedom that you know where where folks

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,110
thought that the that the GPL was too

00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:03,080
restrictive right and then the only way

00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,880
of having true freedom was to have the

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,309
ability to proprietor eyes it and that

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,139
you know as a concept of freedom I think

00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:12,380
that is actually shifted and it's not

00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:13,940
the reason why why in the last ten years

00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,380
that lacks permissive licensing has

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,080
become so popular it's become so popular

00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:21,200
because companies have been messaging so

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,350
strongly that the only way you can get

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,419
your software adopted is by using a lots

00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:29,240
permissive license and people have

00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:32,000
bought this so wholeheartedly it's so

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:35,059
fascinating to me because we had so much

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,500
success with Linux under the GPL and

00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:38,840
there are certain accomplishment like

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,360
the the technology gets to a place with

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,159
the GPL that you wouldn't necessarily be

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,070
able to get to otherwise and that there

00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:48,559
you know and Lena's Torvalds for example

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:51,590
has publicly said that the biggest

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,750
contribution he made was not any

00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:56,059
technological contribution but instead

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:59,409
the license choice behind the Linux

00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:01,909
kernel and so we have we have a real

00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:03,590
we're really out of balance on this

00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:07,760
because we've gone very strongly as a

00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:12,559
society towards non copy lefted software

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,149
and this has upset sort of the balance

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,289
of what we can expect from companies and

00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:19,010
I thought it was very interesting this

00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:22,159
is Martin Fink of Hewlett Packard

00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,570
enterprises at the last Linux con Europe

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,290
he gave a talk and he said we need to

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:30,440
change the default back to copy

00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,670
from permissive licensing and and he

00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,550
gave a lot of really interesting

00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:36,410
business minded reasons why it's good

00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,000
for business that this is the case he

00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:40,490
said that you know what happens is if

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,980
you choose a non copyleft license you

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,450
have to introduce all of this governance

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,010
and infrastructure to make sure that

00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,050
companies play fairly with one another

00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:51,710
and it's expensive and it's artificial

00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:55,060
and it sometimes breaks down but but

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:57,440
from our perspective I think that from a

00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,180
community project from a community

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,180
perspective I think his message of

00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,580
change the default has a whole you know

00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:07,010
additional power to it and I thought

00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,080
like you know hearing somebody who is

00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:13,310
coming from such a curved perspective

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:15,830
echo echo within a corporate construct

00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:17,630
what I think that we need to do more as

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,280
a society you know is this my society in

00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,440
a community that was I think extremely

00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,600
powerful and so if somebody tries to

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,230
tell you that if you're starting a new

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,380
project that you will only find success

00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:32,480
and popularity by using a permissive

00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,760
license it's simply not true and it's

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,950
again change trading those long term

00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,690
versus short term goals maybe you'll get

00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,240
some companies to adopt it a little bit

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,190
sooner but down the road your project is

00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,900
is potentially going to be forked by

00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,370
another company and you won't be able to

00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,020
see any of those changes and you'll be

00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:51,500
completely locked out of the relevant

00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:56,000
part of your software so this is

00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:58,220
something to think about and enforcement

00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,840
basically without enforcement there is

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,220
no copy left effectively you could

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,440
choose a license until you're blue in

00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,880
the face but if there's not anyone who's

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,560
going to enforce it at the end of the

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,120
day you may as well have never made that

00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,290
choice to begin with nobody is going to

00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,050
take you seriously if there are no

00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:16,910
consequences to you know not following

00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:19,430
the rules but having centralized power

00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:22,460
can really really frustrate that balance

00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:24,500
so if you have one company that so if

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,070
it's for example a strong copyleft

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:30,860
license if it's in a GPL or in a GPL

00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:33,410
program but it's all the copyrights are

00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,990
owned by a single company then you have

00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:38,180
a Power Balance and the fact that the

00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,990
software is under a copyleft license

00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,750
helps but it

00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,400
get you all the way to that to that that

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,170
great bouncing in many ways Debian

00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,940
really has the best of both worlds

00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,950
because with Debian it's such a big

00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,410
project and their copyrights that are so

00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:54,440
diversely held no one could aggregate

00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:56,990
those copyrights even if they try but we

00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,970
don't necessarily want to because having

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,760
a project that's held diversely

00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:04,309
is extremely powerful and helpful it

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,950
keeps it keeps these power balances much

00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:10,130
more in check but at the same time

00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,720
Debian's

00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:14,270
dubbing has set up the copyright

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,610
aggregation program with Conservancy and

00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:18,800
so we will a great copyrights for people

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:21,679
who are interested in doing so and that

00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,570
way we can help if there is a violation

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,790
it's easier to pursue it because if you

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,410
have a diversely held project and

00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,970
there's a violation who's going to be

00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,380
the one to knock on the company's door

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:34,040
they're not going to take any one

00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:36,080
developer seriously enough because it's

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,760
such a small amount of code so if we

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,500
aggregate it together it means that not

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,820
only do we empower a single steward

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,020
that's going to be helpful but it also

00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:47,480
enables someone with a single voice to

00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:49,340
be able to sort of speak for enforcement

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:54,140
to make sure that the right thing is

00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:56,179
done for the project we also to respect

00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,550
the the diversity of copyrights we also

00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,900
now take enforcement agreements so that

00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,309
if people don't want to have their

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,870
copyrights enforced we can do

00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:05,240
enforcement agreements in addition to

00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:07,429
just plain old copyright stewardship and

00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,080
so it's sort of many ways it's the best

00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:10,550
of both worlds I mean I think that a lot

00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,870
of the things that Debian has done has

00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:19,610
made it such a unique community I think

00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:21,530
that the way that that there are so many

00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,970
developers that are so independent and

00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:26,270
the way you come together and elect a

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:27,500
single DPL is a amazing and unusual

00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,080
thing and I think is the reason why the

00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,540
Debian community has whether the time so

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,480
well even though many companies are

00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:37,220
building on Debian for their products

00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,570
the Debian community stays so strong

00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,809
it's so independent and it's so

00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:44,330
interesting and it's so unique another

00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:45,800
thing that I think we all need to pay

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,080
attention to that can help tip that

00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,190
balance is with our employment agreement

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,809
it's how many people here have an

00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,370
employment agreement in place for what

00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:54,990
they're working on now

00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,460
wow that's so low it's like only like a

00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,500
quarter of the people in here

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,210
I bet many of you actually have

00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:11,580
employment agreements that you don't

00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:12,810
realize that you have so so I so I'll be

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,640
move a little bit faster in this but

00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,380
just say that when you take a new job at

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,940
a company you will be generally asked to

00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,200
sign an employment agreement and those

00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,790
employment agreements have been getting

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,020
stronger and stronger and stronger over

00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:26,760
time and I often ask for the world they

00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:29,240
basically tell you that everything that

00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,650
or agree that everything that you do

00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,870
either not just within the context of

00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,400
your job but at all during the time that

00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:39,270
you're employed is owned by your company

00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,880
and yeah so they're different

00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,260
jurisdictions have some have so some

00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,940
checks and balances but the lines on

00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,310
that aren't necessarily as clear as you

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,110
think that they are so it's really it's

00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,910
all very very fascinating stuff but in

00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,320
any case making sure that you have an

00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,090
agreement with your employer about

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,010
working on free software is important

00:33:54,090 --> 00:34:00,780
and making sure that you negotiate that

00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:02,070
and ask for more as is is essential so

00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,010
we a Conservancy are working on a

00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:06,840
project where we're publishing standard

00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:09,419
contract language so you can say I would

00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,640
like you know provisions one three and

00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:13,200
five when you negotiate with an employer

00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,020
and they can say oh we never take five

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,760
but maybe we take one interview

00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,679
occasionally and we're working with some

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,080
companies so that they can review it and

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,360
they they'll say we may never take this

00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,310
these provisions like we may never let

00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,380
individuals hold our copyrights but if

00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:30,780
we do the the language looks like this

00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,669
but asking companies if you can hold

00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,620
your own copyrights some people do

00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:36,720
negotiate it and that some of those I

00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:41,220
admit our rocks are developers but some

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:43,830
are not and if we all ask for it if

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:47,100
everybody who is like all a lot of the

00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:48,810
talented developers that that a company

00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,690
seeks to hire ask to keep their

00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,710
copyrights or asks for the freedom to

00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,710
work a free and open-source software

00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:58,440
that's you know outside of their job if

00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,450
we all ask for it then some companies

00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,250
will start to bend because they'll see

00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:04,290
it as a feature for recruiting talent

00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,800
and together we can make a huge

00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,270
difference

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,220
in the culture of the space and the

00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,500
bargaining power some people are

00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,300
advocating for like unionized free

00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:17,210
software development which is very

00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:20,700
interesting notion but but I think that

00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:23,100
it's sort of from a plain old normal way

00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,560
I think it would be very interesting if

00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,940
we all started to ask about about

00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,550
keeping our own copyrights and other

00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:33,360
provisions so we're working to enable

00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:35,880
people to do that support the charitable

00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,470
nonprofits you just think about it's

00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:43,560
very self-serving so I know people are

00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:46,050
laughing or Keith is laughing but but

00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,910
but having but you know it's it's not

00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,240
just the conservancies it's the SPI is

00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:54,690
right it's all the it's it's now be

00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,670
tails nodding oh you know it's

00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,050
supporting the charitable structures

00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:00,360
around free and open-source software

00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:02,040
because there are they are what are

00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,930
going to enable us to keep the interests

00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,630
of the community and the interests of

00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:08,640
society at heart and you know the free

00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:11,550
software foundation SPI Conservancy

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,700
where organizations that have a mission

00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:17,100
to support free and open source software

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:19,530
for freedom and so keeping the

00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:22,280
charitable organization strong is really

00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:25,770
essential and Conservancy in the last

00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,720
last year shifted its if in last year

00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:29,970
shifted its business model so we're now

00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,800
individually funded primarily rather

00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,960
than company funded and we found that

00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,430
it's enabled us to be focused more on

00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,170
the programs that are important to

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,690
community and important to society and

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,310
if we were funded by companies if we

00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,290
were a trade association we could never

00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:45,300
do that in the same way and it's not

00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,130
that trade associations don't do good

00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,660
work and it's not that they they can't

00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:52,050
also be doing things in the public good

00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:54,840
it's just it's not their focus um and so

00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,880
I would say really like you're also

00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,320
awesome for being at dub Kampf and for

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,170
being involved in the Debian community

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,660
and Debian is so unique and so focused

00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:06,720
on freedom so stay focused on freedom

00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:09,240
it's the most amazing thing and together

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,990
we can make the world better and not in

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:16,950
an ironic hilarious way oh so I'm happy

00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:18,150
to announce that that due to a generous

00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:21,690
donation by an anonymous

00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:23,250
donar anybody at Deb Kampf who signs up

00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,710
as a Conservancy supporter will be

00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,970
matched so it's a really good time if

00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,900
you're I don't want to give a sales

00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:33,720
pitch but but but it's a good time

00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:35,069
because because someone who's here who

00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,099
cares passionate about software freedom

00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:40,319
is going to give this to match that

00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:43,670
donation anyway so does anybody have any

00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:43,670
questions do we have time for questions

00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:55,069
thank you very much we started a bit

00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,069
late so we have time for a few questions

00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:24,599
you mentioned out of work and then if

00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:28,819
it's regarding the work that you are

00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:33,930
doing but in a community such as ours

00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:37,490
the do you have or do you work with

00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:40,619
similar groups not focusing in the u.s.

00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:42,779
because I mean yeah the rules are

00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:44,520
different everywhere and I'm sure it

00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:48,569
would be very hard for you personally to

00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,250
litigate here or whatever yes I am a

00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:52,789
u.s. flirt admitted to practice in the

00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:55,289
state of New York and not anywhere else

00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:58,890
this is not legal advice and I am NOT

00:38:55,289 --> 00:39:02,160
your lawyer however however free

00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:05,460
software is global you can't simply have

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,710
a US focus and and work in free software

00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,029
so we're we're focused on a lot of

00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,279
different jurisdictions obviously we're

00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:15,750
focused in places that a lot of us are

00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:18,059
so you know we have you know like our

00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:20,339
our programs where we have enforcement

00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:21,930
agreements and assignment agreements

00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:25,230
like for the linux kernel and for debian

00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:27,900
we we obviously work with lawyers in

00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:31,589
those places too so we have you know a

00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,830
European agreement for assignment now we

00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:33,930
are

00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,940
u.s. entity so it means that to the

00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,010
extent that we're taking copyrights from

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,410
developers we're gonna hold them in the

00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:43,500
u.s. because we are in the US but we

00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:47,400
have function abroad we function

00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,870
everywhere and and you know we we for

00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,270
example don't have any South African

00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:52,890
lawyers we've been working with but but

00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:55,440
whenever there's a place where someone

00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:57,510
is very interested in and there's enough

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,510
of an interest that it would be worth

00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:02,310
the expenditure we we look to experts

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:05,750
from those places and I think that you

00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:09,480
simply can't just think about the US

00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:11,460
however I think these it's interesting

00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,650
is that a lot of for better or for worse

00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,260
a lot of the countries have followed the

00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:19,530
u.s. in a lot of policy and often that's

00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:22,230
for worse in many places the patents

00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:25,680
regimes have followed the US and I think

00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:28,980
a lot of the charitable structures as

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,570
well and so you know most of the from

00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,240
one and for example the Food and Drug

00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:34,710
Administration's review in the u.s. over

00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,420
my medical base I used to when I gave a

00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:39,120
talk the medical devices talk I would do

00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,560
a lot of research into the local places

00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,930
Food and Drug Administration and

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,790
reviewed processes but every place I

00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,410
went to it was the same they didn't

00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:49,170
review this sort of software they didn't

00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,670
so there's most of the the big

00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,920
ideological issues are the same from

00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,580
place to place and for the details we

00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,580
work with partners

00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:52,010
early early is really important making

00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,320
these decisions early is so essential

00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,750
you can you can never turn back the

00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,790
clock and you'll never have as much

00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,680
power as the day that a company is

00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,690
trying to recruit you once they've

00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,160
decided to hire you before they have

00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,900
actually entered to agreement with you

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,880
before you've come on staff they never

00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,050
want to hire you as much as what is in

00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,880
that moment because they've gone through

00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,280
the whole search they've decided you're

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,690
the one for them the product process is

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,760
over they just want to get the paperwork

00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:18,200
done and that's the time and if you

00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,940
think even though you may think they'll

00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,920
blow up the deal if it won't you can you

00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,980
can always blame me you can say like a

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,140
lawyer you know a lawyer told me I need

00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,720
to do these things and then they'll say

00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,950
well we never do that or and you can

00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,300
gauge the interest and if you're nice

00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:36,410
about it and not you know and not

00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,690
adversarial about it then you then it's

00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:55,370
fine

00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:57,020
I'm David I'm recording an Outkast

00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,990
freeze and freedom about the whole issue

00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:02,180
it would take a long time to discuss it

00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:04,570
so more to come on that is any more

00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,570
questions

00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:10,260
so echoing the thing about employment

00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:13,440
agreements I mean my experience in the

00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,990
UK I'm sure it's similar elsewhere is

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,089
companies will try will just try things

00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,920
on there will be a whole load of things

00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:22,290
in most employment agreements that are

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,810
strictly not enforceable and probably

00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:26,970
illegal in many jurisdictions but

00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,589
they'll put them in anyway you know it's

00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:30,680
just a case of talking through it you

00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:33,480
know their negotiations they're not

00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,579
fixed they're not fixed terms you know

00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,260
every employment every employment

00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,569
contract is different it's entirely up

00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,030
to you to talk about it I work for a

00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:44,940
company that self identifies as an IP

00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:47,160
company so I just scribbled out the

00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:51,240
thing saying that they own everything I

00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:53,339
do and it calls no hassle it's not yeah

00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,800
people think that because they're given

00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:58,740
a contract and it looks very official

00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,770
that it's fixed and there's no chance to

00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:04,230
to edit it but that's almost never true

00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:06,329
there are some companies who would

00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,630
rather walk away from employing you than

00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:11,010
editing their their employment agreement

00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:13,170
but they're the exception rather than

00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,910
the rule and so because a lot of

00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:16,859
companies will negotiate it there's a

00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:19,800
lot of room there and if it becomes more

00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:21,930
standard if more developers ask more

00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,730
employees ask for edits to the

00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,970
employment contracts and especially if

00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:28,950
they all ask for it in the same way then

00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:31,109
you know that if it's generally true in

00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:32,790
contract negotiations that when you ask

00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:34,589
when you negotiate with someone you ask

00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,329
for a way more than you want because you

00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:38,609
want to be able to come down so often

00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:40,680
it's built into these contracts

00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:43,170
provisions that companies know they're

00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,609
willing to move from and if you ask them

00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,890
to move on something else they'll say

00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:48,390
well we can't move on that but we have

00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,460
this other provision we could give you

00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:52,890
could give you you know and so chances

00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,780
are you're not getting the best deal

00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:57,839
that's already available to you if you

00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:00,180
haven't asked okay so I think we should

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,660
move on now because um it's getting out

00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,460
of time

00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,230
Karen will be around a debconf until

00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,240
Thursday I think so talk to her if you

00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,119
have any more questions or comments and

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,859
we are recommending about 10 minutes for

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,060
the billion people and even more phones

00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:16,120
by Athena Krishna thank you

00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,120
