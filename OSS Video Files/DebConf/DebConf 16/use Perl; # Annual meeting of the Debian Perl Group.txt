everyone ready

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,820
good so yeah like it here welcome thanks

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,719
for coming

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:23,369
the annual package pearl meeting maybe

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:26,010
someone could close the door I hope that

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,529
there are also people following on the

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,800
stream at least and what's the idea yeah

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,610
so for those at home we could do our

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,020
usual introduction for those who want to

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:41,180
say their name and wave into the camera

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:50,579
so that others also know here

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:57,530
I'm trigger I'm so dead I'm Dominic I'm

00:00:50,579 --> 00:01:00,680
Lucas kamishiro I'm Rhonda I'm Christian

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:05,850
I'm David Bremner

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:09,450
I'm Clem oh no Vince I'm in three and

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,299
I'm Nicole this was the quickest

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,490
introduction with Anna we've ever had

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,869
but I have a surprise which is not in

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:22,140
the agenda so last year was the first

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:25,470
time that Lucas was here in this spot

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,590
and he was in the group like I don't

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,250
know six months so already very active

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,070
and you have been totally active across

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,650
the whole year and since some days you

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:42,200
are there can develop ah so I think

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,200
that's a reason to congratulate you and

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:53,640
I have a small gift which was donated by

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,500
my medic and I thought it might be nice

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,740
to give this to the newest DT in the

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,740
group

00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:14,970
okay so this agenda is mostly copied

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:19,240
from last year but I've listed here is

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:22,630
the topic of sprints which we had in

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,440
which we might want to have again the

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:32,410
low-hanging fruit sessions the status of

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:34,840
the team as a team may be repelled 524

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:41,110
which is an important topic for the

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:43,989
group and well some other issues where I

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:47,290
might have some ideas as well others

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:52,480
also might have some new things to bring

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:57,880
up is this something we want to go with

00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:06,700
to something important missing is the

00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:10,390
order okay good so yeah I don't know

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:15,850
sprints there was one sprint in Chile at

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:26,920
the end of May does someone want to give

00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:30,640
him a quick improvised summary it was

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:35,380
attended by six people in the end fans

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:42,840
up a few at the Sprint and missing from

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:45,760
the rumor Alex and Excel Alex has

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:50,049
drafted a report which is now gone I

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:53,579
think to the somewhere at the Sprint

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:58,030
mailing list and the team mailing list

00:03:53,579 --> 00:04:02,880
and I guess there's a little bit more to

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,880
do with publicizing that

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,769
I think alex is going to do it bits

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:18,109
spent rebut so from my side we worked on

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:21,400
poll 524 and QA rebuilds there's a kind

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:33,620
of parallel topic so that was a good

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:46,750
good progress there I guess read the

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:50,900
report so I set up an instance of

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:55,010
diplomatic well with Nico's help to

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:59,090
rebuild packages mainly for the pol 5.24

00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:01,840
transition which is working pretty well

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,190
although the web interface to it is not

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:09,410
scaling the number of bits the number of

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:10,699
packages we're using it for now so if we

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,539
want to carry on using that we need to

00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:13,539
address that

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,960
yeah but it's sorry it's rebuilding

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,780
packages continuously for five three and

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,699
four so there's a repository of yeah

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,970
release packages useful which was the

00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:31,460
main aim for the thing so yeah it should

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:35,360
be easier to test 524 then it's been in

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,400
the past yeah because the packages were

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,510
available before but only not only

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:45,229
processed when I remember to say that's

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:52,940
good so I guess well that's moving into

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:55,699
a pearl 24 by 24 okay so we can publicly

00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,810
thank the University are they Ed Gein

00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:02,690
associate technician who showed it's

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:06,770
really and our sponsors yeah okay so

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:11,060
during tap camp there was also kind of a

00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:16,050
sprint so there were four people already

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:21,080
present into a David me

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:25,949
I think we met four times for

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,680
coordination meetings and worked on well

00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:33,349
tools like da jman pearl packaged pearl

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:40,639
tools entry reduce the number of

00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:44,550
unreproducible builds to almost zero and

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:47,190
as a draft report which I should

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,900
probably send out at some point I was

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:53,370
waiting for feedback so far and then

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:55,740
forgot about it yeah I don't know to

00:06:53,370 --> 00:07:09,750
even want to add something about that

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:11,880
camp I I cleaned up one Deb cherry using

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:17,240
repository so it no longer made Gregor

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:17,240
sad that was my big accomplishment

00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:28,199
keeping Gregor Happy's is an important

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:34,710
goal okay so that was the second sprint

00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:37,740
of this year I mean kind of kept camp so

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:44,039
I put hit a question next year question

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:46,169
mark maybe we can get a quick round of

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:54,810
feelings do we want to have a dedicated

00:07:46,169 --> 00:08:00,389
sprint again no I I felt that generally

00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:03,090
that the sprint was very productive we

00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:07,789
didn't have any well that we had some

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:12,120
big topics but also quite a lot of

00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:15,990
general collaboration on sort of smaller

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,889
of ongoing tasks so I definitely support

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:23,310
having another one if my main concern if

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,779
there was one would be getting more

00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,530
different people involved in that

00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,140
process

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:31,470
and I'm not sure the best way of doing

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,470
it is

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:46,630
yeah very much agreed so as long as

00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:48,490
there people coming to the sprint I

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,649
think we should have one yearly

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,010
something like that seem and the time

00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:57,010
seems to be what good with in mayor so

00:08:54,010 --> 00:09:00,930
because this is a little new apparel

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:06,790
upstream releases coming out in May so

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:10,269
it's good for preparations and all okay

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:15,010
so we might want to note down that we

00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:17,339
are targeting May 2017 for Sprint the

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:20,410
question of getting more people or

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,540
broader positive people is a good one I

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:28,810
think

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:31,320
do we have ideas on how to involve more

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,320
people

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:52,290
so Alison suggests having an event at

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,290
yep see which is where geographically

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:03,130
yep yep yep CNA just ended but yep CEU

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:04,330
should be coming up I think if I

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:10,990
remember correctly we had this

00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:13,330
discussion before having this print in

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,190
parallel to some conference and we said

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:20,339
that with rather have it separate

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:20,339
because it's easier to focus to work

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:32,110
like debian packaging training session

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:36,130
at yap c and a little bit of recruiting

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,750
effort because you have pearl people who

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,890
don't know anything at all about debian

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:44,200
that might be a good sort of place to

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,700
pull people in more than debian people

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,200
who don't know anything about pearl i

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:53,980
think right yep seas for recruiting you

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,959
members good as far as I know Alex

00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:00,100
Matata is giving a talk at this year's

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:03,970
yep CEU about Debian and about pearl

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:08,290
upstream and distributions so you could

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:10,420
also have a sprint around I mean not in

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:14,950
parallel with the conference but before

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:19,200
or after I mean Deb kam style yeah I

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,200
mean then it's not so distracting

00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:26,389
yeah I guess we could keep the idea in

00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,569
mind and see when when Deb conf is next

00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:33,230
year and when the Apps edu is next year

00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:36,769
biopsy in aim in theory but practice

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:40,360
most of us in Europe some so yeah yeah

00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:46,009
please normally three days is that right

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,779
so three plus two is kind of manageable

00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:51,019
Thanks

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:54,550
so no junky reports on IRC that yup see

00:11:51,019 --> 00:12:03,620
this year is in Cluj Transylvania mm-hm

00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:13,279
so that's a cool place to go okay

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:15,379
anything else wants prints right okay

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,249
low-hanging fruit sessions so this was

00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:22,699
the second year where we had those

00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:27,499
monthly meetings on IRC which the idea

00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:30,439
that people meet at the same time to

00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:36,079
squash some simple button we may be

00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:39,139
tedious boring issues together at least

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:42,379
in parallel this year we were so I

00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:45,199
looked a bit etre at the report this

00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:51,410
year it was at a twenty first of each

00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:55,160
month at 18:00 UTC eight of the ten

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:58,490
planned meetings actually happened to be

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:02,319
canceled one because most of us we had

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:07,509
to sprint in Syria and the last one was

00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:07,509
just before that camp and I think

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:15,220
it was nobody okay so some statistics on

00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:19,429
average there were six in the quarter

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:24,889
people which also includes people who

00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:28,819
said hi during this time in total for 14

00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:31,279
unique persons over these eight meetings

00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:33,230
which attended between one and eight

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:40,449
times the only one with eight times is

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:43,189
Nico and each of those 14 persons

00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:46,279
participated well three and a half time

00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:49,819
on average and the topics were well

00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:52,339
mostly packaging like getting new

00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:54,050
upstream releases packaged fixing Auto

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,209
packaged test failures working on our

00:13:54,050 --> 00:14:00,259
seat backs but we also had some

00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:04,129
discussions around 5:22 transition or

00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:09,709
the aftermath and cleaning up sprint

00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:11,779
planning what I do with leap into yeah

00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:13,699
about how to handle some PACs about

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:19,490
hardening flags we had one one

00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:24,339
discussion okay so that smile looking

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,339
back I don't know if others have some

00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:33,740
comments on the on the past year was

00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:37,670
this useful was it fun was it I don't

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,499
know distracting or difficult I thought

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,799
personally I found it key you supposed

00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:45,259
to have a certain time to for online

00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,980
discussions real-time discussions but uh

00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:53,749
I didn't really do much myself actually

00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:56,959
work on this but yeah I guess it's sort

00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:59,689
of borderline whether it actually worked

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,179
I mean there were very few people's

00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:08,319
generally people present generally but

00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:11,799
yeah I guess we could go on with those

00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:11,799
for the next year

00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:24,600
yeah Mike I kind of agree with the kind

00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:27,779
of very varying amount of activity but

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,439
the cost of rhythm is quite low and I

00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:35,069
think even if it's just talking to each

00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:42,600
other and it's useful time to do that

00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:45,740
and slightly more coordinated way I'd

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,740
support continuing them

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,550
okay so the spring-summer is it's not

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,660
clear if it's a huge success but I also

00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:01,490
the costs are so low that it's worth

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,640
going on and having this coordination

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,490
meetings maybe so it's not the only

00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,920
reason I didn't participate mmm

00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,890
I was also very busy and so on but the

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,900
timing is not very good or was not very

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:19,580
good for North American time zones so I

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,920
would say I think we had this discussion

00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:25,190
before and I said you should do what

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,580
works for the group who are really doing

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:33,200
work but anyway that's an excuse for me

00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:35,060
not to participate so to come back to

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,460
last year's discussions in the year

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,430
before we alternated between two

00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:45,620
different times and each second month

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:48,320
and the result was that the European

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:51,980
friendly time attracted way more people

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,650
than the Americas friendly time which

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:59,090
didn't really work out so this year we

00:16:54,650 --> 00:17:00,770
tried it with only having one time but

00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:05,780
of course that's the the question if we

00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:07,610
continue then which time to b2b pick if

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:12,290
we stay with the 21st which is just

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:14,030
arbitrary but why not then it still do

00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,440
we want this time do we want to have a

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:23,150
different time or do we want to have

00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:25,130
some time changes alternations again I'm

00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,620
going to how much time I had today but I

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,820
should suggest we discuss that on a

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,760
mailing list or something

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:36,370
the timing I mean good ol boat in here

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,370
but I not everybody's here anyway so

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,440
yeah

00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:55,429
I guess I just volunteer sir yeah I'll

00:17:51,750 --> 00:18:00,750
try okay cool

00:17:55,429 --> 00:18:05,519
good mmm

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:08,990
team status oh cool

00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:13,799
comparing to last year who was that

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:16,950
Maxie okay so we have this script

00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:20,940
committee stats and I've ran it some

00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:23,490
hours ago in it well it checks their

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:29,269
amount of commits per person in the last

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:35,610
365 days days in all our packages repos

00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:36,809
which were 56 persons where was 58 last

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:41,789
year okay

00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:45,450
and there were 14 people who had more

00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:49,850
than 100 commits in this time frame

00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:54,450
versus 11 okay so it's a rise in the

00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:57,120
more active people and more or less the

00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:00,419
same in the overall number of commuters

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,639
I mean there were years when it was more

00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:06,769
like 70 people but at least it's

00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:06,769
constant compared to last year

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,990
yeah I guess there's not much more to

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:20,620
say about this the other the other thing

00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:23,110
is we have a to-do item on our open task

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,580
page since I don't know 2011 or

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:28,390
something

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:33,570
that's about pinging members are pinging

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:37,240
inactive members which Ann skirted once

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:39,940
and I don't know how and since then we

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:46,210
are waiting for us someone to provide

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:51,760
some tooling and since Wednesday

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:54,630
something we have a script we a send the

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,600
package Ruby extras team

00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:03,880
thanks to Christian and thanks to you

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:07,270
for making it universally usable so I

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:11,230
wrote a very small wrapper to pass our

00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:14,800
team name and repository file path so we

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:19,170
can run this script now on an early

00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:23,170
Earth which outputs a CSV file of the

00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:26,560
accounts of project members on early

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:29,680
Earth who have not touched any file in

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:35,380
the last two years I think is there it's

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:39,570
the cutoff but the outcome is something

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:43,590
like 207 - we lines had a source also

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:49,360
200 after I don't know 270 or whatever

00:20:43,590 --> 00:21:01,360
members we have seem to have not touched

00:20:49,360 --> 00:21:02,230
any file in two years that's an

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,470
excellent idea

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:09,280
we are not not so fired to do anything

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:12,760
with with it but yeah maybe we should

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:16,210
so next step which are possibly is to

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:19,690
send a mail with some mail merge thing

00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:22,670
if it has already committed a Python

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:26,690
script that has the mail merge

00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:30,070
and I I started to draft that the text

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:33,320
for the mail which we will at some point

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:35,900
finish and write put it into Yammer so

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:41,780
that the Python script can who read the

00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:43,970
c-suite it's so it's worth pointing out

00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,280
that there's many reasons people are on

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,380
this list there's a lot of - guest

00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,230
accounts where people now have DD

00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:54,620
eight-counts Lucas for example but many

00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:57,740
others so it's not necessarily that

00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,200
there's 200 amia people here I mean

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:04,010
there's just a li auth accounting

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,170
sloppiness basically so that specific

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:09,070
case should be filtered out right that's

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:11,210
and that's easy to filter out or not

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,030
people don't necessarily have the same

00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:16,190
account names but it's not such a big

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:18,350
list that you can look for obvious

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:24,340
duplicates if you've got their real

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:27,020
names I mean the question is a bit about

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,840
objectives like yeah I would also like

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,020
to remove those guest accounts which are

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,940
not used anymore and it's a question of

00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,860
the wording of the mail so I tried in my

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,840
first draft to make it very clear that

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,300
this is about this account has not been

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:46,580
used for this purpose and it's not about

00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:47,990
you were inactive or something I mean my

00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,600
first reaction when I saw the list was

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:56,000
also a bit like wow really all these

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:57,950
people and I know some of them on but

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,780
I'm not sure it leads anywhere to go

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,890
through the list manually and think oh

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,960
does this person have a different

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:11,060
account or to a no demon - I want to

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:14,360
talk to them before anything email so

00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,980
the is one that's a one year cutoff it's

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,990
a two years two years their kindness

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,990
yeah that's better it makes more sense

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:28,710
but for the people who became DD

00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:32,480
stripping of the - guests and checking

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:35,790
that cross should be fairly easy in and

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:41,130
scriptable yeah but the problem is that

00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:44,790
the blackest and plat don't necessarily

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:51,210
match yeah yeah but you still can weed

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:53,220
out at least a few of them yes but then

00:23:51,210 --> 00:24:00,870
I would still like to remove the guest

00:23:53,220 --> 00:24:02,910
account from the project yeah I think

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,860
the idea there is that you do that

00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:08,960
before sending the mail so you send less

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:11,610
mails and just remove the cast account

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,929
well some people might still be using

00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,669
that guest account because they are too

00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:17,070
lazy to update their thought there's a

00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:21,090
page configure them yeah well after two

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:25,950
years okay another thing to consider

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:31,650
yeah yeah right okay getting into like

00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:34,440
sharing since somehow it took me three

00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:39,480
days so far not to do this probably we

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:41,820
shouldn't complicate it any further okay

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,940
so I mean the general question is is is

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,799
it okay to do this does it make make

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,860
sense because a good idea and this is

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,320
okay for you if if David and me try to

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:59,150
get this finished before leaving Cape

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,150
Town okay

00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:10,220
okay so thanks again Christian and you

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:18,560
get packet email template in perfect

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:24,410
English good so maybe something more

00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:30,110
technical well 524 it's something we

00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:31,970
need to know to do well it was announced

00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:37,910
that we're transitioning for stretch so

00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:41,570
that's good so I think we're in

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:46,360
reasonably good shape for the transition

00:25:41,570 --> 00:26:04,640
at this point the wiki page that's on

00:25:46,360 --> 00:26:06,050
Bobbi has status with I'm not sure how

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,560
many how many there are less than 100

00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:13,460
bucks about 524 transition probably on

00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:16,700
the other 50 or something and I think

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:19,550
there are no well the best blocker I

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:22,010
think is data Elias which saw yesterday

00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:25,460
melt the upstream authors Zefram about

00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:28,580
and then there's net SNMP Abel that

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:33,020
should be trivial to fix and so yeah I

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:36,380
think it's as long as we can do

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:41,300
something about data Elias I think we we

00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:45,380
should be fine so right now the eight

00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:48,440
books eight failed to build bugs which

00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,940
is actually pretty good compared to last

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,930
year in terms of my writing all the

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:56,500
forwarding points as well those are all

00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,500
forwarded

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,220
mmm yeah there should be something like

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:06,030
a yeah important part so data alias

00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:08,040
alias algorithm permeate net as an MP

00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:14,010
develop again lift Lex plunder Schoolnet

00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:19,050
s n PP parse HTTP user agent text as

00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:22,110
printf so basically I think we should

00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:24,720
probably file a transition but for the

00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:27,390
release team this week and then look at

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:32,580
the blog person look at what we can do

00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:36,720
about those and I guess that would make

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:39,330
it for name in August or something like

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,510
that yeah I mean on the packaging site I

00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:44,450
live there's nothing outstanding to do

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:48,330
with I mean the upload is the the

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:51,930
packages in experimental it's working as

00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:55,470
far as we know so it's really so just as

00:27:51,930 --> 00:28:05,100
you say dealing with those those two

00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:07,890
widely used packages well okay sounds

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:11,910
like a nice transition so you're going

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:14,670
to follow the transition box and then we

00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:18,620
are maybe announce a time frame yeah

00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,620
whatever help is needed

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:37,950
okay so this is my collection of of

00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:40,080
other miscellaneous topics start

00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,610
starting at the bottom this was

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,140
something that Salvatore I mentioned

00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:48,120
today in the release team talk how do we

00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:52,019
go along with uploads during the

00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:55,820
upcoming freeze so in the past there

00:28:52,019 --> 00:29:02,250
have been different strategies from

00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:05,220
going ahead with uploads except for very

00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:10,070
important packages the last phrase we

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:12,570
really didn't upload anything I think

00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,960
except for some mistakes maybe so I

00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:18,539
guess basically we haven't done

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,299
we don't have uploaded much during the

00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:24,750
last freeze and then we had a huge pile

00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:27,840
of new upstream version and it was I

00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:34,500
guess quite hard to bring that down

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:39,840
again so I just put the question what we

00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:44,700
do maybe upload to experimental or go on

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:48,620
with uploading modules without C code or

00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,620
yes I don't know what

00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:01,800
can someone articulate the downsides of

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,300
uploading to experimental so if we

00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,940
upload a thousand packages to

00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,950
experimental well it's basically useless

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,450
because then someone has to manually

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,450
upload all of them times table later

00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:19,800
could be scripted yeah also the packages

00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:23,370
are not going to get tested against each

00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:26,340
other that way so they're it's just an

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:30,350
overlay for unstable so so they're all

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,350
sort of individually there

00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:45,519
yeah I guess I don't have a good answer

00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:49,669
to that either but I'd rather err on the

00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:52,059
side of not uploading them than making

00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:55,070
trouble for the release because we have

00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:57,230
created something in unstable that can

00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:05,899
transition to testing and it's blocking

00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:10,970
something I mean we don't we don't have

00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:12,320
to decide on a fixed policy I mean we we

00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,759
can I don't think we can rely on

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,820
uploaders to exercise their judgment

00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,590
about what's appropriate to upload to

00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,830
unstable during the freeze just as they

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:25,369
would for other packages so there might

00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:29,799
be a higher bar to uploading some types

00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:31,940
of changes but thinking in general it's

00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:35,210
you can kind of Judge that on a

00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:39,710
case-by-case basis leaked packages in

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:42,859
general are fine right yeah and lots of

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:48,100
our packages not all of them obviously

00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:48,100
but lots are leaked packages

00:31:51,750 --> 00:32:00,210
so it's you see attachment be careful

00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:12,360
and err err on the safe side yes rough

00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:15,390
guidelines good yeah the other two

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,960
points here were well at least that

00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:23,780
Christian and me had at some party

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:30,150
meetings so the the second one language

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:31,710
packaging skills exchange we found that

00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:35,429
where we were sitting besides each

00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:37,169
others and talking like do you have a

00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:39,270
tool in the Rubik group and a Peugeot

00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:41,100
for doing this and that and thought

00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:46,230
maybe we should do it during the day

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:51,230
instead of at the pub so the idea is

00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:54,809
that to have a buff probably it's called

00:32:51,230 --> 00:33:01,799
where the purpose is not to come up with

00:32:54,809 --> 00:33:04,409
some big guidelines and grants teams

00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:07,460
that all teams must change and follow

00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:16,230
and whatever but just to sit down and

00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:19,470
show tools to each other I wanted to

00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:26,010
mention that Shaun Witten has basically

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:29,549
a forked D H make purl to work on Emacs

00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:33,299
packages so there's a direct connection

00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:38,730
there so this kind of cross pollination

00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:41,130
is interesting I think okay so no one

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:44,820
thing thinks that's completely insane so

00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:51,390
I guess we took and felder can request

00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:54,059
the content team yeah maybe then you can

00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:56,549
also spread the word or if you have

00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:59,789
ideas who to invite from other language

00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:01,550
packaging teams like I don't know

00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:07,610
fighting guys maybe

00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:11,869
would also be interesting okay mmm

00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:17,869
another each issue which I titled now

00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:21,409
salvaging repeal packages well that's a

00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:29,960
bit me being me becoming grumpy

00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:33,080
sometimes so so last week I am you'd two

00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:38,600
or three fell packages which are not

00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:43,280
maintained by us for using debhelper

00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:45,409
for something and I realized that I

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,899
didn't even have to download the sauce

00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:51,050
package because the last upload was also

00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:57,350
an enemy mutant I mean last year for 522

00:34:51,050 --> 00:35:04,670
go and I think it's a bit silly to do it

00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:08,090
this way and I think either we I whoever

00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:12,320
wants to participate should just move

00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:14,660
those packages in the into the team keep

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,130
keeping the maintainer upload inviting

00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:21,820
them and whatever but just maintain them

00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:25,130
properly instead of doing this

00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:28,250
continuous and in mutants and if there's

00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:30,050
some some product consensus we maybe

00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:32,780
should as well announce this somewhere

00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:36,590
be that the lightning talk the weather I

00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:39,859
don't know we have a process for dealing

00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:43,520
with inactive maintainers already I'm

00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:45,440
not sure that we need a separate process

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,130
we might need to invoke it more

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:53,030
aggressively but I mean adopting

00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:56,140
packages if they're inactive can happen

00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:59,020
but I wouldn't want to try and sidestep

00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:08,430
the existing

00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:12,550
I say policy for that so so we should

00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:14,710
rather go for getting the package

00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:18,940
package is often first or something like

00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:22,119
that I think or at least not at least do

00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:26,110
them in my a process in parallel or

00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:29,710
something so so that it doesn't happen

00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:31,630
that they they're being MMI a goes

00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:36,850
unnoticed because we took over their

00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:40,619
packages or something yeah two

00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:45,550
interesting parallels and sounds good

00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:47,410
waiting for the MIT team to really

00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:52,210
orphan the package is something I'd like

00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:55,570
to avoid because then I mean waiting

00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:58,600
again if the current and my process my

00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:01,540
understanding is if even if you start to

00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,359
process by mailing that Emma a team you

00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:14,740
will not get reply so will you will not

00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:16,840
know what the state to contact the

00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,030
maintainer and we haven't Lee I don't

00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:22,119
think we haven't proactively been doing

00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:23,800
that before so the first thing to do we

00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,710
identify the set of packages that we

00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:30,910
think we're talking about and then

00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:34,300
contact those people right you you can

00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:36,820
yeah always contacted mi a team so I'm

00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:42,310
in the Emma a team since maybe a few

00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:45,160
weeks and so feel free to contact us we

00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:50,230
we have more streamlined process now I

00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:52,930
think has been also a result of earlier

00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:55,030
that calm and we are lately following up

00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:58,980
a lots of people which were not

00:37:55,030 --> 00:38:04,000
triggered and yeah just give us a note

00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:06,609
forward right a male who am I ate at q8

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,730
or TB on.org and we take a look at this

00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:12,820
you can also block on on q8 or even talk

00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:17,290
and take a look in the database if that

00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:19,480
is already recorded and sometimes yeah

00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:22,900
the list in that on is quite long so

00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,270
it's quite evident that you can just NMU

00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:29,350
that one and but in parallel we should

00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:34,300
to avoid missing of people follow the

00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:38,800
process here and I think in total from

00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:41,950
report to forced retirement let's say

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,640
that way it's not more than nine months

00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:48,940
and until you get the packages all

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:52,840
formed I think it's sewage treatment may

00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:54,850
seem um so and in the in that time you

00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:58,420
can trust Anna Mueller on and if that

00:38:54,850 --> 00:39:00,130
maintain I did didn't upload maybe five

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:03,880
years ago yeah

00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:08,250
over enemy was zero day you won't care

00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:12,280
probably so I just wanted to remark that

00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:14,440
it you said we weren't really contacting

00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,380
people proactively but Anna mewing

00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:20,530
somebody's package counts as contacting

00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:22,300
them if they don't notice that that's

00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,610
not really our fault

00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:29,410
I mean if you don't notice your package

00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:30,520
being in a mute that that's not that

00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:33,180
somebody's not trying to communicate

00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,320
with you I mean it's that you're not

00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,700
interested in the title or you know you

00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,960
have other things you're not able to

00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,960
respond or whatever but

00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,090
sorry but for the record that's

00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,490
something that's changed in the past ten

00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:00,860
years in Debian so it's now considered

00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,630
perfectly acceptable to make your NMU

00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,100
submission the means by which you

00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:09,590
communicate with someone who seems to be

00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:11,930
m.i.a yeah that's fine not the part I'm

00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:15,890
having issues with I don't hesitate to

00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:18,110
do any in the music so I'm more talking

00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:20,320
about this taking it to the next level

00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:23,810
and lowering this boundaries of

00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:29,060
maintainer ship actually I mean off

00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:31,730
records maybe but so okay so we just

00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:37,010
need a sense of what the scale of this

00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:40,550
is and do you have any do you have a lip

00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:45,920
a list of packages at this stage or

00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:49,660
maintainers so this would apply to I can

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,550
look in my enemy use directory

00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:54,830
so it sounds like we should write some

00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:57,230
scripts and then write some scripts to

00:40:54,830 --> 00:41:02,260
email those nice people gonna be my a

00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:05,660
team or maybe semi manually manually but

00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:10,100
yeah that's just a task that should

00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:13,150
happen well I have a fine Python script

00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,150
that I can use

00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:21,080
maybe we can write the Ruby script

00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:22,700
together CEA's way to feed it I think we

00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:26,900
should really try to work nodejs

00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:30,490
in to show that we're hip we've done

00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,490
that with the dev ematic web interface

00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:41,150
okay so it seems we have to look into

00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:45,620
this a bit more before having a clear

00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:48,950
group consensus a group policy and we

00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,960
have to think about this getting to him

00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:53,040
am i earlier finding those people who

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,910
vision

00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:00,690
okay I think there's consensus of

00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:06,090
aggressively mailing m.i.a of parole

00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:08,430
related packages it am I wrong No okay

00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,500
so that's I start I would just say let's

00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:13,440
avoid having a policy there's a team

00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:19,190
specific if we can in general actually

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:25,020
but but particularly in this case way I

00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:27,380
like to turn there and say under reacts

00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:30,600
extreme we see similar issues obviously

00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:36,510
so your policy would not be eating

00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:40,050
specific but maybe it works for larger

00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:48,600
teams it's this more practice than

00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:52,950
policy yeah okay good so and now we have

00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:54,480
two minutes left and we're more or less

00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:57,930
at the end I mean there's this link to

00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,990
our standing open tasks page which is a

00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:03,080
placeholder for we can now use the last

00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:07,820
two minutes to discuss any other issues

00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:09,900
topics which someone might have in mind

00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,140
we don't we don't need to talk about

00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:16,430
this here but I could use some advice

00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:18,810
and it's not a package that you maintain

00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:21,630
but it's somewhat loosely related and

00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:25,110
that is I'm notionally the maintainer

00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:27,810
for the parrot package which I built up

00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:29,160
a team who took over maintainer ship but

00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:32,010
they were mostly interested in Riku

00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,260
dough so when they shifted to the more

00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,760
VM from parrot they stopped maintaining

00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,430
the parrot package it hasn't been

00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,440
updated in two years there have been

00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:42,330
continuing releases of parrot

00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,040
I don't know how valuable they are to

00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:46,200
anybody I don't know that anybody's

00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:50,370
actually using it I'm wondering whether

00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,750
I should remove it or update it but it

00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,830
doesn't have to be discussed here just

00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:56,060
if anyone's interested I would

00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,060
appreciate advice

00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:11,090
good anything else nothing on IRC oh I

00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:14,870
have a small interest in the actual

00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:16,550
pearl package in the sense that I'm one

00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:23,120
of the commenter's of the Ruby package

00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:25,460
and it appears that our teams work a bit

00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,460
similar in that the interpreter itself

00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:33,190
is not part we are is not managed by the

00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:37,280
same team that manages the libraries and

00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:47,780
I was wondering why that is in the prowl

00:44:37,280 --> 00:45:00,110
team because we're very happy with the

00:44:47,780 --> 00:45:04,220
job that Dominic are doing mainly any

00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:07,480
help is welcome so so if somebody's

00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:14,510
interested yeah will happily accept

00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:17,990
contributors team members and all so I

00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:20,510
have one comment from IRC knowledge

junkie wants to relay his thanks to the
