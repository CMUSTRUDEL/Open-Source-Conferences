all right good morning to all Debian

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,690
developers contributors and users over

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,570
here I'm Germany and I'm here to talk

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,580
about my google Summer of Code project

00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:19,039
with a title improving voice video and

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,039
chat communication with free software

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,170
click on design

00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:56,340
I couldn't slightly to the next day next

00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,340
one

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,740
sorry for the technical issue okay

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:12,200
before I start my talk I would like to

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:13,910
introduce about myself and I'm an

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,380
undergraduate student studying be taking

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,530
electronic and communication engineer

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,959
engineering in nit warangal that's my

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,390
block I have documented about my weekly

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,030
report on mobile server of court in that

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,190
block and that is my debian wiki page

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:33,140
you can go you can know more about

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:35,330
myself in that wiki page okay before I

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,410
talk about my project I would like to

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:41,570
tell you a story how I'm here and I was

00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:45,650
how I was introduced to the Debian

00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:48,800
community so there is a place called

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,989
innovation garage in our campus where

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,220
you come up with new ideas and work up

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:58,459
work on it and there are many innovation

00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,959
innovative projects coming out so some

00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,209
of the projects I have worked on were

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,549
sensor based wireless well controller

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:10,519
for farmers and smart guidance for blind

00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:13,190
that was the talk I was selected for for

00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,190
says yeah it is the open technology has

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,650
premium open technological event and I

00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:21,890
had a talk over there

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,590
and in that event a division was a part

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,530
of it and I could meet Daniel Pocock in

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,410
the exhibition table and I could know

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,630
more about my debian know more about

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,610
Debian actually I'm new to dip in so

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:38,030
Daniel Pocock introduced me more about

00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:40,400
the Debian and I was interested in it

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,450
and we discussed about the jisub

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,070
projects under Debian and finally I went

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,230
back to the campus and prepared the

00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,910
project proposal and that was my first

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,760
application for google Summer of Code

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,940
and I was selected for it and I was

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,040
happy about it thanks for the Google and

00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:01,390
Debian for giving me a chance to

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:07,489
contribute to the open source software

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:09,200
ok that's it the story now I'll talk

00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:11,510
about my project

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,510
it's basically related to a real-time

00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,489
communication so before I talk what

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,150
about what I did I would like to tell

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,880
you about what I have learnt newly maybe

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,160
you would have you would know about it

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,290
but I just want to tell about the things

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,780
I have learnt within these two months it

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:34,630
has started on me and now we are done

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:38,780
with the midterm and I have passed it so

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:41,630
first real-time communication it is a

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,410
communication in which users can

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:51,890
exchange information instantly without a

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:54,560
bit minimum delay okay these are the

00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:57,230
examples of real-time communication text

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,810
messaging video conferencing colleague I

00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,320
hope you people are in Cape Town so you

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,940
will conduct contacting with your family

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,170
through some other so through some

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,700
software's okay how many of you here

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:16,430
using free software to communicate with

00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:19,250
your family from Cape Town okay so yeah

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,350
it's a good amount still we are working

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,990
on improving the voice that

00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,830
communication with free software so it's

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,990
still in progress

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,120
I hope you got to be able to use for the

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,110
next time in a Montreal with free

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,450
software yeah and this is the another

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,970
one website WebSockets is the heart of

00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:42,740
Realtek communication between client and

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:44,480
server it's a protocol and I hope you

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,310
know about free software I just want to

00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,880
introduce about free software as well

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:52,640
because we are using the a piece of

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,300
software for our project it's nothing

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,419
but you have the freedom freedom to

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,430
check a date change anything you can do

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,050
that's that's ofili's it's not like free

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,090
means yeah you don't need to pay

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,090
anything without money it's that's that

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,560
free as in beer it's like free as in

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:14,360
speech you have the freedom to do

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:18,560
anything with the software and the free

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:21,080
RTC means it's if the real-time

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,110
communication with the free open-source

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,970
software

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,900
okay now why do we need to use the free

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:32,360
software and that is a the other choice

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:37,940
first reason is resilience then security

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,440
and then privacy this way party is the

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,360
open source software for real-time

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,600
communication introduced by Google in

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,350
2013 Google i/o extended I think they

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,380
are still working on this project and

00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,979
these are the protocols used for

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:56,570
real-time communication first one is sip

00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:59,360
such an initiation protocol it's used

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,870
for signaling and controlling and next

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,100
one is XMPP

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,560
that is extensible messaging and

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,520
presence protocol it's used for message

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,370
oriented middleware

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,710
based Excel XML and the next one is a

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,389
peer-to-peer technology in that one you

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,370
don't have the centralized administrator

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:21,979
so it's everything is connected without

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:25,280
a centralized administrator okay so this

00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:28,280
is a comparison with SIP an XMPP is what

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,979
actually is both the same so a sip is

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,770
better better for using for the wise and

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:35,300
XMPP is metaphor using for the instant

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:39,950
messaging that's the only difference but

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,900
for the almost same and voice and video

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,150
over IP this is the basic technology we

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,660
are using in our project that is using

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:52,060
the software sorry using the internet

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:54,560
real-time communication okay these are

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,660
currently available real-time

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,419
communications in software's I hope

00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,889
mostly you will be using all these how

00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:07,130
many of you are using right now these

00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:08,900
are all yeah and these are not free with

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:13,120
the three free software you don't have

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:17,210
the freedom to edit or something that's

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:21,950
and you it is not a problem it is a

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:23,599
proprietary communication in my media ok

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:28,520
these are with a free software how many

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:31,760
you feel using any of these yeah so

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:36,020
these are the communication software

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:39,950
which are used created with the free

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:42,980
so yeah you can you have the freedom to

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,600
edit or make changes but still we have

00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,390
the problem with the lack of surface and

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,600
due to that firewall traversal can be

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:53,360
cumbersome so some some problems are

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,600
there so we are trying to our main goal

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,460
of the project is to avoid avoid using

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,730
this proprietary communication and

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,730
improving the available free software

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,670
okay I hope you all know about the IOT

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,670
it's Internet of Things these both are

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:16,310
the dominant field right now

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:19,040
I think this what field can bring the

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,500
world into your into your pocket I just

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,810
want to introduce both of them and this

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,000
is my goal these are our main goals of

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,400
our project avoid using the proprietary

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,890
communication and improving the

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:40,600
available free software okay now these

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:43,520
are the things we are working on first

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,130
target is just extracting the sender

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,910
receiver details from the mail so we

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:52,790
have extracted that one using IMAP and

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,950
the next one is if there is a phone

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,630
number in your mail old mails you want

00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,200
to just extract it and put it in their

00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,510
address book

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,100
you can just do you can just do it by a

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:06,760
click that's what we are working on and

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:11,270
these are the summary of what we have

00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:16,010
progress till now okay challenges I have

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:18,920
faced I'm new to Debian and I was I have

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:21,310
to use the Python for my project so

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,430
these are the challenges I have faced

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,430
thank you

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:44,480
any questions so I see that there are

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,880
free software alternatives for

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,040
communication but naturally things like

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,560
Linfen I'm guessing with the SIP you'd

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,209
still need infrastructure elsewhere

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,430
would you need private infrastructure or

00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:58,100
like is there public infrastructure for

00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,180
running things like Linfen and queue

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,990
talks and the rest of the things that

00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:05,660
were listed on the free software side

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,430
are they public service for that yeah

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:21,680
they do but they have some problems with

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:25,250
our servers and all lack of service and

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,649
if I may answer queue talks for example

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,660
and the ring which I am working on do

00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:33,860
not require infrastructure because they

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:35,600
are fully decentralized so if if you are

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,000
in the case where you have access to a

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,050
Rooter that supports UPnP there's no

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,810
reason why we you wouldn't need

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,610
infrastructure so these technologies are

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,810
really where I see the future is going

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,790
right now because even having a free

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,190
infrastructure does not mean that you

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,450
have privacy so we should develop

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,740
technologies that do not require

00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,740
infrastructure if you can

00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:16,119
we have a question from IRC how hard

00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:22,239
would it be to integrate RTC with the

00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:24,939
freedombox project how hard would it be

00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:40,979
to integrate free RTC with the

thank you for your talk

I wanted to reply this guy is like as I

00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:59,499
understand freedom box is pure Debian so

00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:03,449
is if your neighbor is in Debian then

00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:03,449
