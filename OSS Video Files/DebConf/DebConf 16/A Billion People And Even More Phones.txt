	00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:09,570
so oh by the next look that so sorry for

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,519
the small technical difficulties that we

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,870
had the rest of me is freezing but my

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,560
palms are sweating because of that right

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,140
now I think so my name is kisna

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,990
i am from india for all those of you was

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,510
here yesterday evening I think I had

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,490
given a shout out so maybe you have met

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,650
me then but if not I'm here to talk

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,769
about my home country and my home state

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,469
and Karen just left us a little bit

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,480
disappointed about how companies may or

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,329
may not be doing it for profit I think

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,399
it's a bit of a downer so hopefully my

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,100
story will cheer you up because I am

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,289
speaking about how my state has the

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,390
entire legislative and the government

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,640
has shifted to open-source so I'll come

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:56,489
to that and so I will start off with

00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:00,000
India so I hope everybody knows where

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:03,149
India is we are a South Asian region

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,470
it's huge colors taj mahai everything

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,810
that you can also see is within yeah

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,700
I've written in the first slide so the

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,689
population of India currently stands at

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,220
about 1.2 billion and it's a very small

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,189
place and everybody is jam-packed in

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,119
there so that has its own difficulties

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:23,340
and situations that we have to overcome

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,530
and technology is one of those things

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,460
that is connecting India right now so I

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,470
will give you a really fascinating

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,720
statistics so why India technology is

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,670
gaining ground in India is because if

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,409
you look at other countries which with

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,600
high levels of population obviously

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,000
China is first but they have a higher

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,220
level of technology penetration into the

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,070
population they have it about 70% I

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,159
think and USA is more than 90% so

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,040
India's seems to be South Asia I should

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,369
say with India and her nearby neighbors

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,460
Pakistan Nepal Sri Lanka we all come

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,439
together in the same subset so the the

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,320
penetration there is like 40 percent now

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,750
so there are lots large swaths of people

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,030
still left unconnected into the internet

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,459
so that is a huge frontier that the

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,740
technology our tech companies would like

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,670
to tap into so

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,410
and the funny thing is only 30% of

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,900
people in India have access to basic

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,390
sanitation but we have half a million

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,130
half a billion for cellphone connections

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,650
so that is technology has penetrated

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,540
more with sanitation in India so that is

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,280
the level of technology that we are

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,710
looking at and this is really half of

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,750
India so the rest of India and when the

00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,490
rest of Pakistan and people come in we

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,680
have almost a billion people getting

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,610
connected in the next few years that is

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,700
the amount of network and the the scale

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,160
of magnitude that we are looking at so

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,910
Human Resources so another thing that

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,560
India will have is the human resource

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,780
almost a large part of our population is

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,350
below 35 years of age and almost

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,000
everybody has a mobile foot okay so

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,950
everybody knows their watch setup and

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,770
their Facebook and everybody is getting

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,050
connected to that so if we can get that

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,180
population to be interested or at least

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,410
one person is of that billion to be

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,420
interested in open source software

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:20,100
that'll be a great boost I believe so

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:23,340
that's a powerful incentive and that is

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,620
why we have in the last six months alone

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,990
we have a lot of high profile tech

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,450
people visiting we had Tim Cook about

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,330
last month Mark Zuckerberg came there to

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:38,090
push his free basics it did not work we

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:40,980
voted him out so we all of us found the

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,380
Ministry of Telecom I told me do not

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,320
want a free basics no we want free

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,080
internet not free basics so there's a

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,820
huge swath of our new underutilized

00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,980
technical talents just waiting there

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,170
because of the population and that is a

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,230
place that we can really tap into so

00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,240
this is India and I'll come and I'd be

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,580
mainly talking about my state my state

00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,310
is this small little thing at the end

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:10,620
here is where I'm from it's more like me

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:14,430
so that is Kayla and I'm a mariely so

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,560
this is Kayla and I'm from an Natalie it

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,750
looks medium-sized in this map I suppose

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,359
but I Lachlan is the largest district in

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:25,350
Kerala and it's also the most developed

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,550
it's the urban center of Kerala so a bit

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,919
about gala

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,080
it where I'm from the land of coconuts

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,750
if the name translates to the land of

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,690
coconuts and inside that little slice of

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,449
land we have bird 3 behind cycroid that

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,490
is 35 million people living there so

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:43,680
that's a high density of population and

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,740
in Kerala is one of the most developed

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,470
states in India we have a very good GDP

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,470
we have the highest literacy rate it's

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,060
almost 100% primary education so a lot

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,240
of people in Kerala have access to

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,699
technology and that is why I think the

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,190
origins of FOSS in India has started

00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,620
with Kerala Kerala I think is the first

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,590
state in the world to have a pro

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,270
open-source policy it started in 2001 we

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,379
had a huge conference Richard Stallman

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,190
came I don't know about 2001 I was maybe

00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,280
six then

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,979
so I remember 2008 when there there was

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,530
huge conference and 2010 or something he

00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,759
came and I saw posters over there and my

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,280
mother was trying to explain where this

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,409
person was nor I noticed was he's a guy

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:33,389
but he has long hair that's what I

00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:36,690
noticed I was vacated so so all these

00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:39,090
huge conferences were held in 2001 2008

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,090
and 2011 there was a ten year

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:44,039
anniversary of the first 200 2001 and I

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,719
see first I see father's the

00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,909
International Centre for free and

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:49,440
open-source software it was a it was an

00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:51,270
institution created by the government of

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,849
Kerala and I think it was the first of

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,400
its kind to promote free open-source

00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:58,949
software by a government so that was

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,310
created in 2009 I am a student

00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:05,340
ambassador from I see first so I have

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:09,210
this really cool job of meeting people

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,830
in Kerala in an around Kayla and trying

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,139
to tell them about open-source software

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,389
some of them may like I am crazy we have

00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,150
Google we have everything and some

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,159
people we're interested and so I'm the

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:25,650
student ambassador from my district of

00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:28,169
Ernakulam so this is a screenshot of the

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,629
front page I see first we have a lot of

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:32,729
activities happening like every two to

00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:37,919
three months we have this workshop for

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:39,680
people so anybody can attend it's

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:45,650
usually it's free to have

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:48,740
all the people to attend and yeah so one

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:51,650
thing that led that happened because of

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,570
I see file this ID at school so idly at

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,940
school is the State Board the Karla

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,699
Kahneman board it introduced a lot of

00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,310
technology into its curriculum so we

00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:03,889
have like people in the 10th grade 10th

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,509
grade would be 15 year olds who are

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,120
starting to learn Python we're starting

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,820
to learn what forces and what technology

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,530
is so that's a huge leap and the

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,810
empowering thing about the State Board

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,849
is that there's an international vote

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,860
where all the college kids go to and

00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:21,110
CBSE the central government board that

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,090
the middle class goes to our state word

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,699
is usually lower income people are

00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,470
people that they want they want to go to

00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,240
CVC but they can't afford it so that's

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,669
why they used to go to state but these

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,919
days it's quality of education state is

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,960
so high that people and CBSE they don't

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,729
know what C is but people in the state

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,949
board they can program in Python already

00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:41,810
so the technology is really good that

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:45,770
they've pushed pushed it really well and

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:48,110
so Swatantra mandolin computing is the

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,630
local power house of computing that we

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,970
have Malayalam is my native tongue so

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,650
these guys what they do is they code

00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,900
everything in the need in our native

00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,500
tongue that is why mother Elam is so I

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,909
think Malayalam is one of the strongest

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,580
subway keys in Wikipedia because these

00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:06,289
guys they push they translate everything

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,500
into Malayalam this they're really

00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:12,199
malayalam centric people very religious

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:17,210
zealots of the language I'm not really

00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:19,159
that good so and because of SMC I'll

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,710
come back to startup village later so

00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:24,349
because of that our legislature the

00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,509
entire legislative body of Kerala which

00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:29,000
services almost 35 million people

00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:32,060
it moved entirely into free open-source

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,209
software it happened about 2014 I think

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,740
and there's a lot of interesting stuff

00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:38,870
about it because it's the first

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,289
administrative body in the world to move

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:44,810
into free open software entirely and the

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,640
mainly what convinced them to move was

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,380
that if you do it it will be cheaper

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,940
okay we are in denial signing up for

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,970
this

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:56,880
so and niyama Sabah is the Legislative

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,680
Assembly Nima means law in Malayalam so

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,380
named Isabelle is what our assembly is

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,930
called and all the documentation is

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,060
which was the four that is done in

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,339
Malayalam marilyn is a complex index

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:14,370
ripped it is the unwritten and rounded

00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:17,220
wobbles so you see SMC the part over the

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,200
left top that is Malayalam it's not you

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,450
can't write it in one single way like

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,640
you eat write it in English it has a lot

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,790
of different sub ways to write it it's a

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,310
bit complex and Malayalam is said to be

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:32,250
one of the toughest languages to speak

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,160
because we have all these slang words

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,600
coming and we have like a ruler it's a

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,899
lot of beautifies difficult to roll

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:45,420
their tongue like that and we have these

00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,010
are the specifications of the the

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,760
magnitude of the task that they managed

00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,500
so eighty operators and 300 pages of

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,360
text every day all that is done in

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,910
Malayalam and it's all done and so

00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,040
software and everything and then the

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,290
gunman's mandated that all the public

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,540
sector undertakings kc we are electrical

00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:08,100
board everything those are all done in a

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:11,130
system and we have an indica board

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,350
released so everybody can who wants to

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,209
use malayalam in their keyboard when

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,360
they want to type they can use a real

00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:21,570
and recently some these phones are also

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,700
so these things were released in 2013 or

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,880
14 so nowadays almost all these

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,279
languages are supported by Google and

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,500
Android this was then and that was a

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,209
significant milestone 10 and our

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,620
electricity board has moved to free

00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:37,200
source free open source software

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:41,190
solutions and the builds of their aura

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,000
is called unity in morale and satis is

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,630
simplicity

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,300
that's the accounting software yeah so

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:51,029
and I will come back to the startup

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,490
village so we they found out these guys

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:55,950
are really good at policy planning and

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:59,880
very interested in it so they found that

00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,529
a lot of the youth on an average a lot

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,150
of people pass out but there are not

00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,100
enough jobs for everyone

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,410
who passes out so they created this

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,300
thing called the startup glitch startup

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,300
village what basically it does is that

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,970
it enables a student who has an idea for

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,130
an interpreter ship so they support they

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,200
give a part of the attendance if you are

00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,850
working in startup village you'd get at

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,520
leniency in your attendance you get

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,990
leniency in your subject marks and they

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,760
encourage you and then there are a lot

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,250
of companies inside startup village are

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,560
people who are like just passed out or

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,570
people who quit their jobs to come and

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,610
start and all that and the government

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:38,490
gives them incentive they give them tax

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:41,910
cuts and startup village were started in

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,590
2010 almost I think last year also the

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,390
central government is also started it's

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,190
version of the site of village they're

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,680
giving tax breaks to all these startups

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,990
from the last budget onwards but our

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,380
barn was started in 2010 so I'm really

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,300
proud to talk about this and I have in

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,960
my own class I have classmates who have

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:04,140
their startups incubated in it I helped

00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,940
out I have friends with startup in such

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,240
a village with whom I helped out with

00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,830
content in fluent in development and so

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,690
that's about startup village strata

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,290
village is a place there is an actual

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,150
physical place in in Cochin where you

00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,030
can come and you can register but it

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,620
also provides online incubators so if

00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:25,020
you are in some other part of KL average

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,730
is not accessible or if you want to live

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,560
in your own hometown and you start

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,150
something then you can have that an

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,430
online version of this incubation and

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,260
they give you online support you have to

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,990
have Wi-Fi sometimes since it's India it

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,920
doesn't work in all but we adjust so

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:43,890
that's what started Phyllis's when

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,530
finally it is strict so it is strict I'm

00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:50,030
not sure of exactly when this was

00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:52,230
implemented but all our public service

00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,300
announcement and all that everything has

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,130
gone online and I believe it's all done

00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,200
and open-source software as well so if

00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,850
you want any documentation your birth

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,100
certificate death certificate marriage

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,410
certificate a darker other is a Social

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,320
Security number so if you want any of

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,450
these administrative documents or these

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,240
official documents if you want them for

00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,950
KL a government everything is online you

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,980
can give you a number and it's already

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,410
transparent so you can ask that

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,570
person and they have this 30-day policy

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,940
like if you don't get or do you have

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:26,630
asked for in 30 days the government is

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,810
accountable and so everything is online

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,070
then this is again this is morale for

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,260
all those who didn't understand this is

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,540
Miguel so that Marilyn is written and

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,400
you write it when printed malayalam

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,290
looks like this written my album looks a

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,610
whole lot worse sometimes even natives

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:47,600
can't read it we have early scripts of

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:51,020
Malayalam like India is very ancient so

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,540
Malayalam has been we have old scripts

00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:56,090
like Gita Mahabharata that is written so

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:59,710
in early times though those there are

00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:02,060
they have excavators have found

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,290
instances where all those things that

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,270
were written in Sanskrit

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,760
they were also written in a darden

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,130
script similar to ours so they have all

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,800
these research going into how we can

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:16,040
connect how all our languages have

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:22,910
evolved because in South India go back

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:25,190
to India right now yeah so all these

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,560
places in South India these four guys

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,420
they have almost the same that round

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,160
script but there's all we've all din

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,930
different regions so there is apparently

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,410
a common ancestor for all these regions

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:39,020
and so the all this data mining research

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,030
is going on into how we can find it and

00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,460
all that and so then Graham alarum

00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:45,980
computing is at these guys are pushing

00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,200
about how care mirela was the first

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,710
thing and nobody believes that but we

00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,500
are still trying to do it so and it is

00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,750
strict is that all the legislature are

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,300
all the papers everything that a person

00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:02,150
might need for any of their uses

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,430
everything is online all your grievances

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,790
if you want to talk to the government it

00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:10,370
those are all online so that's basically

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,950
it and I've given you some references

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,680
though all those screenshots you see

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:21,260
those are all live web pages if you

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:23,090
would like to know any of the websites I

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,710
can give them to you so that's basically

00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,690
it

00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,940
hopefully we're all a little bit happier

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:36,830
but some good is happening in the world

00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:45,320
so thank you I'll take questions if

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:48,050
anybody has yes often in Africa you'll

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,730
find that in Nigeria or something like

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,040
that you'll find someone that has more

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,410
than one telephone in their pocket is

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,060
that the case also in India yeah there

00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,340
are people with multiple connections

00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,680
obviously but the scale

00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,940
not everybody can have I mean if three

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,190
million three hundred million people

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,050
have and there are five hundred

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,640
connections you can assume that almost

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,230
200 people have double connections no

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,090
some people who don't care about

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,070
sanitation they care about mobile phones

00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,200
they want to have access to this

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,790
Facebook and Google and all that so

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,670
that's what the numbers was talking

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,230
about I think so it's a very glamorous

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,480
thing in India if you have a mobile

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:26,210
phone so people wanted more sanitation

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,680
it's a taboo subject so nobody wants to

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,660
talk about sanitation but if everybody

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,310
has a mobile phone which is streaming

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:56,870
the latest movie everybody wants their

00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:58,970
so I think it has for a long time but I

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,710
think for the past couple of years the a

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,510
lot of these restrictions have been

00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,460
relaxed we are trying to make our

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,870
economy more palatable to the outside

00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,210
world bring in more foreign investment

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,190
so I think the changes are happening

00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:15,440
right now so that people can get it

00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:17,590
easier than so any more questions over

00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,590
there

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,509
I'm just asking you know about

00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:26,909
Facebook's internet.org and I was just

00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:29,009
wondering if it's penetrated to Indian

00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:31,950
how much it is hope I do not yet

00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:33,899
Facebook's record internet.org where

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,269
they provide free internet access to

00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:38,820
Facebook I think no the Mark Zuckerberg

00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:41,399
came about three to four months ago to

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,619
try push a free basics to not to

00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:46,559
glamorize it to Indians and tell them

00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:49,409
that we here we have three basics but we

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,419
overwhelmingly we messaged the Ministry

00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:54,690
of Telecom and we told them that no free

00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,700
basics we want free Internet in the

00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,710
actual free sense not something but

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,080
Facebook is giving us we want we have

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,639
our right to free internet and that's

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:08,070
not what Facebook says it is thank you

00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:11,369
thanks a well I think my question is

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,590
somehow related to this as well you

00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:15,749
mention a lot that right the the

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:20,669
Internet connectivity is usually done

00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:23,700
usually a got to people through cellular

00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:26,519
phones now cellular phones are a great

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,759
way to consume but a very poor way to

00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:32,159
create so how how much does that

00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,049
translate to people having besides their

00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,029
phone which is a great tool to

00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:38,190
understand the world a computer with

00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:39,960
which they can create things I'll tell

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,730
you the answer that's a very significant

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,429
question because the problem with India

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,230
is that the urban population is

00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:47,460
well-educated but the rural population

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,340
is not so elasticated

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,529
so and all these programming stuff is in

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,299
especially in North India it is probably

00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:56,460
in English which they are very much

00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,649
unfamiliar with but in a mobile phone if

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,269
you can you don't need much to learn how

00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:02,460
to operate a mobile phone on how to

00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:05,309
access things in a mobile phone and you

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,289
I don't think they are in the mode of

00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,840
contributing it they are consuming

00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:11,759
YouTube they are consuming local videos

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,950
and all that and so that is given the

00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,929
main interest in technology so every

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,970
Google Facebook those are household

00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:20,580
names in India and knowing about

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,009
technology and wanting to know more and

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,629
explore technology is better than not

00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:26,850
having any technology at all I believe

00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:28,859
so I think change is happening it is

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,350
happening from the south to the north I

00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:33,270
think but it is and in the next 10 years

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,360
hopefully India itself will become a

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:39,720
powerhouse of us that's our aim this is

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,780
what we are working for any more

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,780
questions

00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:56,039
so the question from IRC is is there a

00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:58,230
mobile free software implementation in

00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,570
India at that moment was some projects

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,030
you'll be aware of can you repeat the

00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,820
question I didn't understand it

00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:07,380
unfortunately so the question was is

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,780
there a mobile free software

00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:13,590
implementation or project that you know

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:16,440
at the moment in India I'm belfry I'm

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,059
not sure about that exactly

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,890
there are probably India is a very

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,809
diverse place so whatever you're

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,400
searching for might probably exist

00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:25,110
because there are people from very

00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,960
different levels I mean there are people

00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,850
from just the top very brilliant people

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,640
the people who don't know nothing about

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,890
communication like we have those that's

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,049
the level that we are at but I'm not

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,809
sure exactly what the user the person

00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:42,030
who's talking about mentioning but

00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:48,090
probably it does exist I'm not

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:49,770
knowledgeable about it okay so if

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,970
there's no more questions I think we

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,020
should move on because the next talk

00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:57,480
will be in a few minutes

00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:59,220
thank you thank you so much if my

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:04,049
parents are watching I think they are a

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:06,919
shout out I hope I did well more thank

00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,919
