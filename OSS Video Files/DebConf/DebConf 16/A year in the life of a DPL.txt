so next up we have Neal a previous DPL

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,769
the DPL is a very opaque roll to some

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,320
people because the problem is you can

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,630
only know what it is to be a DPL if you

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,710
were actually a DPL so what Neal is

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,869
going through this morning share some

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,869
experience says that he had while being

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,279
DPL and what that all entails so please

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:35,250
thank Neil for taking the time to

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:36,230
prepare that can anyone here oh there we

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,730
go

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,030
so thanks very much any it's good to see

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:45,350
so many people here after ER that's Mike

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,030
how many less microphone now after a

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,829
rather good evening in the pub with lots

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,489
of food and lots of good beer so that's

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:57,120
good to see so I wanted to give a

00:00:52,489 --> 00:01:00,660
overview as to what happened over the

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,989
last year and the sort of things that a

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,810
DPL has to deal with now it should be

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,970
worth bearing in mind that every DPL

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,290
term is different you all have different

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,630
challenges to deal with and different

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,960
sort of things you need to do now I knew

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,530
that when I took over that it'd be a lot

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,130
of work and lots of talking to people

00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:29,659
but not quite how I imagined there's a

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,790
lot more of talking to other people so

00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:35,670
generally to the bits of media but also

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,170
lots of other groups lots of other

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:42,960
people within the free software

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:46,740
community so I wake up and I found I was

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,740
elected to the post of DPL my first

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,850
thoughts would break the code of conduct

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,329
so I'm not going to say what exactly

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:59,159
those were but it was quite exciting so

00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:02,670
that was certainly a an interesting time

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,920
now the main things you sort of get in

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,360
the first sort of well before you

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,759
officially take office is lots of media

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,629
requests so

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:17,290
I think I had IT wire I had Linux comm I

00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:19,030
had a my Linux desktop dog or something

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:24,720
like that and various different things

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:27,220
who all want varying levels of

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,959
interviews with you talking about what

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,840
your plans are and it's a really good

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,920
opportunity to promote Debian and the

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,680
sort of things that we're able to do

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,269
additionally you get a lot of spam now I

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,239
had some of this from from being home

00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:46,239
many over their current DPL is nodding

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,760
furiously I had a bit of experience of

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,129
this with being on the press at contact

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,730
and a couple of others but do you not

00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:57,519
only get all the spam from your leader

00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,500
at mail which is a fairly well

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,049
distributed email at the moment but you

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:06,609
also get all the press out spam and all

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:09,010
the auditor spam as well and donations

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:12,040
and trademarks and the rest you you get

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,049
spam you get a lot of spam and if anyone

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,120
really really wants to train their spam

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:18,459
filtering software with some really good

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,099
data run for DPL it's an excellent

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,810
excellent grab so you have to wade

00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:25,480
through all of that there's also an

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,519
archive of the previous DPL mails which

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,919
is really useful so you can run through

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,699
that and find out and find out even more

00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,260
spam which is great so that was kind of

00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:39,819
the first day with us was wading through

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,230
that day one I have a lot of days to go

00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,359
through so I'm hoping everyone is

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,090
feeling sitting very comfortably at the

00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:49,019
moment so they won no look at that sort

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,879
of speed up a little bit so month one

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,760
within a month I personally released

00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,580
Jesse

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,870
I'm claiming that I'm claiming that no

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,530
one is going to take that away from me

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,299
it's all my work but hey we released

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,049
Jessie now that was an absolutely

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,730
fantastic experience to have loads of

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:12,090
fantastic press loads of coverage from

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:16,199
everywhere I appeared in a video

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:19,590
conference call to Debian India they had

00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,180
a huge cake unfortunately they didn't

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,130
think they could ship any to me anyone

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,260
would still be a in an edible state but

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:29,160
that was a that was a great fun thing to

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:33,210
do more interviews again lots of this

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,500
sort of happens and yeah so there's

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,330
certainly quite a bit of press around

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:42,260
there then you had sort of three kind of

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,900
issues which should come over from

00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,490
Lucas's term so of legal issues which

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,900
you have to deal with once around the

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:56,130
PHP license essentially the PHP license

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,410
says it only applies to PHP and derived

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,360
works now if you create a program using

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,849
this license there's then confusion

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,900
because the license can't actually apply

00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:08,699
to the software that you've written be

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,750
all and end all of that is essentially

00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,490
we are going to publish a statement on

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,110
the Debian website somewhere saying

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,419
we're going to ignore that bit because

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,639
it doesn't make any sense that serves as

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,949
a useful legal to stop or to say well

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,260
it's absolutely ridiculous we can't do

00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:29,760
anything about it so things are fine so

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:32,639
hopefully that will move forward sue Lib

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,880
DVD CSS is more interesting one we got

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,840
very close to being able to accept this

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,220
certainly in the form that we'd worked

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,039
out and then Japan came along and it

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:50,370
appears that in Japanese copyright law

00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:53,490
so it's Japanese copyright law around

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,979
him DMCA is fantastic so they've taken

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,199
DMCA and then added bits on to make it

00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:01,860
even more complicated even if it wasn't

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:07,050
before so this was there's some language

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,780
in there around machines which well

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,900
operate

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:13,150
which facilitate the making of apparatus

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,150
which facilitate copyright infringement

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:19,930
so this is to stop people making

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,070
machines which clone cards for cable TV

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,410
or something now

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,470
that then becomes a problem for Debian

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:30,010
because Debian is that mechanism which

00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:33,700
then distributes live DVD CSS which then

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:35,410
can be used to potentially view movies

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,389
which you have legally bought on

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,710
whatever computer equipment we have

00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,120
legally bought and obviously this is a

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,610
terrible thing and we should block this

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,210
apparently but that's where we are so

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:49,840
that is as yet unresolved and I really

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:52,919
really don't want to advocate going down

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,530
the path of creating a non Japan dot

00:06:52,919 --> 00:07:00,210
Debian dog because non-us dot that being

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:04,960
in alcohol was so easy to deal with and

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:07,050
then ZFS I'll get onto more of that in a

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,050
minute

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,430
so spending money was also a useful

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,919
thing when I came into term I said we

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,200
need to spend some money so lots of

00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:20,260
requests came in so I proved all those

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,780
and pretty much without I think without

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,330
exception I think not what I mentioned

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,820
more money in a minute and the other one

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,430
which probably people don't know is

00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,500
around DD certificates I don't know if

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,430
Reddy's had any of these yet but yeah so

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,620
as a without wanting to add too much

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,740
more to Timmy's workload as a Debian

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,690
developer you can email the DPL and they

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,630
will sign you a special certificate to

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:50,229
say you're a Debian developer this can

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:53,680
take some time just with the volume that

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:55,090
that's certainly I got each one

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,039
individually doesn't take too long but

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,280
just the processing of those when you

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,600
have various other bits to deal with is

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,410
interesting be great to automate that

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:12,539
some way so that was kind of month one

00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:12,539
month two until the end of my term

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:23,730
I'm working out how hard to rant about

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,830
this I'll be good I'll give a bit of

00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:29,580
background as to as to where we are with

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:34,230
this and how this came about so four

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:39,150
days in to my term I receive an email

00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:42,630
from John Sullivan saying ha so I've

00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:47,930
read that debian are interested in I've

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:52,380
worked out a way of distributing ZFS and

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:54,960
there's major concerns with this to the

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,420
state that depending on exactly how we

00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,910
do it this could create major problems

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,470
for Debian and could essentially send

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:06,060
huge ripples through through the

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:10,440
community there is no doubt I think that

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:14,820
the license that ZFS is distributed

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,220
under CD DL is a free license but in my

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,270
mind and quite a few others these

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:24,210
licenses are not compatible with the GPL

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:28,100
so there's a lot of back-and-forth lots

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:31,700
of trees and prose essentially we'd

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,660
received some legal advice from the

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,460
software freedom Law Center I think

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,700
Lucas originally sent in the request

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,110
around what can we do with this does is

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,930
this compatible or how does this work

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:47,340
what do the licenses say and we got back

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,980
quite a lot of text I'm not entirely

00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:53,970
sure it was the exact question we asked

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:56,370
because for those who have dealt with

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,890
lawyers I'm sure you you may recognize

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,150
some of this but but we asked about how

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,180
these license compatible can we

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:07,140
distribute it and the answers we got

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:11,700
back I will summarize as saying you're

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,860
not going to get sued which isn't

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,860
exactly what I wanted to know but fine

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,250
so not only if we did get sued then it's

00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,170
unlikely that there'd be any damages

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,030
because Debian doesn't have any money

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,300
I'll get onto that and moment as to

00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,980
exactly how much money Debian does have

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,240
but it's unlikely that anyone would want

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,840
to sue Debian it would be bad publicity

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,790
etc but that wasn't the question that I

00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,750
wanted to know I wanted to know how

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:44,150
compatible these licenses were so we

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:47,220
received that advice I then had lots of

00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:49,260
meetings with John and from free

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,590
software foundation Bradley from

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:56,060
Conservancy and FTP masters and the

00:10:52,590 --> 00:11:00,930
maintainer and everything and eventually

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:05,280
we get to this truce shall we say where

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:10,290
we work out we shall distribute it using

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:12,930
DKMS in a contrib repository now contrib

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,750
is an interesting place for those who

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,700
don't know what contrib is we have three

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,030
main suites in Debian one of those is

00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,920
main main consists of programs that

00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:26,160
should fully free and can be distributed

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,460
and essentially uphold our Debian free

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,980
software guidelines non free is for

00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,460
things we're allowed to distribute but

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,370
don't meet those guidelines in between

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:41,250
there you have some a bit of a gray area

00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:45,000
things that are free but depend on non

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:48,650
free stuff or somehow the licensing

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,820
doesn't meet a self inclusive Meng an

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,860
example of this so this doesn't just

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,080
have to be licensing either this is also

00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,050
around functionality because remember

00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:01,980
many years ago early in the debian days

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:05,400
we had scummvm which is free but only

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:08,730
existed to run what at the time was non

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,590
free games then beyond a steel sky came

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,300
along as free game and excellent it

00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,430
could go into Maine so the point of

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:20,280
contra is not just a licensing thing

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:23,700
it's around usefulness itself we talked

00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:26,580
to after I talked to FTP masters big

00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,130
thanks to noodles as well who helped who

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,510
helped with some of this as they I'm not

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,800
going to call him a lawyer in training

00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:36,440
but he has been doing a law degree

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,440
recently so make of that what you will

00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:43,000
and essentially we we worked out the

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:46,480
point that there is a promise we make to

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,149
our users when they use Maine you can

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,769
take Maine you can apply DFS G to that

00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,079
you can modify it

00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:58,779
and as long as you essentially send the

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:02,019
source on etc you're going to be okay

00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:06,670
and you can send this to your friends it

00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:08,170
is entirely unclear that's probably the

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,170
political way of putting it but it is

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:16,779
very unclear as to what happens if you

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:18,790
take ZFS on Linux combine it with a

00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:22,149
Linux kernel and then distribute it to

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:26,079
your friends because it is a binary

00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:28,990
format so no one entirely knows exactly

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,360
what that means so we would be breaking

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,649
that promise to our users hence this is

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,769
why it's going to end up in in contrib

00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:42,189
so excellent so we have a wonderful

00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:44,230
position that works Conservancy are ok

00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:46,540
with it free software foundation are ok

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,860
with it FTP masters are ok with it and

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:53,110
their maintain is ok with it

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:59,949
fantastic it goes into new and then a

00:13:53,110 --> 00:14:01,660
bun to publish a statement a bun to

00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:07,769
publish a statement saying they're

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:15,819
shipping the binary on advice from a

00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:18,970
senior free software lawyer this starts

00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:20,920
to make me quite annoyed for those who

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:25,769
don't understand Britishness quite

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,769
annoyed is well go go look it up

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:35,700
search yeah it put me off my tee I was

00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:38,460
mildly miffed because we had worked

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,140
really hard to reach this point where I

00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,910
mean the original positions I think of

00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,340
Free Software Foundation and shout at me

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:47,220
John if I'm wrong is don't chip this at

00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:51,420
all and the important point is here is

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:55,200
not around CD DL being a free license or

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:59,460
even being a proprietary license if we

00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,080
allow a GPL incompatible license to be

00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,810
linked like this in the Linux kernel and

00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:07,830
distributed as binary that is exactly

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:10,260
the same legal preset as binary non free

00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:12,150
modules as proprietary modules what

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,010
we're talking about here isn't around is

00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:16,550
it a free license or not it's an

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:19,130
incompatible license if we allow an

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,600
incompatible license no matter how

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,630
wonderful we may or may not find the CD

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,460
DL that is our defense to stop binary

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,550
proprietary modules being loaded with

00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,140
the kernel and distributed with the girl

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,840
it's the thing that we use to stop

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,140
essentially proprietary software

00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:41,580
appearing and not being able to be used

00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:44,580
on our devices so going back there was

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:49,950
this wonderful announcement I was then

00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:52,970
asked by SFL see if they could publish

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:56,550
the advice that they had sent Depp in

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:59,520
saying we won't be sued I thought this

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,350
was quite odd so I asked why and a lot

00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,840
of the commentary was around well if we

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:08,220
if we publish this then Oracle won't sue

00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:11,550
Debian I can't see Oracle suing Debian

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,460
to be honest at all ever but so that was

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,050
quite odd and I thought but why would

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,870
you do this this this goes against the

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,450
position that your client the Debian

00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,670
project has taken which is no it's not

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,370
just about the legality it's about the

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,380
morality of combining these two things

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,450
and Debian has always been keen to

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,410
remain a free software distribution and

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,410
keep it that way

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,630
so then an opinion piece comes out from

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,370
this

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:44,110
sf LC which looks very similar to the

00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:50,230
advice would receive to accept with

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:54,160
Debian's name filed off this saga is

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:56,800
continuing it hasn't finished yet it

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,760
will continue for a long time I just

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:04,810
hope that us as Debian recognize our

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:08,170
role within the wider community and work

00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:13,329
not just as Debian not just as Debian

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:15,069
vs. Fedora not just as SPI versus SF LZ

00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:17,470
versus Conservancy or free software

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:20,860
foundation this is an issue which is

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,230
important to all of us who care about

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:28,449
software freedom and the ability to use

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:35,730
our devices together enough of a rant

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:39,610
about ZFS delegations I could be wrong I

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:41,860
believe I'm probably the first DPL who

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:48,010
ended with fewer delegates and they

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:50,730
started with so press publicity bits got

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:53,140
combined into one this is now just the

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,790
fantastic I have to say publicity team I

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,740
don't know if anyone's dealt with them

00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,600
recently but they're incredibly active

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,800
and the amount of stuff we're getting

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:05,670
now is is absolutely wonderful yeah

00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,670
thank you very much

00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,850
especially if you're listening to the

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,420
stream at home I think Lauer is probably

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,970
there hello

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:20,770
auditor got changed into the treasurer

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:23,560
delegation this was a slight confusion

00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,840
with rope they started getting emailed

00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,050
saying can you please audit our programs

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,490
and makes all their secure or something

00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,900
for people who are handling monetary

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,910
books this was a little bit confusing

00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,990
for them so just to highlight this all

00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:40,890
differences here this is now the

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:40,890
treasurer front desk got D delegated I

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,560
spoke to damn I think at a mini Deb comp

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,790
in Cambridge they wanted me update the

00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,190
delegation because they were changing

00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,480
people or moving people around

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,160
I asked what they wanted actually

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,580
delegating and then we realized there

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,780
wasn't anything to delegate it was just

00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,950
running a process and looking at

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:08,830
applications and not making any

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:11,010
decisions then debconf chairs now this

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:14,580
one was fairly contentious and I'm

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:19,440
particularly sad that I wasn't able to

00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:22,210
help deal with this during my turn

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,870
essentially it's a the role of Deb comp

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:30,060
chairs is a very difficult job and so is

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:33,070
organizing all of Deb comp how do you

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,440
ensure that there is accountability to

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:38,440
the project for all what you're spending

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:41,320
project money on but at the same time

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:44,460
allow the local organizers of a of the

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:48,370
event to actually get on and run it and

00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:53,020
do - and create a great event that we've

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:55,170
all come to expect sorry Maddie a fun

00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,760
one for you dealing with Deb comp chairs

00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:01,200
so I've handed it over to him so hope

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:07,660
we'll see where he comes from there hmm

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:11,170
easy subject darling excellent then in

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:15,090
my final bits for the mail I delegated

00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:17,650
for four hours the Debian trolling team

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,270
this was given to Paul tag and it had

00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:23,170
one power only

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:26,590
which was to declare what color t-shirt

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,600
the DPL shall wear now I was clever

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:32,080
enough to time-limit it because over

00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:36,490
those four hours well there was a few

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,920
changes of shirts shall we say and you

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,090
can probably see sort of the lateness of

00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,300
the hour throughout the evening at the

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:45,460
first all happy excellent great then

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,110
getting very tired and by the end of it

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:53,559
what the hell I'm running out of

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:59,770
t-shirts Oh punch someone ego well

00:20:53,559 --> 00:21:01,030
possibly poor tag money in my platform I

00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:07,360
said we have too much money and we

00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:10,510
should spend it now every request that

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:15,570
came in I replied and said spend the

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:21,100
money already people said can I have

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:24,160
2000 euros for a sprint I said have

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,960
let's go up to 2500 euros because I

00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,429
don't want people coming back again and

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,020
saying oh we went over the budget by a

00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:35,410
hundred euros or so did a lot of work

00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,690
with Debian system administrators as

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,730
well to get things like new disks

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,970
improve hardware things like this so

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,950
this is just the money at SPI in the

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,620
various earmarks that we have and so

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,600
very priorities to say that with this

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,640
great amount of spending that I

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,970
authorized and told everyone to do we

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,830
ended up with more money then we started

00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:10,820
with the game

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:16,350
oh sorry

00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:16,350
[Laughter]

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:27,440
so Samara was saying Marga spotted the

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:31,730
deliberate mistake I put in my slide to

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:36,049
make sure everyone was awake end of

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:39,289
April which I kept today it's a special

00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:42,380
day it's a very special day in this case

00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:44,659
but so anyway we ended up with once

00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,370
again more money than we started the

00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:52,960
year with so I'd certainly encourage

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:52,960
people to donate him or his good

00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,480
fundraising went through the SPI account

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,279
so a lot of that money is already

00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,960
earmarked for debconf right yes but it

00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:18,950
was also earmarked for the previous step

00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:23,529
Kampf okay so it and over to you also

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,529
get more money during that sure so yeah

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,620
isn't there another problem with a date

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,029
since one year off boss because we start

00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:38,360
in 2015

00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:38,950
um no that was my term No

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,039
[Laughter]

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,039
[Music]

00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:56,520
[Applause]

00:23:49,860 --> 00:24:04,690
14 15 15 15 16 so that works yeah okay

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:06,130
but the numbers are right anyway so it

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,610
was very late last night and very early

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:11,320
this morning hence the coffee but um

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,650
yeah so we still have quite a lot of

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,910
money

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:22,260
we should probably spend some of that

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:25,390
that'd be a good idea yes stand up

00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:33,520
so Doug confident Hawaii Deb calm Hawaii

00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:35,620
apparently that's only help so yeah so

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,660
anyone who's interested that the thing

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,000
was the presentations for debconf 18 are

00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,650
on Friday if you want to propose Deb

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,299
Kanpur why that would be fantastic

00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:49,210
especially as it's summer back at home

00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:52,929
and winter now in Cape Town although

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,400
it's been reasonable a little bit cold

00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:56,260
and raining a lot so a lot like a

00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,480
British summer anyway so I feel quite at

00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:05,830
home other bits which we wanted to do

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:09,549
bike sheds the new name for PPAs as FTP

00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:12,160
masters decided to call them I think it

00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:15,640
came from original joke which I made in

00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:18,850
in in one of my talks and they kindly

00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,919
decided that apparently my humor is so

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,179
bad that it can be named turned into a

00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,720
code name for something we do

00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:28,240
technically as I understand it the bit

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:32,309
slower left here is stuff to do with

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:38,620
wanna build and how that integrates and

00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:41,049
hopefully at some point maybe by 2020 we

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,360
will get bike sheds I'd encourage anyone

00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:46,710
who is particularly interested in this

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:50,350
go talk to embrace path ABBA

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,730
he's not here excellent so I can I can

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,980
volunteer him to be the point person

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,950
here go talk to him try and work out if

00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:01,750
you want this yes

00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:03,700
ready does it work yeah

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,290
I suggest anyone interested to go talk

00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,570
to a young John Woo who is the

00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,620
maintainer of the wanna build and the

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:15,550
beauty Network today

00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:19,000
excellent over eons on l32 good that's

00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:23,230
the next stage for that I think that did

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,350
work quite well is outreach so certainly

00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:28,780
with the outreach team I think I said

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:32,050
Debian will guarantee a minimum of four

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,700
slots per session and so that's gone

00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:36,250
really well it's something I was keen of

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:39,730
and trying to increase the amount of

00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:45,640
outreach we do and making sure that we

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:49,450
can do that excellent I do have some

00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:53,710
time for questions as well so there's

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:57,400
lots of people to thank particularly

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:59,830
like to thank at this point Lucas I know

00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,770

these three organizations free software

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,000
foundation and the free software

00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:29,140
conservative software freedom

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,890
Conservancy even trying to who were able

00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:34,330
to support my role not only with just

00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,490
questions and interacting with the rest

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,970
of community but a good amount of moral

00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:44,440
support as well these people know what

00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:46,990
it is to be the figurehead for a large

00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,360
and public organization so particularly

00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:53,380
John Karen and Bradley from the Free

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,880
Software Foundation and and Conservancy

00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:58,720
particularly like to thank them

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,020

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,020
thank you

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:08,510
and you know I said Debian house money

00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:14,600
well these sort of people are ones who

00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:17,690
also help uphold software freedom within

00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,010
the things and quite frankly they also

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,380
need money to do it

00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,420
so go join these people if you haven't

00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,760
already Conservancy for example this

00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,560
week if you join this week then there is

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,930
a generous donor who's going to match

00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:33,140
your funds so I encourage everyone here

00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:35,780
to sign up for them also if you're at a

00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:38,240
conference and Conservancy are there

00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:41,300
they throw an awesome cocktail party as

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,670
well for people with some rather des low

00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:46,160
budget low budget but you will get the

00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:50,540
exact director of the of Conservancy

00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:52,910
cooking you chili also like to thank my

00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:56,360
employer and kelabra who were absolutely

00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:58,010
fantastic during the year there are

00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,380
actually I think for the first year this

00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:07,060
time a gold sponsor of Deb comp which

00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:09,800
was really handy so unfortunately due to

00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:11,930
South Africa via customs we didn't have

00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,750
our usual bump at the jobs fair and

00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:16,280
stuff like that which is now arrived so

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,410
thanks very much for the auditing for

00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,690
like driving down to the depo and

00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,010
picking it up and the rest of it so

00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,750
there's loads of stickers and things

00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,540
like that and is there anyone from the

00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,310
orga team in the audience cover your

00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,720
ears

00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,700
because we've also got these flyers and

00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,070
on the back of the Flyers they get made

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:38,810
into paper aeroplanes absolutely

00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:43,610
fantastic it says it says air debconf

00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:45,260
apparently so yeah everyone has a

00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,610
permission for a flyer and then to turn

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,200
it into paper airplanes so that's

00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,720
fantastic so I'll shove those Allen

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,940
things yeah

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,620
the responsible person says that that we

00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:59,620
can all make paper airplanes so that's

00:29:54,620 --> 00:30:03,160
great so yeah I guess that's it for me

00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:06,590
we have time for questions I believe I'm

00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:09,340
not seeing a yellow or red sign Oh ten

00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,340
minutes excellent

00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:23,980
one at the back thanks for the summary

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:27,620
while seeing these FSF software

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,720
Conservancy logos over there did you

00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:32,270
make any progress to see well

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,030
interpretation or stubbornness sorry

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:38,150
about did you make any progress about

00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:41,570
the well in that interpretation of the

00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:43,910
GFDL that seems to be some kind of

00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:47,900
stubbornness on on the well maybe

00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:50,420
FSF side maybe auntie debian side but

00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,810
it's not in the interests of I think our

00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:55,100
users not to ship documentation to ship

00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:58,070
Freight documentation

00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:01,100
just because license to say well there

00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:04,670
are invariant sections about back and

00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:07,490
front cover texts and maybe we can keep

00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:09,560
this up going again while well all

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:14,060
involved people are here at that

00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:20,240
conference yeah so the yeah thanks Aria

00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:24,110
so this is one of the I think the FSF

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,810
and debian have similar let's just

00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,810
actually minor disagreements about what

00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:33,950
we think is free and what we're trying

00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:37,730
to produce I think this is oddly the one

00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:39,350
area where Debian is trying to be more

00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:42,290
free than the free software foundation

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:44,750
in this particular case now the

00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:46,430
wonderful thing about this talk is that

00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,910
we have people here who can answer that

00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:52,619
so John

00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,619
[Applause]

00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:08,599
we are working on it I you know

00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:10,089
personally I want to see everybody like

00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:12,289
decorating up stuff on the same page

00:32:10,089 --> 00:32:14,089
particularly about definitions of what

00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:17,149
constitutes free and not free software

00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:20,359
documentation material I think that

00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:23,559
we've had a good several years ago

00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:26,329
actually of just good conversations and

00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:28,609
figuring out how to move forward so

00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:30,619
that's obviously one of the more

00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:33,799
complicated areas that's been an issue

00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:35,419
for quite a while but you know we're

00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:38,409
interested in talking about it I've

00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:43,190
gotten very good responsiveness out of

00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:45,320
Lucas and Neil and Zach and had chance

00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,089
to meet Metis here too so I think that

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,919
we'll continue to have very frank

00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:51,579
conversations about everything it

00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:51,579
hopefully make some progress

00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:06,800
great so it seems a to spend a fair

00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,320
amount of time work working on ZFS also

00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:12,410
I was wondering if you one idea I have

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,320
for a long time is that we might may be

00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:19,340
useful to have some kind of Debian legal

00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:22,040
advisory team people who from inside

00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,840
Debian and that could collect the advice

00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,200
from all organizations that provide

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:30,710
advice to the young and just build up

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,510
the values proposals dig this up to

00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,130
listen to let Judy PIDs I don't think it

00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:39,320
makes sense to delegate the poor to

00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:40,820
decide on business so so one thing that

00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,240
I think would be particularly

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:47,000
interesting is increasing Debian's

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,660
options for who we can get legal advice

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,070
from certainly as in my term we had a a

00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:57,590
new pro bono legal advice around

00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,720
trademarks which is Marie who's been

00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:02,060
helping us with trademarks there's

00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,980
various options I think we have because

00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,230
I think the traditional saying is if you

00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:09,530
put three lawyers in a room you'll get

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,940
seven different opinions so certainly

00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,510
that's only useful and that kind of

00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:16,580
interestingly touches on a question of

00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:19,370
that I think the project needs to think

00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:25,399
about which is what does the project

00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:28,610
want from the DPL the DPL is a

00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:31,070
interesting position where it's not

00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:35,120
entirely clear what's expected there I

00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:37,100
mean is this a Administrator who make

00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,790
sure and checks all the finances and

00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:43,520
unimproved things like that or is it a

00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:45,399
spokesperson who goes and does a lot of

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,169
press events in terms of who defense is

00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:51,940
and talks to various different

00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:55,970
organizations or is it a mediator who

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:58,250
goes and deals with conflict within

00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,750
teams sometimes even within packages

00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:04,220
I've received some of those which is

00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:08,540
tricky and I'm not convinced that this

00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:10,080
is a role that one person can take on

00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,030
especially if they're not working

00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,770
full-time on the job and be able to

00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:18,300
achieve everything that that they want

00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:19,710
to I don't have the answer to this but

00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,980
it's certainly something that people

00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:26,180
should think about when it comes to the

00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:30,120
DPL role and and what's expected of them

00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:32,730
I think we have time for one maybe two

00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:40,640
short questions if anyone else has any

00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:50,670
of those we've got five minutes no oh

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:52,470
yes so what was the most rewarding

00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:57,170
single interaction you had with somebody

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:59,790
during your term and what was the least

00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:06,390
was the most unleased rewarding

00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:08,280
interactions I had probably I think the

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:12,920
most rewarding I mentioned already which

00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,920
was that video call with Debian India

00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:19,620
they actually had I think eight or nine

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,090
release parties all at the same time or

00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:25,200
which were equally packed so being able

00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:29,310
to appear and represent the project over

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,290
there was fire eventually once we tried

00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:34,200
seven different video streaming systems

00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:37,200
and ended up with I think I used a

00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,600
gstreamer pipeline over a socket to a

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,460
web thing it was horrible eventually we

00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,770
got there that was absolutely fantastic

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,330
and seeing this massive cake which which

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:52,230
they which they're baked for for the

00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:56,270
Debian release the not necessarily the

00:36:52,230 --> 00:37:01,560
worst but the most annoying I think

00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:06,230
interaction was from a least rewarding

00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,230
least rewarding least rewarding is a

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:17,370
member someone who used to interact with

00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:19,620
the project quite a bit and doesn't have

00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,670
access to the BTS or various list

00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,420
servers at the moment

00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:32,910
emailed me and said what's happening to

00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:36,180
the team survey for the I TS yes so that

00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:38,099
is a bit of a what eventually I managed

00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,589
to decrypt that this is actually talking

00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:43,049
about the bug tracking system and the

00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:48,720
team survey is something that was about

00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:50,279
ten years ago when Steve did it someone

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,089
believes that it's entirely

00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:56,519
dysfunctional and the bts's team are all

00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:59,369
rubbish and aren't doing any jobs and

00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:02,700
are annoyed at being banned still so I

00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:08,220
received a number of emails from this

00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:11,789
person I wrote back I was going to write

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:14,760
back and then eventually I decided that

00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:20,880
this is not going to stop anything so I

00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:23,789
ignored it very very quick what's the

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,289
most bizarre interaction you have what's

00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:27,289
the most bizarre interaction I've had

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,309
the most bizarre interaction I had was

00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:39,299
before I took office I walked into my

00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:43,440
local running club which meets in a pub

00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:47,099
obviously because we're British turned

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,170
up and then six or seven people I know

00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:52,079
said hey congratulations let me buy you

00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:55,380
a pint for being DPL which was great but

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,900
it's all emphasized to me actually what

00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,539
a big deal debian is and how much it

00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:03,029
actually is influenced beyond just the

00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:04,859
free software people we know people rely

00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:05,519
on it they really use it and they love

00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:08,039
what we do

00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,539
and want us to carry on doing that and I

00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,119
am out of time now so I'll just say

00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:14,460
thank you very much for a fantastic year

00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,069
it's been a hell of an experience please

00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:19,519
if you think about running do so you

00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:19,519
won't regret it

00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,650
