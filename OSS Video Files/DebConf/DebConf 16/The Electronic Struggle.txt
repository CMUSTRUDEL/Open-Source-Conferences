all right so I think it's time to start

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,870
okay good afternoon ladies and gents my

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,400
name is David Robert Lewis summer

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:23,400
activist technologist and journalist and

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:29,689
I'm here to introduce you to the

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,689
electronic struggle before we start

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:37,969
I've got to give you a disclaimer this

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,519
is not a chat about distributed

00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:42,199
denial-of-service attacks

00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:45,410
it's not about tools such as the ping of

00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:49,550
death email bombs clobbering servers

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:51,769
with HTTP calls and so on and this is

00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:55,850
definitely not a talk about penetration

00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:57,409
testing I was some of the material in

00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:02,059
the events related here may refer to

00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:07,220
previous epoch time when that kind of

00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:09,710
thing was considered legal ordinary even

00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,900
de rigueur so if any of you feel

00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,540
uncomfortable about the content of my

00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,909
discussion most welcome to leave the

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,750
room I'm hoping that you're gonna stay

00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:30,079
with me and I'm gonna take a journey

00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:33,700
back to ancient times back in the day in

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,079
the late 80s early 90s

00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,920
institutions such as University of

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:46,189
Capetown was connected by you use CP

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:48,560
UNIX and NTP pop mail links go for most

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,899
of those facilities were under lock and

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,350
key if you were enrolled in a ph.d

00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:57,590
program in the right faculty you had

00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:00,999
access to what was then also referred to

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,999
as the Internet

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:12,120
at the same time that you had your

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,140
campus organizations that have using

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:20,060
systems that were point-to-point

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:22,920
protocol we have your mailed unloaded

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,230
transferred maybe twice a day if you

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,970
were lucky other servers and other

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:35,100
institutions and other servers there was

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:38,300
a free bulletin board seen you know

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,950
anything about the bulletin board seen

00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:46,200
it was also a point-to-point protocol

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:51,030
and mainly on on personal computers on

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,340
the on the good ol IDM 80 xt computers

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:59,370
that you have to boot up with a floppy

00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:02,310
disk I've got my first copy of IBM dust

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,269
from the computer lab on campus I she

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,670
sneaked it out I'm it's a computer

00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:11,790
science student in the afternoon you

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:15,239
think gave me what you would probably

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:20,790
consider an illicit copy of a operating

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:25,680
system that is not aunt antiquated so

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:28,230
long with firm the free BBS system I've

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,390
got it just frame it for you thee this

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:34,650
is a period of campus unrest 1987 the

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,400
whole of university of captain was

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:44,519
closed down as a result of unrest

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:47,670
student revolt and the South African

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,860
Police the apartheid regime was waging a

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:55,320
war of attrition against communism and

00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:59,640
they came onto campus to give the

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,670
communists on campus a lesson and their

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,110
schambach students in the library tear

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,940
gassed the campus there's some

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:12,769
interesting pictures of UCT enveloped in

00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:16,680
tear gas helicopters flying overhead

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:21,780
riot police so I got caught up in the in

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,979
throngs of this whole unrest I was a

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,150
naive students have I've been

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,860
politically active

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:30,000
I joined various organizations and

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,100
during that that same year the

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,199
organization such as the in conscription

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,000
campaign various other new SAS

00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:41,820
affiliates were banned by the Minister

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,240
of security and so that's just some of

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:50,130
the some of the context of this so while

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:53,599
the anti-apartheid movement was

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,340
organizing against the apartheid state

00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:59,849
you have the emergence of a variety of

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,680
networks that helped us to connect the

00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:05,910
anti-apartheid movement with the outside

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,039
world so what is significant about this

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:12,470
time is that the arose a a bulletin

00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:14,580
board system known as working it which

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,770
was really in opposition to the

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,710
government sponsored videotex system

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:24,389
known as belt L which was based on a

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:28,789
French system if he were a law abiding

00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:31,080
citizen you could order a belt L system

00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:35,550
there's a picture over the oven

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,840
something very similar and so the big

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,090
corporates and the banks and the

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,919
apartheid regime delivered information

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:47,280
via the sort of read first and

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:50,909
information system people who were now

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,949
opposed to that system and I must admit

00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:55,860
I never actually got to use a bell tower

00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:59,820
system it would be quite interesting to

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:02,789
hack into it I know Julian Assange and

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,699
he's he's got a novel detailing some of

00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:07,680
his exploits and one of them is using

00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,190
what was an Australian very similar

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,849
Australian system to hack into NASA and

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:18,030
the Pentagon and so on so III came out

00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:21,720
of the bulletin board system that were

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:27,150
connect and I used work nets or dial-up

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:30,330
into working it and connect to green net

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,849
peace net you connect I'd read my news

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:37,099
just on the Indian tepee system which is

00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:38,490
the network news transfer protocol and

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:41,159
there are a number of organizations

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:44,400
which are worth means mentioning the

00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:47,939
computer education tape computer so it's

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,819
the community education since a Cape

00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:55,949
educational Computer Society right and

00:06:50,819 --> 00:07:00,080
the other organization is the computer

00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:03,090
resources project I'm known as Crick

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,229
these are two organizations on the Cape

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,520
Flats and if you know anything about a

00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:12,440
part science it was a system that

00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:16,710
segregated people according to race I

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:19,139
started out as a white person and soon

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:22,020
find myself being disenrolled from the

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,729
white race as a result of my activism

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:30,120
and as a result of my fraternization

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:35,610
with people of color I found myself on

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:38,159
the wrong side of the law and if you had

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:42,360
a time machine you could go back to the

00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:45,240
1980s and if you went to Creek or Kicks

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,199
Artin at lone you might find a person

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,949
such as Douglas reader and a modem also

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,870
dialing in to working it and organizing

00:07:51,949 --> 00:08:01,830
unlevered issues on social justice

00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:04,409
issues so quite it's quite it was quite

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:10,169
a frenetic period the townships were

00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:12,779
burning there was unrest and the the

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:15,089
media outlets really carried the big

00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:17,849
story of you know our political leaders

00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:22,500
if w de Klerk and nelson mandela and the

00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:24,900
negotiation surrounding the the end in

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,509
game settlements what people don't

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,919
realize is that while nelson mandela was

00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:31,500
being released people were still being

00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:36,839
arrested and still being tried and put

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,640
on trial for activities so along with

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:43,079
the bulletin board system we also had

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,149
the the single monopoly operator called

00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:48,350
telecom

00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:51,529
which provided a one-size-fits-all phone

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,079
service it was really just one one shade

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:57,730
of beige the device that you could order

00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:57,730
from Telecom and you'd get a bill and

00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:05,329
significant about that period and the

00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:09,470
80s was the emergence of your PBX

00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:12,980
systems your pay lines gaming lines and

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:15,499
sex lines so if you happen to read the

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:19,449
classified section you'd find a bunch of

00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:23,779
adverts advertising various gaming lines

00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:26,509
telephone informational services that

00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:31,629
took money off your belt and you dialed

00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:31,629
into those pay services by your phone

00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:42,160
let's go onto the next slide okay we've

00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:42,160
got a bit of an animation all right so

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,170
the problem of the part site was that it

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:54,800
wasn't just something that happened in

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:57,139
isolation it has a history and one of

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,860
one of the ways of looking at that

00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:02,990
history is through technology one of the

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,999
companies associated with the regime was

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:08,709
a company known as International

00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:11,410
Business Machines and it itself it was a

00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:15,319
what you could call a repeat offender

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:18,740
IBM are notorious for aiding and

00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:25,639
abetting the Nazi regime particularly

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:28,459
the census data that was used to gather

00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:29,980
information on your German citizens

00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:34,730
during the 1930s

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:37,480
what's it important I'm about it let's

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,480
just look at the

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:50,630
the sky Herman Hollerith in the 1880s

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:53,750
was in United States citizen he came up

00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:57,310
with a tabulating machine using cards

00:10:53,750 --> 00:11:00,440
punch cards this is the early early

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:05,750
information processing systems of that

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:08,630
time and I've been being a merging

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:13,100
global company ended up with a

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:15,200
subsidiary in Germany known as Deutsche

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:21,590
Hollerith machine and kachelle shafts

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:24,800
dirham Ark 1910 so we ready before

00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:28,730
Hitler had arisen to power there was the

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:33,320
power provided by the technology to

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:38,290
achieve ignoble ends the so you had a

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:44,150
simple card system tabulating system

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:46,280
that was then used by a regime that had

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:50,030
based its race theories on earlier

00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:52,340
scientific racism you might know of a

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:57,560
science called pseudoscience known as

00:11:52,340 --> 00:12:01,630
eugenics so Hitler proceeded to

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:04,420
implement a information-gathering

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:09,620
experiments on the German population and

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:15,110
gathered data such as your ethnicity

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:17,750
your height and so on and use that that

00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,090
information particularly notorious in

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,800
the in the in the german death camps

00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:27,260
which also known as concentration camps

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:30,220
and so as a Jew I'm quite fascinated by

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:34,240
the way that technology has been used by

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:38,960
fascist regimes to control populations

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,980
the apartheid states which began in 1948

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,720
and ended in officially in 1994

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:48,290
similarly gathered information on its

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,950
population we'd used similar data

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:54,110
processing equipment also designed and

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,540
produced and leased by International

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,960
Business Machines

00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,760
and I'm gonna get into the the case

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,790
there's a long-standing case but before

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,850
we get there I've got to relate a story

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:10,240
it's a personal story of related to my

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:14,200
activism because in 1989 I wrote a

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:19,030
letter to what was then a sort of a

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:22,290
cyberpunk magazine produced by Queen

00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:25,990
moon are you serious to West Coast

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:31,390
personalities it was transitioning from

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:33,840
it was previously known as high higher

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:38,740
space or something here it's space

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:42,220
anyway um it became Monday 2000 in 1989

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:47,890
and I ended up with a letter published

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:52,600
in issue 2 of mondo mondo 2000s under a

00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:55,240
pseudonym and detailed in general terms

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,090
the problem relates to the personal

00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,470
computer where you could old XT and 80

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:04,360
and the use of this new technology

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:07,720
emerging technology at the time to

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,640
apprehend and surveil activists there

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:15,010
was a particular incidence where a

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:16,630
couple had gone to an ATM and their card

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,920
issued by the bank had been swallowed by

00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,410
the Machine and they've gone into the

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,200
bank to retrieve their cart and the

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,980
manager the branch told them to wait and

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:30,470
of course the system was rigged to

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,710
inform and the Special Branch

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,540
[Music]

00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:37,090
apprehended them so there was a bit of

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,630
consternation as to the what the new

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:43,210
technologies were being used for by

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,700
their parts I extent bear in mind that

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,240
this was a state that had as a

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,290
transpired had death death squads and

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,750
there was particularly incidents at

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:58,420
flack Palace which is detailed but in

00:14:52,750 --> 00:15:01,510
the truth commission final report so my

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,540
general activism around the use of

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:06,340
technology by the state turned into

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:11,710
something quite interesting because

00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:13,930
the arose a case in the aftermath of the

00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:19,210
truth commission and the inquiry into

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:19,750
parts I arose this case that is still

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,630
ongoing

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:25,390
it's one of the longest-running cases in

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:30,100
in in legal history it's in the same

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:33,460
same same status as the survivors of of

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,610
the Holocaust and it's son as we know

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:40,450
apartheid was a crime against humanity

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:44,589
so what is it to be said about the IBM

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:48,070
case well as we stand they are to two

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:51,520
significant cases there are two groups

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:55,029
of individuals the one is not such a

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:58,240
large group and recently this year the

00:15:55,029 --> 00:16:00,960
case which is in so Baeza versus IBM and

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:06,420
also for the Ford many motor car company

00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:09,580
that case has been as essentially

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,460
expired it's come to its it's as far as

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,200
it can go through the United States

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:17,160
legal system it's a trench in the set

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,930
there was a number of petitions because

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,770
all the litigations based upon the Alien

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:26,550
Tort Act which allows and it's in its

00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:29,320
form as it stood allowed foreign

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:31,240
individuals to sue United States

00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:35,470
corporations that you could prove that

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,839
the u.s. corporation had intent and had

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,540
some are engaged in gross violations of

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,490
human rights the problem with the with

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:46,710
this litigation is that there's been a

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:50,589
trend towards limiting the ability of

00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:53,980
all the aegis of the Alien Tort act and

00:16:50,589 --> 00:17:00,060
a court one of the lower court's found

00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:04,600
in favor of IBM and Ford's company and

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:10,780
so it's turned ready into a very complex

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:13,540
a very complex piece of litigation the

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,939
if you read the documents which have

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,459
been filed by the the bigger group which

00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:19,699
is the column Ani case which they

00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,929
represent some and

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:27,069
thousands survivors of a part science

00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:29,720
many of them were victims of torture and

00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:32,929
various rights violations some of them

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:39,139
are widows and orphans of activists who

00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:41,750
were killed in at flat glass if you look

00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:45,019
at the the manner in which the documents

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,789
have been filed in my in my honest

00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:50,120
opinion as a late speaking as a

00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:53,080
layperson and as a journalist it appears

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:56,799
that the the case has been filed with

00:17:53,080 --> 00:18:00,230
regard to the what's known as grand

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,389
apart science it's the the problem of

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,600
the D nationalization of South African

00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:08,480
citizens who were classified as black by

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,730
the government if you know anything

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,419
about apartheid one of the policies was

00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:16,669
to remove black citizens from

00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:19,960
citizenship so that you had a white

00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:23,120
country and then you had these homeland

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,100
states that were supposedly independent

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,899
homelands none of which were recognized

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:32,779
by the international community so the

00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:36,100
problem of proving intent it's a lot

00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:38,840
easier to prove the census information

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,809
and the gathering of census data such as

00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,110
race criteria blood line and blood clot

00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:47,330
criterion the issues of blood quantum

00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:50,510
and I'm someone who's fallen foul of of

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,580
this pseudoscience where I've been

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,860
myself have been disenrolled from the

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,960
so-called white race and as a result of

00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,880
issues of blood quantum and as you know

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,279
it's very difficult to prove you look at

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,320
your DNA it's very difficult to prove

00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,529
that there is such a thing as race

00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,679
because the science tells us that innate

00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:12,169
some adaptations such as hair and skin

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,600
color are not indicative of a separation

00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:18,220
between the species we are all

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,220
biologically speaking the same species

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,620
all right

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:45,799
I'm a person who went from the Apple

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:50,539
Revolution Apple to revolution the small

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:54,080
BBS movement and working it and shortly

00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:55,309
after Chris Hani was a the lead of the

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,279
Communist Party in South Africa was

00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:01,730
assassinated I ended up in self-imposed

00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:07,009
exile on the west coast in the United

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:11,559
States of America so the end stages of a

00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:17,240
part sight I was out of the country 90

00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:38,110
we've gone one step ahead I think there

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:38,110
we go sorry way back again yeah

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,390
that these cilia animations I thought I

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,390
was being clever

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,350
all right are we going back again

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:27,059
I think I'm just going to click on the

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:32,210
in actual slide and then ask her to show

00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:32,210
me start from current slide

00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:51,340
all right it's an animation that's some

00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:56,020
doings right okay so we don't have a

00:21:51,340 --> 00:22:01,990
picture the picture by the way is just a

00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:03,880
picture of two kids at Club Med make a

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,820
trip Alice on the west coast with a

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:10,170
power book 180 very similar to the one

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,170
that I was carrying around at the time

00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:18,790
so what happened in nineteen ninety-four

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:21,610
surprise surprise the we went from the

00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:25,990
the BBS systems where you had

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:30,910
point-to-point protocol to a totally new

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:33,250
way of communicating the tcp/ip protocol

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:36,600
essentially as far as I'm concerned it

00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:39,669
was an engine the introduction of the

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Internet as it editors commonly referred

00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:48,700
to because instead of going to point a

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:52,590
point you were issued a your IP you

00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,970
could you could produce her own IP you'd

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,730
instead of going through a bulletin

00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:04,150
board you go directly to a server where

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:07,000
you were given a IP address and as the

00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:09,520
same time we had Tim berners-lee and the

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,230
worldwide wish which was also the

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:17,080
worldwide wait I had an account that's

00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:20,440
on a bulletin board running UNIX it was

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,419
Berkeley Berkeley UNIX and it's quite a

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,630
popular bulletin board known as the

00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:27,730
whole earth electronic link so all of

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:33,460
this was superseded by the World Wide

00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:35,500
Web myself I experienced the unbundling

00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:40,059
of of Mozilla and Netscape Navigator

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:43,450
which arrived on my public 180 as zipped

00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:44,980
files that I've downloaded from they

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,260
were actually given to me by West Thomas

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,620
who was then the editor of wonder 2000

00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,090
and

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:55,179
[Music]

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:57,429
unzip the file next thing I'm surfing

00:23:55,179 --> 00:24:01,630
using a graphical you know user

00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:03,580
interface and there wasn't much that you

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:10,059
could do there were a couple of other

00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:13,380
online like Rick online and a couple of

00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:18,179
places but most parts of it was a

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:21,429
totally new frontier you could log into

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:23,230
the academic community so I logged into

00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:26,620
still emotion University from the west

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:33,730
coast I could surf the card catalog in

00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:37,500
at the institution and this new world of

00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:41,020
the internet presented all sorts of

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,750
opportunities as an activist I thought

00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:47,470
this was an amazing opportunity to

00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:50,050
engage in what what became known as

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:55,030
hacktivism the word hadn't been coined

00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:58,179
time but in 1994 people might might know

00:24:55,030 --> 00:25:00,250
this if you're old enough the Prime

00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:05,710
Minister of Great Britain man by the

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:07,330
name of John Major he implements these

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:11,110
government was a conservative Tory

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:15,820
government implemented a series of laws

00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:20,110
which outlawed music with the repetitive

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:22,240
beat outdoor criminalized outdoor music

00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,400
festivals and it was really aimed at the

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,190
underground rave culture scene at the

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,050
time which was if you might know about

00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:34,120
it was based on electronic music and

00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:40,300
became also later known as the trance

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:44,550
music scene so what happened I was part

00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:47,890
of a bunch of infinite's

00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:51,730
activists and ravers who grouped

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:54,790
together and we at the point being a

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:58,330
bunch of kids we we were known as the

00:25:54,790 --> 00:26:02,760
Zippy's Zippy's stands for Zen inspired

00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,879
Pro noid profound for peace professional

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,829
pride

00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:09,759
the sneaking suspicion that the universe

00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:14,049
is a conspiracy on your behalf so our

00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:16,719
tactics we get crashed a book launched

00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:19,029
by late term Leary he was launching a

00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:21,609
book on chaos and cyber culture you

00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:24,429
jumped on the bandwagon and technology

00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:26,619
was the new drug so dropping the

00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:29,109
internet or hooking into the internet

00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:36,429
was the next best thing to taking acid

00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:39,969
and I what did i do I I hacked into his

00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:43,149
accounts on the well I managed to get

00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:45,429
hold of his password which I believe or

00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:51,819
thumbs my memory serves me right this

00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:56,709
password was smile squared and we forced

00:26:51,819 --> 00:27:02,289
mr. Leary to email bomb his arch enemy

00:26:56,709 --> 00:27:03,789
John Major with a protest message the

00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:08,699
morning and end to the criminal justice

00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:11,199
bill probably with being the first

00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:12,940
person or the first bunch of people to

00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:17,589
do this was there was no way of knowing

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:19,449
what the reaction would be this is an

00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:21,489
hour a year before the Italian net

00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:25,299
strike which was also an online protest

00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:27,549
and it came after if you reach it is a

00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:31,149
scientist book came after the it was an

00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:36,190
internet worm which broadcast messages

00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:38,979
anti-nuclear messages so what was the

00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,529
next thing that happened after we were

00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:43,059
trashing John Major and her majesty's

00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:46,209
government

00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:49,359
HMS John Major and it's a criminal

00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:51,219
justice bill and also likewise see

00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:56,859
seeing and becoming a total nuisance

00:27:51,219 --> 00:28:01,929
disrupting MPs communication pinging

00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:05,190
servers and and and and removing their

00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:08,109
ability to communicate with the

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:14,489
electorate was of course there was a

00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:16,730
counter strike so I ended up with the

00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:21,590
conversation with

00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:24,650
and matter name of mark healey you if

00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:29,350
you are from San Francisco you might

00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:31,550
know mark healer Healy as an expert UK

00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:35,090
person you relocated to the west coast

00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:37,550
and became involved in the dance culture

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:42,140
the nights nightlife scene he had a

00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:45,080
magazine so I end up with a telephone

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:49,700
call crapping on me because the more

00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:53,270
servers had that we had used as one of

00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:58,070
our bases on the internet the more

00:28:53,270 --> 00:29:03,440
servers had now fallen over as a result

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:06,080
of the data coming back after we had

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,830
sent a lot of data a lot of page calls a

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:13,940
lot of pings and a lot of really large

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:17,300
files as part of pop through the pop

00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:19,430
servers all of that ended up in the more

00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,070
servers going down and of course morph

00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:24,290
was a community that had come out of the

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:26,540
the bulletin board scene it was a

00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:29,060
community a lot of people where there is

00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,520
some LGBT community or the rave

00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,440
community whereas other communities so

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,940
everyone was irate that we were being

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,100
bad cyber citizens that our activism had

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:45,280
essentially created a disruption of the

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:51,790
communication needless to say the feds

00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:55,790
decided to once again crack down on the

00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:59,510
field of the day which in if you read

00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:04,720
the press and if you looked at highly

00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:06,860
watch Hollywood movies the hackers were

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,420
the enemy

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:13,750
and there was a witch-hunt against the

00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:17,540
use of computers people were adolescents

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:20,690
teenagers using computers and causing

00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,520
disruption on on the Internet and one of

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:25,430
the individuals who was unlucky enough

00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,370
to come up against the federal

00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:30,590
government and I believe it's because he

00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:34,460
had done some penetration

00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:37,039
and he had copied also files it you'd

00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:41,870
essentially stolen information as far as

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:45,200
I I know but kevin Mitnick was a member

00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:47,809
of the alta 2600 hacker community and

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,759
the feds really came down hard on kevin

00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:52,970
and he ended up with the trial bar

00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,830
hollywood crazy thing about it was that

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:59,809
Kevin was arrested on my birthday which

00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:04,730
was so the intervention of the UK was in

00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:07,070
September of 1994 1995 and the 15th of

00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:11,210
February

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,769
kevin Mitnick was arrested there was a

00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,259
tribal hollywood and he ended up serving

00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:17,480
hard time hard labor in a State

00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:22,690
Penitentiary and ended up with the

00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:25,389
long-standing campaign to release Kevin

00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:31,279
the intervation

00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:34,369
which was a public event at the seminary

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:38,720
book launch was covered by Berkeley free

00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:41,269
radio you based in Oakland and later or

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,240
so it was a couple of articles appeared

00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:47,840
in hak block but for the most part that

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,470
entire experience has been deleted we

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,330
don't exist if you read Wikipedia even

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:57,679
the Italian net strike doesn't exist

00:31:53,330 --> 00:32:03,499
activism summer starts in 2005 you read

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:06,559
your wikipedia another points I want to

00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:08,090
make about this period that I spent in

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:12,610
the West Coast was described and they

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:17,090
were full sermon 1991 release day a

00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:21,379
piece of software known as PGP pretty

00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:26,210
good privacy and under the Clinton

00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:30,139
administration in Al Gore you had a

00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:38,119
couple of attempts to stop the the

00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:41,409
encryption of information and yes there

00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:45,040
was a case against Phil Zimmerman for

00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:57,680
PGP the only free to leave

00:32:45,040 --> 00:33:00,020
she wake me right pgp was created in the

00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:04,460
in the shadow of the Clipper Chip the

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:07,250
ASCO it was a genuine meter meters way

00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,980
of explaining the problem of

00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:12,050
surveillance and the fear was that your

00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,450
chips that you had in your phones or

00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:18,140
your computers would be used to record

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:20,690
your conversations and to surveil so PGP

00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:23,510
was now the supposedly the solution to

00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:28,040
surveillance United States government

00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:30,410
cracked down on PGP the reaction from

00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,420
the community the crypto freak community

00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:36,410
and the cyberpunk community was too real

00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:38,780
to upload copies of PGP on every server

00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,190
that they could possibly imagine and the

00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,950
result was that the United States

00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:47,560
government was forced to drop its case

00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:51,010
in 1996 the the case involved

00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:54,140
restrictions on exporting crypto

00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:56,270
restrictions on the type of crypto that

00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,850
you could have there was a NSA standard

00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:01,490
that they thought that ordinary citizens

00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,920
shouldn't be in possession of and they

00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:08,230
tried to essentially make it a crime to

00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,230
to be possession of pretty good privacy

00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,310
all right

00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,010
so when I returned back from exile in

00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:29,680
1995 I was all fired up by the crypto

00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:32,330
Wars and early hacktivism again a

00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,970
private campaign ready to create

00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:36,730
awareness around the internet and around

00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:40,000
issues to do with access to information

00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:45,140
privacy and information freedom I

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,790
attended a an event hosted that the ika

00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:50,990
fair which no longer exists it was a

00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:55,030
first internet cafe internet cafe was a

00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:57,170
big scene at the time long street and

00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:02,650
there's a picture that's me right there

00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:07,130
at the in front of a monitor campaigning

00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:10,150
minister paolo giordano in an event

00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:14,480
which was the first time that a MP had

00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:17,660
used IRC to communicate with the

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:23,300
electorate so a bunch of us at the eye

00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:26,090
cafe including Steven Garrett chatted

00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,940
online the very first time using a new

00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:34,070
technology of the internet with our

00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:38,090
Minister I fax Jane I do who was also

00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:40,370
Minister of Communications and what is

00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:43,490
significant about this period 1995 is

00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:47,000
that after 1994 which was the first

00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:50,840
democratic election where a majority

00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,240
government was elected it was a period

00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,520
in which we engaged as the country in

00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,840
writing a piece of legislation which

00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:03,770
would become known as the Bill of Rights

00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:06,800
I it's just a note yet that I also

00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:08,750
handed mr. Jordan who attended after the

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,570
chat session he arrived with his

00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:16,640
entourage Peter Jordan was really the

00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:19,250
ANC ambassador at the United Nations and

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,240
it was quite a significant persona in

00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:25,460
terms of the history of this country so

00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,230
he arrived and I handed him a copy of

00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,839
the virtual community Behar drawing

00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:33,400
and there was an effort to really

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:40,160
educate our politicians about

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:42,770
information rights and we ended up with

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,930
a document which is very much a document

00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:48,290
of its time it's a document which was

00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:52,270
written in the light of the rise of the

00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:54,800
Internet and the dot-com bubble so we

00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:59,300
ended up with very two very interesting

00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:01,280
pieces of legislation in there in the

00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,700
Bill of Rights there's article 14 which

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,570
is the right to privacy ie the right not

00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:11,260
to be surveilled not to be exposed to

00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:14,839
intrusions by our government or by

00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:18,920
commercial entities and then article 32

00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:21,470
which is it's a sub the the access to

00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:25,400
information clause is a sub clause of

00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:26,300
our the freedom of expression I feel it

00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,240
would have been better if there actually

00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,859
had a completely separate clause with

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,069
number one being access to information

00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:35,660
but be that as it may we have an article

00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:37,369
in our Bill of Rights

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,770
access to information which is defined

00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:42,710
as the freedom to receive and to impart

00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:46,160
information was very much based on the

00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:48,740
model of a modem dial-up handshaking

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,720
itself with the server that any

00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:56,480
interruption of that relationship was

00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:00,859
which was considered sacrosanct would be

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:04,790
a violation of our Bill of Rights I sent

00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:08,740
a letter to Wired magazine and needless

00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:11,210
to say my letter was extracted and

00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:14,839
turned into slippered authored by some

00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:18,099
other individual about the the new

00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:20,119
rights that we had in our country where

00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:22,550
previously I don't think there was any

00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,069
nation on the planet that had gone so

00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,950
far to protect information access and

00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:30,589
privacy rights through through

00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:33,349
legislation the bill was signed by

00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:35,530
Nelson Mandela on 31st of December 1996

00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:41,140
and this year marks the 20th anniversary

00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:41,140
of the founding of our Bill of Rights

00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:52,330
result was a 15-year reprieve from

00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,330
obnoxious intrusions on privacy and

00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,150
violations of freedom of access for the

00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,730
most parts

00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:10,820
our country has respected issues such as

00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:12,080
net neutrality right they've been a

00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,830
number of important precedents

00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:19,730
protecting users rights to information

00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:21,380
access it's been very difficult to clamp

00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:24,170
down for instance and on so-called

00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:27,800
copyright offenders difficult to

00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:31,400
regulate traffic and ice fees on the on

00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,320
by larger project it from liability

00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,230
the Internet's generally considered a

00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:41,360
human right and I'm not going to go into

00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:45,640
my Lewis versus Big Data my piece of so

00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:49,180
I get to the next very important slide

00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:53,390
so for 15 years we had a reprieve from

00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:56,930
oppressive laws after nine when when

00:39:53,390 --> 00:40:01,580
things went from relatively okay to

00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:03,500
quite bad we saw the rise of rica which

00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:07,130
is the regulation of intercept of

00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:09,890
interception communication act which

00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:11,690
allows our government to spy and just to

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:19,610
gather information over the mobile

00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:24,140
networks in 2010 a proposal by the man

00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:25,790
by the name of Malusi Gagarin was if it

00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:28,490
wasn't defeated it was it was

00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:32,890
essentially shelved because of activism

00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:35,600
a person such as myself the gobber's

00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,950
draconian piece of legislation would

00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,480
have essentially created a national

00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:45,830
firewall very much like Communist China

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:49,100
after the elect the polyarny conference

00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:52,590
of which elected Jacob Zuma to the

00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:56,610
presidency and just a note Jacob Zuma

00:40:52,590 --> 00:41:00,780
as a background as a man involved in

00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:05,790
intelligence is a organization called

00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:09,780
mccordle so after Poliquin we've had

00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:12,150
several pieces of laws that all violate

00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:15,780
the premise and principles in our

00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:19,730
constitution and each one of them pretty

00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:23,100
seriously and they've all been proposed

00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:26,040
in 2015 there's the Forman publications

00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:28,680
regulations bill which has been labeled

00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,000
by the EF F which is not the local

00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,130
political group at the Electronic

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,360
Frontier Foundation as Africa's worst

00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:38,100
new internet censorship but it corrects

00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,230
paid census and places all media under

00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:42,420
prior restraint under the guise of

00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:46,740
curbing child pornography and sexual

00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:48,420
deviance it's also in visitors gathering

00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:53,540
of fees for online content distribution

00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:55,560
as a new source of unlimited revenue

00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:58,380
it's essentially physically impossible

00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,300
to enforce the law because it will

00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,610
create a massive bottleneck and as we

00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:05,820
know the terabytes of information and

00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:07,830
data that coalesce around the internet

00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:10,490
from a daily basis would just pile up

00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:12,810
outside the woman publications board

00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,780
there they would never have enough our

00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:17,480
human hours to vet all the information

00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,550
that would come under the aegis of the

00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:23,130
legislation there's another bill which

00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,930
is particularly noxious which is the

00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,630
cyber crimes and cybersecurity bill also

00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:30,500
introduced last year which the mayor use

00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:32,820
of computer were opening a terminal

00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,820
creates grounds for suspicion by the

00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:39,540
authorities the vault essentially treats

00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:42,690
UNIX and Linux as a virus as any other

00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:46,830
net tools that you find commonly used on

00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:51,810
Debian somehow scary stuff that needs to

00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:54,330
be dealt with by the lawmakers the bill

00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:56,490
in its current form allows for

00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:59,460
extradition of so-called cyber criminals

00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:01,700
re suspects and the problem with the the

00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,680
manner in which the bull has been framed

00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,270
it creates a situation where the federal

00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,570
government

00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:11,010
and Hollywood you're the main

00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,700
protagonists here we're highly highly

00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:16,560
we'd would be able to extradite

00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,839
copyright infringing fringes serial

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,720
copyright infringers persons that are

00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:25,320
deemed to be suspicious or trial in

00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,240
America the our precedents in the United

00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,210
Kingdom where users have been flown over

00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,089
the Atlantic to face trial for various

00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:34,950
abuses online another piece of

00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:36,570
legislation which people need to look at

00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,510
is the copyright amendment amendment

00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:43,940
bill which restricts permissive

00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:46,260
licensing in particular the GNU GPL and

00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:50,130
Creative Commons which are permissive

00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:52,349
licenses problem is that it draws all

00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,180
information and all everything to do

00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:59,460
with with data and computers and

00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:04,050
technology and the copyright laws and

00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:05,760
creative defaults where we everything

00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:08,760
that is produced is deemed to have been

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,040
produced in terms of the board so

00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,520
there's no way out yeah and and you if

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:18,390
you read the bill you're not allowed to

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:20,700
sign a contract that would be a an

00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:22,830
escape out of that system you can't sign

00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,839
a private contract it's pretty much a

00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:26,880
piece of legislation drawn up by

00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:32,160
socialist bureaucrats you wish to

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:35,010
control the private individuals I'm

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,869
gonna hand out some copies of I think I

00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:40,650
might have brought it with me or

00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:43,380
possibly even lift it just just a quick

00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,540
one I wrote a document called the

00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,220
electronic Freedom Charter it's a

00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,780
rewrite of South Africa's Freedom

00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:53,030
Charter which was the basis for the Bill

00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:57,060
of Rights just in a kind of egalitarian

00:44:53,030 --> 00:45:00,060
idealistic adolescence if you will a

00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:01,740
manner that the internet shall govern or

00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,619
computer platforms shall have equal

00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:07,109
rights users users shall share in the

00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:10,890
collective wealth new media shall be

00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:13,410
shared among those who work it all users

00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:15,390
shall be equal before the law all shall

00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,790
enjoy equal digital rights there shall

00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:19,890
be leisure in gaming the doors of

00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,900
learning and culture shall be opened

00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:23,339
we shall be chatrooms computers and

00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,950
comforts there shall be peace and

00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:27,660
friendship and these freezin freedoms we

00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:30,239
will fight for side by side through our

00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:33,920
Reuters and modems until we have won our

00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,720
Liberty each one of those points is

00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,920
there are a couple of sub points in the

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,759
document which is available online and

00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,710
I'm gonna intubate

00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:59,549
so thank you very much for listening to

00:45:43,710 --> 00:46:02,339
me right any questions on that copyright

00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:07,079
assignment bill if somebody in south

00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:10,049
africa takes his work and licenses it

00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:14,579
under Creative Commons so kind of he

00:46:10,049 --> 00:46:17,220
retains copyright but allows a free use

00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:19,950
in any of the Creative Commons cases is

00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:22,349
that covered is that they the the

00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:25,200
default is that even if you release

00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:28,230
something under a permissive license it

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,210
still would be in terms of the copyright

00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:33,239
law which as I've said does not

00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:34,739
recognize permissive licensing it's a

00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,079
crazy piece of legislation that's

00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:38,279
written in a vacuum by people who

00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,509
clearly do not understand what the

00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:44,400
credit Commons or the GPL is all about

00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:46,589
can you clarify what you mean by default

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,799
is there a way to opt out so that you

00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:51,420
can give a bit there is not out that you

00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:54,799
would need a court order or a

00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:59,489
constitutional challenge the the the

00:46:54,799 --> 00:47:03,420
Fiat of the ruling ANC government will

00:46:59,489 --> 00:47:05,309
essentially it would run completely

00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,890
contrary to the principles enshrined in

00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:10,249
our Constitution but essentially the

00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:13,619
these bills create work for attorneys

00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:16,259
that they create an environment in which

00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:18,839
unless you have a large amount of money

00:47:16,259 --> 00:47:21,450
able to procure attorneys it's a way of

00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:27,859
soliciting business for the legal

00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:27,859
profession those answer your question

00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:44,099
so is there a sort of layman summary of

00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,960
this copyright bill I think a lot of

00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:48,269
people would be pretty interesting

00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,309
that's a very good point I don't think

00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:52,579
there is a layperson summary of the

00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:55,710
bullet well I have written about it

00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:58,410
that's a very good way to raise

00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:01,019
consciousness and awareness everyone

00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:02,730
feels anyone feels up to it well if I

00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:04,859
could respond to that before I say what

00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:08,730
I was gonna say the right to know

00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:12,059
campaign r2k towards a day has

00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:14,299
summarized these Bulls from an activist

00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:16,950
point of view all right okay and then

00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:19,529
just to rewind during the talk there

00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:21,619
were two points that David touched on

00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:25,019
which I would like to sort of slightly

00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:28,859
elaborate for people who don't are not

00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:32,309
South African firstly at the time of

00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:36,329
world war ii the the people who were to

00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:39,839
come to power in 1948 including a future

00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:41,880
prime minister were so closely

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:44,759
associated with Nazism that they were

00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:48,180
they were interned in in internment

00:48:44,759 --> 00:48:51,450
camps for the duration of the war and

00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:54,630
some of their supporters who had been to

00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:58,529
Germany at the time of the Olympic Games

00:48:54,630 --> 00:49:00,539
just before the war actually reinforced

00:48:58,529 --> 00:49:04,140
right at the country by submarine and

00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:07,259
things like that and the German well the

00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:09,089
Nazi regime had actually planned what it

00:49:07,259 --> 00:49:10,680
was going to do with the entire world if

00:49:09,089 --> 00:49:13,799
it won the war which it thought it would

00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:17,069
do and their plan for South Africa was

00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:20,069
to hand over to those the Afrikaner

00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:21,900
nationalists who actually won the 48

00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:25,460
election so that's what we were dealing

00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:30,539
on it's interesting point so Michael the

00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:31,920
there are there's evidence and the

00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:35,039
evidence is quite interesting that they

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,390
are cards issued by the National Party

00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:39,329

00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:42,710
apartheid system that same party was a

00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:46,049
an affiliate of the International

Gentile white Gentile movement and the

00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:50,460
cards issued during the 1930s and 40s
