welcome everybody to the second session

00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:07,830
this is JT Bhavna from code for South

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:13,349
Africa talking about flossing for a

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:18,119
healthier society welcome cool so yeah

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,560
I'm JD I'm a software developer for the

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,960
first few years of my career I was

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,250
working mainly in ela so I'm really into

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,900
my distributed systems so I haven't

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,820
really done any telecoms but like people

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,710
say or on developers are a certain way

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:37,710
so I started off working on a massive

00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,360
Erlang monolith at Swedish payment

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,340
provider called Klara and there's

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,850
nothing like sort of doing something the

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:48,809
wrong way to learn how not to do it and

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,309
then I worked on some small service

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,960
oriented architecture kind of stuff and

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:56,670
I was fun but it sounds in Europe for

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,140
the last 15 years but I moved back to

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,180
South Africa a few months ago because

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,840
partly captain is awesome as you can see

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,470
and also there's so many really

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,150
fascinating problems to address here so

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,729
it's in it's a really exciting place to

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,000
live and I'll tell you about some of the

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,659
cool things we work on I work at code

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,479
for South Africa we use technology to

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,310
promote informed decision-making for

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,890
positive social change so that's a

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,110
mouthful but basically we try to work

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,909
with journalists and with society in

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,740
general

00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:34,860
NGOs civic society organizations and so

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,159
on and use technology so that they can

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,970
help people take charge of their nation

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,159
and solve their own problems so we're

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:50,460
not really a technology band-aid every

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:55,409
problems we try to find we try to find

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,090
some fun people working on a problem and

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,920
see where technology can make them more

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,340
effective and that's kind of where we

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,649
stand so we don't really use it for

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:10,470
healthy gums it's it's mainly for

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:12,540
society we basic code bridge so code

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,530
bridge is a community it's a workspace

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,240
and an incubator

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,210
it's literally office space under a

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,520
bridge but it's also more than that it's

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,130
we try to build a sort of Technology

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,780
community especially Civic technology in

00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,190
South Africa and anywhere where people

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,560
want to come together and work on this

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,640
stuff there are other organizations

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,920
similar to this so we code for South

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,800
Africa this code for Africa

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:40,680
there's also hack slash hackers that are

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,270
organizations doing this and yeah so

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,280
wherever you are there's probably

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,400
already a serving technology or

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,989
organization doing something I'm gonna

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,330
show you some of the things we do and

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,810
how we use open source software and free

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:58,380
software to effectively make change and

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:01,530
have impact on our community this

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,709
website is called living wage it allows

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,780
you to well the idea is really to

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,890
inspire people to consider the cost of

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,150
living for their domestic workers and

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,200
think about how much they pay them and

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,420
how that much they ought to be paying

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,019
them so in South Africa it's very common

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:22,100
to have domestic workers that come in

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:25,560
they clean your house they might cook or

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:28,410
take care of your kids and they often

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,780
have to travel very far to get to their

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,290
job and have extortionate transport

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,720
costs and it's a really contentious

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,209
topic in South Africa and this had a

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,830
massive impact we believe at least

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,160
you've got 15,000 views on the first day

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:47,480
in South Africa that's a lot the

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:51,299
newspaper that sort of ran the story and

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:54,720
so link people to this microsite got

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,880
12,000 survey form responses there were

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,890
some there was a lot of comments online

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,739
and a lot of them were quite nasty

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,280
because it's difficult I mean this comes

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,959
from our apartheid Ariat heritage but

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,060
all this is is a client-side web app

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,780
it's a bit of JavaScript but combines

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:17,690
some data from I think it looks at sort

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,799
of the minimum wage it looks at basic

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,320
analysis of sort of what a shopping

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,660
basket can look like and it tries to

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,510
allows you to tweak some of the

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,310
variables or for example

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,880
dependants to do someone have and what

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:35,660
impact does that have on sort of their

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:41,030
the standard of life based on what

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:42,560
you're paying in this site is called NPR

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,630
we really need a better name it stands

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,830
for medicine price registry it takes

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,560
some data that the national government

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:51,020
government releases on medicines and

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,360
prices and it allows you to look up

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,480
generics and alternative brands and all

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,860
the pricing for those medicines so if

00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,750
you'd like to prescribe something you

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,130
can immediately see well actually

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,830
there's a free version so instead of

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:07,720
buying panadol or cuñado you can buy the

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,720
one that costs a fifth of the price and

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,400
again it's extremely simple technology

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,840
it's a django app with a sequel Lite

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,330
database I mean you don't need anything

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,280
more to get this done we didn't

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,930
understand the impact that this was

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,630
making until someone broke it in an

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:27,200
update and then a doctor reached out to

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:29,120
us and said sorry this web so it's gone

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,510
I use this every day for my patients to

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,330
sort of she worked in a in a

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:37,160
impoverished community and she tries to

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,690
prescribe the cheapest medicine that she

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,070
can that will actually solve people's

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,560
problems

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,770
so again a lot of impact for very very

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,100
simple tech this website is called huazi

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,040
map it allows you to show localized

00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,480
census data it's based on a tool called

00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,540
census reporter that was made in the

00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,120
u.s. also to show you their census data

00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,680
and as they were building it they had a

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,470
massive budget but as they were building

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,150
it they just stuck it online sort of

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,140
they they release the source code but

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,000
they didn't really think anyone was

00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,310
using it they weren't trying to make it

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,820
reusable and when when we initially got

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,170
in touch they they said well it's

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,440
probably too difficult and we don't have

00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,870
time to help you but my colleagues sort

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:25,810
of picked it up and started building our

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,810
version using our latest census data and

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,760
they were really surprised that sort of

00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,290
actually there was quite a lot of

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:39,050
activity on this fork so this lets he

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,220
share household for example the number

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,480
of households headed by child

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,420
which is a massive problem in South

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,780
Africa in your area or the different

00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,610
levels of education in an area so I was

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,290
at a hackathon in a Township in

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,590
Kimberley where all the diamonds come

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,360
from a little while ago and I compared

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,340
it also allows you to compare two places

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,020
so I compared the play place where I

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,990
grew up and the place where these people

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,430
are going up and it's shocking it really

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,460
allows you to understand the difference

00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:10,370
in in living standards that people

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:14,000
around you have or people far from you

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:16,150
and you can start understanding kind of

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,940
people's backgrounds a little bit more

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:23,390
this is a simple django app with parish

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,640
database it reuses the the map it API

00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,200
and the Google API so you can just throw

00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,810
in any kind of place name and you'll try

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,390
and figure out what you mean or just use

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,669
your current location and it also allows

00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,790
some facilities so you can easily if you

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:40,280
want to build a localized app you can

00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:46,610
you can use an API release buy this or

00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:49,210
you can embed little snippets so the

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,740
next site is actually DQ's website and

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,230
we didn't initially work with them this

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,690
is a project we did with sort of

00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:59,360
ourselves but with some other news

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:03,680
agencies in South Africa it's called the

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,120
tax clock so we we wanted to make the

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,560
national budget a little bit more

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,060
personal for people because I mean the

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,979
budgets are so boring especially at the

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,240
national level well is this to me mean

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:16,160
to me defense spending or whatever and

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,450
how this works basically we provide news

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,330
organizations with a snippet of HTML

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:23,479
that inserts in JavaScript that then

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,460
puts in our part of the site so they

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,260
would write their article and just stick

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,360
in a little text look so you can see a

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,000
bit more of the text log here so someone

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,530
would enter their salary and based on

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,820
that it figures out what tax plans are

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:39,530
falling and then tell you okay this is

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,830
the current time of day so if it's a

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:46,970
workday we'd say well right now you're

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:48,760
working for like education and you can

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,440
immediately see your case of of my

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,050
eight-hour work day I spend eight

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,410
minutes on national debt 12 minutes on

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,550
basic

00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:01,399
education maybe you're willing to work a

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:05,120
little bit more so that people get

00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,620
educated in the country or maybe you

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,449
think that sort of the national debt

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,790
isn't my problem why am i spending eight

00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:16,459
minutes doing that I'd rather spend more

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:18,189
time just working for myself so I don't

00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:21,290
know how many of you do web development

00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:25,459
it's quite removed from kernel hacking

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:27,019
but once you try to insert something in

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:28,279
someone else's website especially when

00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:29,959
it's responsive and especially when

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,399
they're size this responsive all of

00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,480
these things need to resize and jiggle

00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,949
and stuff we and the sort of safest way

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,930
to insert something into their website

00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:41,420
is to use an iframe but iframes are

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,879
quite static in the sizing so we use a

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,160
library called pimp pym that was

00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:50,420
released by NPR the National Public

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,189
Radio in the US and all it does is it

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,589
figures out how big is the parent window

00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:56,990
how big is the child window and it

00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:58,519
resizes and there are some functions you

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,579
can call so if you're resizing things

00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,009
they can resize again so if you flip

00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:07,069
your phone then everything can adjust

00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:09,199
and if you interact with our thing then

00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:11,509
the parent window can adjust it's a

00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:13,100
simple library that does one job really

00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:16,339
well and it becomes that an

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,009
infrastructure for basically all of this

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:23,029
work we do so we will we provide a lot

00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:26,089
of embed codes for interactive ways of

00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:31,579
presenting data in news organizations in

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:33,740
South Africa and abroad and so just

00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:35,269
making this available is so fantastic

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,790
it's really helped us to do something

00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:40,279
but what was especially fun with this

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,259
one is we hadn't made the embed code and

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,089
documentation available yet

00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:46,819
Jiki picked us up for one of the other

00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:51,170
news organizations I think because sorry

00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:55,699
oh I think it's a like lifestyle

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:57,650
magazine yeah ah gentlemen's quarterly

00:10:55,699 --> 00:11:00,860
yeah

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:02,180
and like we were so happy that they

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,460
found it and it picked it up and

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,040
basically everything we do is usually on

00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,720
our public on our github even when it's

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,980
with news and you might imagine news

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,240
people are kind of scared they've got a

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,120
lead and they don't wanna really stuff

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,400
our job is to release information to

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,900
help people make informed decisions we

00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,110
were so excited that they picked us up

00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:23,420
by themselves they're helping us to help

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,550
people be informed but I mean this this

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,300
it's a sort of it's a lifestyle magazine

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:33,830
but it applies to people once you make

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:36,830
something personal you can sort of

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:39,290
capture their attention and hopefully

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:42,320
have a positive impact or at least self

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,120
discussion so this isn't actually

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,920
website this is a poster and I've got

00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,070
another example of this poster in the

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,880
hallway if you want to chat up

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:56,480
afterwards or this afternoon this is a

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,580
this project is basically people in

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,250
local communities going to clinics and

00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,630
social grant offices and local

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,400
government offices and asking people

00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,750
using those facilities what their

00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,190
experience was so they're trying to

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,070
understand are men having the same

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:13,790
experiences women are people being asked

00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:15,920
for bribes and the reason we make

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,250
posters is a lot of these people are too

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,750
poor to have access to Internet they

00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,130
they even a lot of them don't of high

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,480
schools so you have to be careful how

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,800
you present the data you can't check

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,330
percentage because a lot of people just

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,820
don't understand percentage they haven't

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,860
had sort of exposure to that so you have

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:36,290
to show the raw numbers instead of

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:37,880
percentage and very graphical but people

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,070
can print this out and they take this to

00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,630
meetings with these facilities and they

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,600
can say okay these are the problems we

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:46,700
found now in the first year the

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,770
organization sort of coordinating this

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,240
use a proprietary survey tool and it was

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,280
kind of awkward to get the data out to

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,920
analyze it in the second year we joined

00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,190
the project and they started using open

00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,320
data kit or idk collect which is a an

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,060
app that allows you to sort of collect

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,640
survey data you've download a form you

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,020
collect the survey data once you have

00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,540
internet connection you can upload the

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,970
survey results you can upload it to any

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,580
server following the protocol so

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,010
like they were using form hub for my

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,850
business available anymore so the next

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:24,740
people using OD cover toolbox another

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:27,770
one but it's so fantastic that this data

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,990
collection tool is available so we were

00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,670
able to run our own when former boss was

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:35,420
running slow

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:37,940
and so to gather this data and do this

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,920
analysis and produce these we just

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,220
downloaded the CSV s from from this data

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,860
transformed it put it into spreadsheets

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:49,880
that usable scripting to generate the

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:51,620
the SVG's only now are we making a sort

00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,020
of in the next phase of project are we

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:59,390
making the general platform for

00:13:54,020 --> 00:14:01,010
gathering community based surveys we've

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,410
been making this impact in these

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,660
communities with very very basic tech

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,960
just helping people download the

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:13,400
spreadsheet teaching them how to use

00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:15,830
pivot tables and presenting the data in

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,830
a way that is useful for for the people

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,850
actually using the data so now we're in

00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,710
the next phase and we're beginning to

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,840
make a platform where anyone can go and

00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:27,770
run a survey in their community and try

00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,950
and have similar impact and my my work

00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,840
on this was basically to download the

00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,190
data and automatically visualize it

00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,230
immediately so as soon as the survey is

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,140
available you can start seeing results

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:43,280
online which is exciting but that isn't

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:45,020
where the core thing is happening it

00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,420
might sound like a joke but

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:50,840
cinéma my boss always is a most

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:54,710
pragmatic thing we're doing is providing

00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,210
xlx port a lot of our clients don't

00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,250
really know what analyses they want to

00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,250
do with the data they collect or with

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:04,430
the data that they have so if we build

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,950
them a platform where they can do this

00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,560
analysis from the start it's not really

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,240
going to help them there's a nice quote

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,310
from Joel Spolsky where he says at least

00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,260
once every three months there's a start

00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,310
up the reinvents pivot tables like you

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,320
don't want to be writing this thing

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,230
again people have done it it's very

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,160
powerful we even have it in Libre Office

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:29,430
or whatever your

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:31,830
favorite four keys of that so you really

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:36,090
have to figure out what technology you

00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:38,850
actually have to write this isn't a site

00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:42,180
we've made this is Goblet UK it's the

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,490
British government sort of making your

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:47,370
website where there's pretty much the

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,870
face of government for anyone whenever

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,370
they want to interact with government if

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,020
I want to understand how to do something

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:57,000
if they want to pay certain things they

00:15:54,020 --> 00:16:00,330
they go by this website they have a

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,110
design principle both services not

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,790
websites the actual thing that you want

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,350
to get done like it's easy to say we

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,020
need a website sure it would probably do

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:13,800
but what service does that need to

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:19,470
provide focusing on that helps you get a

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:21,030
lot done a lot more done and what's cool

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,210
about them is a lot of what they're

00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:26,430
making is also available on github why I

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,350
mean maybe I was gonna do something

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,540
maybe another government can replicate

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,920
this or maybe someone can just provide

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,480
pull requests to improve their

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,540
government's website which is very

00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,880
powerful and this is maybe beginning to

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,770
happen in South Africa as well so we

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,320
were part of a pilot program in South

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,650
Africa to develop a national open data

00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:50,970
portal and right now we're working on a

00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:53,670
project with National Treasury to to

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:57,600
release municipal financial data so

00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:59,490
local government financial data publicly

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,200
that it's already been released for a

00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,560
long time but it wasn't spreadsheets and

00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,300
on the rubbish website we're making an

00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,240
API so that anyone can build an app that

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:12,270
works on it and we're making a sort of

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,790
an example app that shows the financial

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,760
health of any municipality any local

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,500
government in the country so that people

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,290
who don't understand finances can

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,230
actually understand the stuff it's

00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:28,020
extremely exciting it's also a bit scary

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,050
because maybe this is going to make some

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:34,470
people look bad maybe it's the truth

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:36,190
coming out it's very difficult to

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,340
interpret these things

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,260
without bias a large part of this is

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,330
providing education alongside releasing

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,240
this information but releasing data and

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,549
then providing the tools to analyze it

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,059
but the right tools this is very

00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:53,740
important so I'd like you to get

00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,760
involved and I think a lot of you

00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,380
already are

00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,620
if you're writing software and releasing

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,660
it that is fantastic

00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,400
open source software helps us to make

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,140
social change I spend a lot of this talk

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:10,179
saying how little software we're using

00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,730
and that's kind of the point the

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:15,940
building blocks are out there you don't

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:18,340
need to reinvent the wheel figure out

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,940
how to get big things done with basic

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,760
tools

00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:24,940
it's the UNIX way or build those tools

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,620
if they're not available we save a lot

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,090
of time so that when we actually do

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,070
write software when we're gluing these

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:36,570
things together it's actually making

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:40,390
real impact and it's worth it so yeah

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:43,110
and just get started even small things

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:45,940
can help we're two full-time developers

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:49,480
generally and we have impact on a lot of

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,190
sites find local data and play with it

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,169
there's a really exciting thing that

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,690
happens I don't know if you've done that

00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:58,600
but like this finance data that we're

00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,220
working right now is it sounds so boring

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,200
and when we opened it the first it was

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,210
so boring and then you sort of start

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,760
associating it with other things and you

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:10,419
start really realizing wait a minute

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,340
maybe I can find this there maybe I can

00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:13,840
understand this question they're like

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,000
questions start popping up of what you

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,040
can maybe do with this data it's really

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,080
exciting and it's really strange that it

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,900
sort of develops as you looking at the

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,809
data Thank You sabbatical we're also

00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,160
hiring you you don't have to leave your

00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:30,250
job completely you can come to us for

00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,540
six months wherever you are and I was in

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,210
Sweden for the last five years and I

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:37,090
didn't find a hack sakis organisation so

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,770
I started thinking maybe they don't need

00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,570
it I mean they're doing okay and then

00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,340
they the the whole sort of refugee

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,710
crisis happened and they started

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,380
realizing wow we're not so open to

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,040
people coming to our country they didn't

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,480
realize that before

00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,060
so maybe there's some work to be done

00:19:50,480 --> 00:20:06,290
there to help people make informed

00:19:53,060 --> 00:20:08,300
decisions yeah that's it thanks a lot we

00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:14,660
have time for a few quick questions I

00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:16,430
think so yeah hello probably the first

00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,010
question is some of the services that

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:23,570
you are mentioning of quite powerful and

00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:26,270
very like necessary services right one

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,860
quick question is that as you stated

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,970
like the the one with the medicine

00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:33,830
clearly probably you didn't foresee

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,770
probably the need to have an impact

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,510
analysis do you have like that in your

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,580
horizons like you have some impact

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:43,520
analysis or some of the services because

00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,950
I'm thinking if you can have you know

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,740
that then you can obviously motivate

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,140
some of the services that you how'd you

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,260
learn today hmm I think that's a very

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,600
good question so especially and that

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:59,540
comes in especially when we're funded so

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:05,620
we're generally funded 50/50 between

00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:07,670
contract work and and from grants and

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,770
obviously for the grants that we have we

00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:12,530
have to explain and show the impact

00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,700
we're making usually that doesn't fall

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,290
under us because we partner with

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:22,430
organizations already doing these things

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:24,890
so they did that impact analysis so we

00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:27,560
tend not to sort of do this kind of

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,940
thing but a lot of the time associated

00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,740
with the project there's a researcher is

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,660
sort of analyzing the actually impact

00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,660
and that that's actually one project I

00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,610
did with an organization they wanted to

00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,920
do impact analysis of the stories that

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:44,030
they write for they're called health

00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:47,450
either they write medical news and they

00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:49,490
try to that they all they really need to

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,850
do is gather data about what they're

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:56,140
doing and what impact that's having but

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,140
we didn't do that ourselves generally

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,000
any other questions

00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:09,539
any questions from IRC did anybody check

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:12,010
um maybe not okay then

00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:19,390
well if let's thank this week again

00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:19,390
