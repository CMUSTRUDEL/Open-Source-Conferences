I did last year a buff on D become for

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,139
common which is a really a deviant

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,630
native tool actually I got an for me

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,790
extremely good response it was my first

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,310
puff to attend at the DEP calm while I

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,699
was giving it so I really decided to do

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,289
that again this year I hope I will be

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,060
talking a lot less than last year

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:30,869
because I want feedback from all of you

00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:34,320
but quickly so what is this talk or this

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:37,050
both about I quickly go through the

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,219
important changes that I implemented

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:45,750
last year Indy becomes a common I hope

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:48,930
that you can share some of the use cases

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:53,969
that you see have problems great stories

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:57,090
bad stories I'd like to know and I hope

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:01,079
that we can have a look at the database

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,850
policy actually my the the the the

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,960
person that created the become for

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:09,740
common Sheen Theory created their policy

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,799
on packages that need a database already

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,570
well twelve years ago or so and I'm

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,689
wondering if we want to do anything with

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,000
that document which is still draft we

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,220
could take it up and actually I think

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,240
the question was raised last year if

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:30,240
actually packages should be requiring DB

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,130
called common in policy in general so

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,570
I'd like to have an opinion on that if I

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,820
should try to take that further so the

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,180
last changes since last year actually

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,720
the I find the most important one it

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,250
took a while to get my head around to

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,439
properly implement it is the

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,380
introduction of multiple of other

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,110
packages that are called after the

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,229
database type that are using and the

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,600
idea is that packages that only need or

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:05,460
only support the MySQL database for

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,710
instance murrieta be database only need

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,989
to depend on that package and that will

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,540
pull in the clients because in the old

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,970
case DB come for comment

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:20,050
that you as a package maintainer needed

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,880
to depend or recommend the client

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,920
yourself which you would not need in

00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,070
your packets but you would only need it

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,650
for D become for common now the second

00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,920
great thing I think that a lot of people

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:35,110
liked about introducing this is that you

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,430
as an system administrator now also have

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:42,310
a way out of by installing DB config no

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,260
thanks to say I don't want help

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,420
already by installing the package you

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,420
don't get any deep depth of questions

00:02:50,310 --> 00:03:08,980
yes oh sorry justic be green okay if you

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,620
use DB config no tanks does this apply

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,930
to all packages on the system that you

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,060
Stevie convey common so there's no way

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,370
of saying yes if it can't be common no

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,100
thanks for a but because become no

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,350
thanks for PU yes if you want to opt out

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,350
on some packages but not on all you will

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:29,590
have to go through a via configuration

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:32,410
but you can proceed that since last year

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,390
so that was in last year's talk that you

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:38,380
could proceed he become for common which

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:41,260
was not working very well before so this

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,500
is global the other one you can still

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,500
proceed

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:54,790
another great improvement I think for

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,540
for most people so not the advanced user

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,850
but most average users is that the local

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:06,010
setups local host setups have improved

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:09,310
so for Postgres my scroll and McGrady P

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,620
as well as SQL light so actually all the

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,470
databases that are supported by DB come

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,590
for common on the normal local host you

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,720
don't actually need a password so FD

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,870
becomes common can figure out that you

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,150
don't need it it will not ask because

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,000
lots of bugs were coming in that the

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,800
administrator

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,050
just typed in the wrong password because

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:35,930
he never set the password for root for

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:38,960
instance that the questions that I get

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,630
asked have been improved especially in

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,690
the error handling area so to make it

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,820
more clear what the in case of an error

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,070
what the operator or the administrator

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,250
should expect from the package such that

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:56,960
you get a better choice all error

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:59,030
handling you can either say ignore all

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,340
errors it will just continue and the

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:05,650
package has installed successfully while

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:09,290
obviously it hasn't but for dpkg

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:11,060
it just ignores all errors you can say

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,970
abort and then actually the installation

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,610
failed which is I think the default if

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,220
you're running in an interactive mode

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,919
and it's ignore is the default if you

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,770
run in non interactive mode such that

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,070
you can just continue the other two

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,510
options are to try again maybe in the

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,900
background you fix something and

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:36,950
retrying is just the right option or the

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,120
ignore try again but ask also all the

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,430
questions again and then you actually

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,150
get additional questions and that's made

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:46,010
more clear in the template further

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,700
improvements of course are still welcome

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:55,610
but I also review this with the English

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:57,560
an international lion team so it should

00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:03,350
be proper in this already but we can

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:07,880
always improve the beacon for common is

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:13,940
written in shell and actually the error

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:17,330
handling was relying on set - e which

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,970
means that if an error occurs the the

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,190
script just bills out it turns out that

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,530
there's quite some packages that use the

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:29,030
statement if the become v go and then

00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:33,169
some error handling off its own that

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:34,760
kills off set - e so the whole error

00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:37,250
handling in DB come for comment was

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,910
broken if you did this in your package

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:43,620
so i've requested all packages that

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:47,830
do this to not do it anymore but I also

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:50,320
fixed the beacon for comment to not fail

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:54,690
on that it just meant that in I think 40

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:59,350
60 100 lines I had to add or return

00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:06,220
dollar question mark which is extremely

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:08,050
stupid but she'll apparently some

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,090
backups can be huge and people don't

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,070
like them if they're upgrading so you

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:17,650
should now get a question if you want to

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:23,650
do that and I extended the outer package

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:28,510
test quite a bit I test now both low

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:32,170
level with all shells that support what

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:35,650
I need to support theater policy and as

00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:38,340
well as I install upgrades remove purge

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,690
things all that of all the example

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,030
packages that are included in me become

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,370
common actually this already caught real

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,620
bugs in the MySQL upload in Ubuntu

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,710
causing them to fix the bug instead of

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:56,950
releasing so that was great for auto

00:07:50,710 --> 00:08:02,080
testing so now I really like to hear

00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:12,490
your ideas user stories or whatever

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:15,790
I made a where is it among go be in that

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,430
comm 16 both be become for common if

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:22,900
people like to put stuff there or take

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:25,720
notes so what are things that are going

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:29,680
well are not going well need to be

00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:33,510
improved as already showed on the slide

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,940
I have well basically two ideas of

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:41,260
question of do we need to support more

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:43,060
databases you already said that last

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,390
year I have not come around to actually

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:49,500
implement it but MongoDB is on my list

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,500
but are there more

00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:11,040
okay so for supporting the DB it doesn't

00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,410
have to handle the creation backups and

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,350
so on when we care the most about is

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,720
that it at least asked me two questions

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,220
so that I can reuse the

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,670
internationalized templates of the comp

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,340
from DB config for example MongoDB if

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:31,130
you just ask what the hostname is that

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:35,640
and that's not for me how do you mean

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:38,040
more it doesn't matter so much to me if

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,340
you want little creation and deletion

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,320
and lifecycle management of a database

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:48,660
what really is important is to be able

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:52,200
to just ask the questions but if I would

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,420
do that everything that's that's even

00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,910
better but it's more urgent to have the

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,610
ability to ask the questions which is

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:02,790
very easy to do right it's just well

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,140
then the point is that a big part of DB

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,120
come for common doesn't know what

00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,100
database it's asking the question for at

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,530
that moment so I would need to check

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,090
that in the case of MongoDB it's not

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,510
doing all kind of logic that it normally

00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,510
does

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:44,880
so any other databases that are on

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:47,040
request if not but if you encounter one

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,170
just please let me know I mean the bug

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,850
tracker is open also for wishlist item

00:10:49,170 --> 00:11:03,390
and I do handle them although I'm about

00:10:53,850 --> 00:11:06,210
to get their really bossy go and I

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,940
already talked so we I know his requests

00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,190
for the handling of the was that DSN

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,860
thing you know look into the script that

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:18,420
you already have on that front try if I

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:21,420
can you're welcome okay so one of the

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:26,790
features I already used myself is that

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:31,560
my package needs to read and write GSN

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:34,350
so it has login password host into that

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,770
fancy can you just type of DSN example

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:41,070
so that everybody knows what it is and

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:46,320
then so I wrote the passer in shell

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:50,070
script for myself and I'm sure others

00:11:46,320 --> 00:12:00,060
would use it so it'd be nice if we could

00:11:50,070 --> 00:12:04,970
just share it together oh you can search

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,970
from DBC and there's something

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,210
again above above

00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:31,119
no it's not at the end of the file you

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,119
want me to search for it

00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:59,690
okay so other other points success

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:04,280
stories that people have with using it

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:07,430
or walking into issues with the handling

00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,650
that it actually does are your users

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,750
satisfied with how BB conflicts common

00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,750
handles stuff

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:28,179
yeah so that little bit of shell scripts

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:32,139
I include them on my packages that needs

00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:34,809
to be configured on and it passes the

00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:40,269
configuration file ask the question

00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:44,079
using the config common passes the GSN

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:49,809
if it already exists then populates the

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:56,470
DBC variables like their pass DB name

00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:58,839
type okay and then called the BC go so

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:03,910
that that function is to be called in in

00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:06,879
the pre inst and then the equivalent for

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:09,009
the questions that would will write the

00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:13,660
file so it does the opposite way it

00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:18,939
takes the DBC information from DB config

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:21,459
current variables and creates GSN out of

00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:25,509
it so in that SQL connection so you see

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:27,069
postgrads DB user one of the questions

00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:33,399
that I actually have with respect to

00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:35,619
this I actually at a box washing party

00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:39,369
already a couple of years ago filed a

00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:42,429
bug against DEP comm where I where we

00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:44,290
thought it was a we created the bug

00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:48,149
together where we thought that it would

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:51,279
be great if actually we have a

00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:53,439
configuration file parser that we could

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,860
just call and that not everybody needs

00:14:53,439 --> 00:15:01,059
to create his own configuration reading

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:04,809
script Segoe uses any files but of

00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:07,149
course there are more that's actually

00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:10,089
the DB comfort common has the problem

00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:12,790
that actually to circumvent the VB

00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:15,519
napkin is not a registry issue

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,589
it creates an additional configuration

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:21,490
file where at stores in its own format

00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:23,319
the variables that it uses while it also

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:27,689
writes a configuration file for your

00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:30,999
package with the variables in your

00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:32,740
requested format which makes sense for

00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:35,490
your package and make sense for D

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,170
becomes common but in a way we created

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:41,290
although it's an configuration file it

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:46,180
is still a sort of registry in that

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:48,040
sense which I think I will not get

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,889
around but I think it would be helpful

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,569
to actually allow a package way easier

00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:54,089
to provide you become for common with

00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:56,560
all the variables out of its own

00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,240
configuration files so that not

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,970
everybody has to rewrite that own

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,829
functionality I think it should not be

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,170
in DB come for common but if there's no

00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:08,769
other place then I think we could be

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:12,610
added to DB Comic Con so what's your

00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:16,269
idea of pinyon on that I mean obviously

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:28,930
you're trying to get your any foul

00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:31,120
reader out of that who here uses DB

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:36,850
config command in their packages can you

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:39,509
resend just one - okay would you use

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,509
these kind of functions

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:56,589
maybe so I don't know so so how do you

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:58,630
handle that right now do you know so so

00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:00,250
actually I don't even remember because

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,720
it's like more than a year ago that I

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:07,839
entered this and it basically was quite

00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:14,260
a breeze specific database information

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:17,290
for my package yes but I'm not sure no

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,449
but but still I saw the point in DB

00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:22,240
confer calmness you need a configuration

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:23,949
file in your format you need one and we

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,370
we keep a shadow one if the

00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:30,400
administrator changes actually one of

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:32,320
the two that's all that UCF will will

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,110
notice it and will warn the

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,190
administrator what's going on but it's

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:42,659
still in that sense a little bit weird

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,659
because you may change your

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,840
configuration file then you start up B

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,450
become for common and it will show you

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,460
not the value that is in your cover

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,710
raishin father but the one that you had

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,679
during installation if you don't

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:59,950
properly tell they become from it's a

00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:03,070
big if this happens it's a bug in that

00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:06,159
package yes but I think it it would be

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,049
helpful and actually I think that I also

00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:12,340
need to check if all parameters are

00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:14,260
parcel possible so I think I wonder it

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,409
did you ever check that you can change

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:20,169
all the variables in your configuration

00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:23,380
file and see that D becomes common is

00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:28,049
actually using your variable if you have

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,049
you check that it does all of them

00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:36,720
believe it my script works now if you

00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:39,600
put something that has absolutely no

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,690
logic I'm not sure what's the result

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,029
yeah so III I know by looking at the

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,190
documentation at least of DB confer

00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:50,889
common that it says you can pass these

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,700
variables from DB confer common to D

00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:56,950
becomes common at this moment in time so

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,200
I'm wondering if there's variables that

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,899
are stored in your local configuration

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,370
that could actually get lost this so I

00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:08,370
think I actually should check that very

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,370
carefully

00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:26,600
okay so if there's no other remarks on

00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:29,030
that front so create a link here so in

00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:36,050
DB come for Coleman there's a policy

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:42,080
file let me check if I can open it that

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:45,260
says well a lot of input basically what

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,630
this document describes is what Sheen

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,370
Finlay tried to implement of course in

00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,320
DB come for Coleman so at the end it

00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:54,530
mentions well V becomes common is a

00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:58,000
framework to actually do this but it

00:19:54,530 --> 00:20:00,620
says this tells things about what

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,420
administrator can expect from packages

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:10,840
that handle databases as such as that on

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:16,400
how to do the prompting where to install

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:18,440
the database about how to handle failure

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:25,010
to do stuff that you should allow

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:29,030
upgrading and removal and I wonder if

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:30,770
this is useful to pull this further than

00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,810
where it is now I mean it's a document

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,280
in DB come for common it has the status

00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,870
of Draft

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:43,210
should I try or we try to get this into

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:47,150
TV in policy or appendix to that

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,850
document or I think it would be useful

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:53,470
I'm not a great policy writer so I'm

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,470
glad that the document is there but

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,680
should I just take it up with the policy

00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,710
team and see what what happens if I do

00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:07,760
that and what do people think should I

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:10,460
ask for a packages should use V becomes

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,280
a common if there's a database involved

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,780
such that we try to make sure that all

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,700
the bugs end up in the safe place

00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:22,540
instead of all over the place and people

00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:27,580
inventing wheels okay

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:31,570
I'll try that man okay what I would love

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:34,000
to see happening would be a kind of

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:37,360
debhelper thing that would make things

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,690
fully automated I don't know where also

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:46,929
I can't contribute that so select you

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:51,510
know the free end the toad config the

00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:53,679
dot postings the in the post RM files

00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,900
you have to write a bunch of things

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,679
there with UCF it's not obvious what to

00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,419
do and it'd be super cool if users would

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,210
have nothing to write there and it was

00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:10,929
fully automated from maintainer to me

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:12,429
yeah and you just do a th - - with DB

00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,990
config command and it would do two

00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:18,720
things

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:25,500
all right that's a good idea

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,500
we're also about one minute in time so

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:41,590
something like that with space always

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:43,510
equal all right yeah so the yeah I can

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:48,940
think of if there are smart defaults

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:57,130
that could be chosen there yep I can

00:22:48,940 --> 00:23:01,419
think about that okay oh and we'll just

00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:03,370
leave it here always send bugs wishlist

00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:05,500
items if you have them and find them

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:11,880
yeah that makes it easier to communicate

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:15,929
on them and keep track of that okay

00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,929
thank you for your attention

00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,400
