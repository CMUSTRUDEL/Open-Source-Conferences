00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,600
okay welcome

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,049
I attended Def Con for the first time

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,770
last year and two very important

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,240
valuable members of our community to me

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,369
gave this talk so I'm going to do my

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,689
best to repeat it to you because it was

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,729
very useful for me this session is for

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,990
people who are new to Def Con as well as

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,180
for people who have been today

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,909
comfortable and you're all welcome to

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,240
participate whether you are active or

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,070
not actively participating whether you

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,320
want to get involved too are involved in

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,659
Debian or do not want to get involved in

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,390
Debian or debconf you are still welcome

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,799
to participate you are welcome to

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,840
participate in any way that you would

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,040
like to whether that's actively or

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,890
quietly what we call lurking whatever

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,170
you do be true to yourself so this is

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,909
true both for this session and for Deb

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,220
conference I think they being in general

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,970
the most important thing you can ask

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,930
front-desk

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,640
anything Rhonda the most important thing

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,009
about Debian and Deb Kampf is our

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,770
diversity statement do you want to tell

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:09,209
us about it yes that was a quite lengthy

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,960
discussion there was at one point the

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:15,390
diversity statement proposed

00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,800
because to make it clear that Debian

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:22,970
welcomes contribution from everyone and

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:28,310
regardless of how they identify how they

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:31,950
are perceived and to make it clear that

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:35,630
that that the Debian project welcomes

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,670
contribution from everyone regardless of

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:42,390
yeah different types of discrimination

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:45,210
and they're going on or whatever and as

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,440
long as people are working together in a

00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,980
constructive way

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:54,270
we will come everyone in the project and

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,640
the same holds true for that country and

00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,590
a lot of the work of Debian is technical

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,220
which I thought would be a huge barrier

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,480
for me

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,160
I am technical but in a completely

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,500
different way I don't understand

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,420
computers and that's okay because a lot

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,780
of the contributions is also as we can

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,540
see creativity graphic design

00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:15,290
translating all those sorts of things

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:18,209
and users are also very important

00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:25,110
can I ask how many of you are attending

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:28,739
Def Con for the first time all the hard

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:32,550
work worth it how many of you in the

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:36,720
station has been to dev craft before ok

00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:39,390
thank you also for Vika ok the next type

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,980
I forgot to say we have 5 points in the

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,200
store the first one we just did the

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,500
welcome the second one is a diversity

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,820
statement very important then I'm going

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,150
to take you through the tips and tricks

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,190
to make them come good for you which

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:59,630
will include Polito cider is high

00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:01,650
voltage yeah no ok so I think the most

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,150
important thing although it's really

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,070
difficult sometimes because there's so

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,170
much information is the DEFCON 4 wiki

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,880
it's very well curated there's a lot of

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,850
information on there and it's open to

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,370
everyone to participate and to add into

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,980
edit just like a wiki 'as the dev craft

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,350
discuss mailing list is also very

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,930
important for information and

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,190
discussions and a lot of things that are

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,430
happening in addition to the technical

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,130
part of

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,919
happens on the mailing list as well as

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,229
IRC so you need to talk to people if you

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,850
want to go sightseeing or drive around

00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:36,850
because sometimes those things don't

00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,759
make it on to the official channel the

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:43,449
IRC who knows who doesn't know what IRC

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,610
is we all know I receive excellent I

00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:48,160
didn't know about obviously last year I

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:54,720
stack dev conf and then there's also a

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:57,820
bot which is misbehaving today but the

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,780
scary part is supposed to announce when

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:07,090
fog starts when the foot times are so we

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:09,430
don't miss out the important part and it

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:14,070
also announces when people arrive so

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:17,530
that you know when your peers are here

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:21,729
there's also the possibility to opt out

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:24,039
from from that because not everyone

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:31,000
feels comfortable with being announced

00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:35,710
in a IC session that they are here yeah

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,169
and it hopefully should also send to

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,340
Twitter when the talks start so that

00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:44,889
people were remotely attending or

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,530
watching through the video stream also

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:50,889
aware which sessions are going on and

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,830
where they can participate in Washington

00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:55,690
and the IRC is a lovely channel that

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,509
really makes this a global conference in

00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,770
the truest sense of the word okay from

00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,740
the globe I want to do some very

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,539
location specific things I'm introducing

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:10,120
you to our money do you remember the

00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:12,099
right that's yes is it five eleven

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,159
better we'll see we'll see how it works

00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:17,860
this is pollito who has gone away again

00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:20,250
did someone have him yet no he makes a

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,250
horrible noise this is our chicken and

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,900
when he arrived he did a site tour so

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,940
that you don't have to but you're

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,740
welcome to follow in his footsteps this

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,710
document is only

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:36,639
that's not a nice one this document is

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:39,750
on the internet somewhere but I will

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,819
quickly go through it with you

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:46,720
polito's English is not that good he

00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:49,840
also trusts no one but he likes cake

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,289
time thankfully this is our view from

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,380
the city at night this is on map so we

00:06:53,289 --> 00:07:01,000
are the mealtimes and the residences are

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:03,909
here we are over here now I think so

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,319
that yeah sure okay

00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:10,090

so as long as you're in this region

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,870

00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:20,580

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,080
one and then there's also the supercar

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,790
Club which definitely has the best views

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,710
if you get up early enough you can see

00:07:51,790 --> 00:08:02,040

00:07:53,710 --> 00:08:04,930

there's also hot clubs around the

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,470
conference areas we're just struggling

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,230
with venue access so we might update

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,660
those venues and there is internet in

00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:18,400
all of these places as well as at the

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:20,410
Tennis Club pub above right quiet

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,150
archive work looks like this very good

00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:27,220
hiding space okay

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,140
happy feet a clap it's very warming

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,050
temperature but please don't switch too

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,000
much heat is on on the same plug point

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:39,460
but you should be here most of Simon

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,289
it's nice and warm here now okay jammie

00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,860
Hall I think we've moved up and down

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:50,920
enough times today of those all nice and

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:53,410
fit now okay to get to ATMs and drawing

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,880
money is right next to the Jamie steps

00:08:53,410 --> 00:09:00,250
there's also is super fly here Raul

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,110
there's a machine to buy a time it

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,530
doesn't work really well to buy a time

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,120
from the banks on campus so don't try to

00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,830
do that come talk to us we've got a

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:19,780
machine that is developed in South

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:23,320
Africa for this problem two attempts in

00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:25,330
there which have a different charge that

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,310
you have a different fee that you have

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,280
to pay if you withdraw money from there

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:36,960
I think the one on the left side is that

00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:39,400
keep the one for foreign people right

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,600
is it the envy that it was the night

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,040
bank one it takes cards okay

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,160
pollito does not trust banks neither do

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,160
we

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,190
the three ATMs is a bit lower down and

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,680
there's also on that side is the Leslie

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:05,280
social so if I could show you if we're

00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,320
here then the ATMs over there and

00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,820
there's also over here the Leslie social

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,680
which is also where there's cafeterias

00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,970
and things so I encourage you to walk

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,230
around a little bit both of those are

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,730
really close and they fail you on the

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,160
same level you don't need to do up and

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,020
down too much and go and explore and on

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,790
the weekends it is a little bit quiet in

00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,050
the week there is a lot of activity

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,360
because there are three searched are

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,300
from students yet so it's still fun to

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,650
do it's safe during the day it's safe

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,900
during night but don't carry your

helpful people dummy shuttle services

00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:00,330
you can use the blue buses that are on

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,160
campus you need to show them this if

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,110
they ask you and there's also an

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,630
emergency phone number I think Anya if

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,720
there is a problem and you're not around

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,540

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,930
front desk has an emergency number it

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,640
can take a some aces so if you suck

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,890
anyway just keep your badge with you at

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:24,870

work on Graham do you want to say

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:40,950
something about the blue lab it's

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,540
upstairs and neat swipe card access so

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,330
you need to find someone with a card

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:50,070
okay but they're all computers there and

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:55,350
if you need extra anything that's a nice

00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:57,510
one I'm not sure if we're using Snape

00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,160
but most South African flags look both

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,650
like the European plugs and this

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,300
three-point South African flag and we do

00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,950
sell adaptive plugs but I think they ran

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,420

00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,540
nice way to meet people

00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:38,430
okay I think we're almost finished the

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,020
club pub I think is opening this evening

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,570
again it has a fireplace

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:46,050
it's very nice that's where we spend

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:49,589
deep camp and then the last one here has

00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:52,200
a couple of useful information on which

00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:54,940
I think I'll leave there for the moment

00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,030
okay the next thing person-to-person

00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,890
interaction there's a lot of people here

00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,140
from all over the world and our

00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:05,470
languages are very different some of us

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,690
really struggle with English don't think

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,090
about it too much the important thing

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,580
here is about sharing your ideas keep it

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:16,000
simple but say it the point is

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:18,310
communication not being perfect I know I

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,310
speak very fast if I speak to you please

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,230
tell me to slow down don't be afraid of

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,490
that

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,410
having said that if I am if you're a

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,900
native English speaker tried to speak

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:33,280
slowly try to avoid jargon or slang

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,650
terms check in with that other person do

00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,270
you understand do I need to say this in

00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:40,690
another way say it in another way just

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:42,280
in case moderate your assertiveness the

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,840
other person needs to deal with your

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,830
language barrier as well as your

00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,120
personality please bear that in mind

00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,470
give some time for the other person to

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,200
understand and reply and you're I'm

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,240
quoting Enrico and he was hilarious when

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,710
you have finished saying something wait

00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,880
for three seconds before you say

00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:02,890
something else this leaves a pause for

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,010
the other person to finish parsing the

00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:09,750
audio that was buffered in streaming

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:13,840
both the syntax stream navigate compile

00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:16,720
optimize understand figure out to reply

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,500
and say it and sometimes we need

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,750
multiple pauses don't be afraid to give

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,940
constructive feedback don't be afraid to

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:29,470
give compliments if you need attention

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,570
volunteer it's the best way to make

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,670
friends it's the best way to learn you

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,950
can do only an hour a half an hour a day

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:39,070
you meet interesting people sometimes

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:42,190
you get an extra t-shirt even get out of

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,860
your comfort zone and then take the time

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:47,140
to recover it's okay to feel tired with

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:51,700
a lot of exposure it's okay to take time

00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:53,560
out when you see a bunch of people

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,140
standing in a group try to include

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,370
others in a common conversation

00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,260
sometimes it's really hard there's

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,180
language barriers there's interest

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:04,570
groups but it's the only way you learn

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,980
magical things about the other person do

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,730
you want to tell us about the games

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:12,760
that's playing played active well

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:17,340
there's one game which is quite in

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:19,870
famous it's called Mao you see people

00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,360
running sitting around the table with

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:26,070
cards in between them and rarely

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:29,800
speaking a word they probably play Bao

00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:32,850
don't be afraid it might be difficult at

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:37,800
the first time but it gets a dick tip

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,800
and you know yeah

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:48,340
there's also games like assassin which i

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:50,080
think is Maddox favorites right no well

00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:54,010
it was but all the people he played with

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,780
on date now there's we're wolf

00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,230
there's board games it's physical games

00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,490
like the tennis there's also key signing

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,200
you've seen an email about the key

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,280
signing party it's a running thing it

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,500
happens all the time

00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,010
I think Jana is giving it talked about

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,710
it at some stage guna that's the reason

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:14,440
wanna numbers and a batch so the people

00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:16,780
with numbers on the batches are part of

00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,210
the key signing list but even if you

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:22,120
don't have a number and have your key

00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:25,800
fingerprints on a slip of paper it can

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,480
still approach the people to exchange

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,080
okay shall we spend a couple of minutes

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,080
on questions

00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,440
[Music]

00:16:40,230 --> 00:17:00,309
it's not about the price Winchester

00:16:43,949 --> 00:17:03,670
issues several from the network as a

00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:11,020
meal or go to the front desk it will

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:13,470
help you okay there was another question

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,470
in the back

00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:31,710
these rumors you're talking about the

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,350
pub with a beer

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,730
there's rumors and I know this this

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,429
morning there was a private function

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,159
named so it when that happens then it

00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:44,320
isn't open to other people on Sundays

00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:45,940
it's open only if there was enough

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,649
people on Saturday and there's enough

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,110
beers so I think you just need to check

00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:54,340
on our see the whole time if it's open

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:57,009
the Tennis Club pub also has B own also

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,980
has some snacks and we can arrange when

00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:05,110
that is open it's just a hello up your

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:06,789
walk no we talked to someone who opens

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,980
it but they're a smaller operation than

00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:14,129
the pub so they're easier to just open

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:16,149
interest they only have bottle beer

00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:19,389
because I don't know about the numbers

00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:21,639
so we couldn't know is it open every

00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:28,360
conference okay so the UCT about is open

00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:29,860
tonight from 7:00 p.m. okay six ish but

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,690
you'll definitely see people on IRC

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,690
talking about it gets a lot of attention

00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:48,610
any other questions so the question is

00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:52,330
is the UCT club the same as the Tennis

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:54,490
Club no there's a Sports Center down

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,139
hill which is close to where you come in

00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,539
if you you probably passed this big

00:18:56,139 --> 00:19:01,090
concrete looking building as you come

00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:02,860
into campus that is the you CT Club the

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,639
Tennis Club is very much uphill with

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,730
tennis courts

00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:10,119
okay so there you city campus on the

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:13,690
bottom right of the man so if you go out

00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:19,370
from hula Oh down the stairs and to the

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:28,460
left you get directly I can try

00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:28,460
[Music]

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,460
navigating in Reverse is really weird

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,000
[Music]

00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:09,150
[Laughter]

00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,150
[Applause]

I was supposed to be AMPAS Bach that was

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,340

one dog's name is res as in res prison

00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:10,450

[Music]

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,560
but if you are called please let someone

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:41,960

do you have any comments or remarks just

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:53,030
if we want to go into Cape Town or

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,770
explore the city a lot at all and just

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,650
because someone keeps asking about cult

00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,930
I'm Canadian if you have fingers or cold

00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,030
toes put on a hat it's not a joke it's

00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:04,820
seriously the best thing to do dry

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,170
clothes and a hat definitely and there's

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,640
probably been about a hundred people

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,490
who's been here for a week now and

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,260
they've organized most of themselves so

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,740
as a local I'm probably a worse person

00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:17,780
to ask because I don't know what

00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:21,470
challenges you have I know that if you

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:24,710
keep going down here if you walk down

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,480
here down then main road is here and

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:33,080
there's a lot of shops that sells

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:34,880
beanies there's also the UCT shop and

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,250
they also sell beanies that's branded

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,710
with University of Cape Town yeah but

00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:50,210
also if we get stuck please ask we do

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:51,560
shopping trips a lot so I just wanted to

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,570
add because the question was a bit I

00:22:51,560 --> 00:23:01,000
guess about like how do we explore Cape

00:22:53,570 --> 00:23:06,620
Town when when yeah yeah yeah well okay

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,230
well cape town cape town is is not kind

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:12,230
of a completely safe City but the places

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:15,140
where you run around even at night are

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,610
safe if you're in a group the the thing

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,590
is there are people who just you know

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,800
want money of you there's no social

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:23,540
security system in in this country so

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,840
there are just very poor people and

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,830
sometimes they are very desperate so I

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,500
would advise not to run around

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,750
at night unless you know the places

00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,179
where you go if you're in a group of

00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:39,630
three people or more there is no real

00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:42,630
risk the thing is if you want to go into

00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:45,929
Cape Town and there's three options one

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:49,049
option is you call it a burr or a taxi

00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:52,649
uber works very well here and you

00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:54,630
usually go down to V&A waterfront so V&A

00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:56,700
like Victoria and Albert and then

00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:59,010
Waterfront that's kind of the touristy

00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,740
location where there's overpriced

00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:03,720
restaurants and lots of funny sail shop

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,460
but there's also a big mall and so

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,760
anything you would want to have you find

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,169
there and there's also great pictures

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,669
opportunity towards the table man so

00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:13,409
everybody goes down there and takes

00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:15,840
pictures of the table man they're even

00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:18,389
kind of steel frames set up there so

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,460
people towards know where to stand to

00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:24,149
take pictures for money it's all very

00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:26,100
very well laid out so that's kind of you

00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:27,720
know the the easy thing to do and

00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,820
probably something you should be doing

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,940
it's one of the options for the day trip

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,710
on on Wednesday if you just you know if

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,570
that's enough for you and you just want

00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,429
to explore the city of it but you can

00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,690
easily do this in the evening as well or

00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:41,070
just you know during the day when

00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,340
there's two sessions on which you done

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,899
are not that interested in also for the

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,720
do you say something about the day trips

00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:50,700
I could and there were there was

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,860
questions about the day trips we would

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,080
love you to sign up so that we know what

00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,779
to organise for you the one option

00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,230
apparently has a big waiting list don't

00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:03,059
be afraid about that because we can

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,669
probably organise more buses but we'll

00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:07,440
confirm so just put your names down in

00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:10,110
terms of interest don't worry about that

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,309
it's full or not full and the options

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,649
are on the wiki I don't think I should

00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:16,470
if you don't know what to choose go to

00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:19,080
Cape Point it's the best one

00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,640
I wanted to add like this about three

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,799
things you may want to do it here the

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,450
one thing is the waterfront take the

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,280
pictures you need a nice day right if

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,750
you don't see the Taylor mountain you

00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,690
don't need to go down there because it's

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:32,820
only overpriced malls then the second

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,320
thing is you may want to go to the table

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,820
mountain or even up the table mountain

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,110
to take the picture the other way around

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,750
there's one of the options on the day

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:41,760
trip and you can go with Bernal she will

00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,400
actually walk up there and if you are

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,830
then still in the mood she will also

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,020
walk down from there again but you could

00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:52,200
take the cable car down be mindful with

00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,789
you know a more normal physical

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:59,580
condition may just want to take the

00:25:53,789 --> 00:26:02,190
cable car it up or down a thousand

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,740
meters steep uphill and another thousand

00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:08,520
down like Heights you know you don't may

00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:10,440
not want to do this and then there's

00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,190
like for the day trip there's one option

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,929
which the locals fear recommend which is

00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:18,630
basically go down to Kay point which is

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:21,240
this most southwestern point here in

00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,530
South Africa and on the way there's a

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,450
thing called Boulder Beach where

00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:26,820
sometimes a few penguins hang out and

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:30,210
you can go and watch them so that's kind

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:33,809
of a nice South African experience in a

00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:36,320
day so like these three are possibly you

00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:38,520
know the most you can fit in a week

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,070
touristy while still attending the

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,960
conference and you know doing what you

00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:52,640
really want to do here which is interact

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:52,640
with the Debian community if you want

00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:01,299
on the street district their couple of

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,399
Fringe districts there's the green

00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:07,269
points I'm just tricked stretch which is

00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:10,720
very pink Nate the tree

00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:13,389
district which is free students academic

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,539
kind of people and Woodstock

00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:20,110
which is a little more on the rough side

00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:21,730
but there's some very interesting spaces

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,710
there so you want to live on that

00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:29,620
slightly more dangerous side of Cape

00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:31,029
Town yeah so I think with David he

00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:42,850
sounds like he knows all the interesting

00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:44,740
spots okay let's move on you can still

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,690
ask questions throughout um I thought

00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,149
it'd be well from last year it'll be

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,620
great if some of the past tape comforts

00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:53,049
could share these stories maybe a

00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,970
highlight from there comes there's so

00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:57,429
many stories and if some of the new

00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,919
people today become tell us a bit about

00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:08,250
how you got here and why are you here

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:11,980
any volunteers Brenda what's your paper

00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:18,460
thanks what do you remember my my first

00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:22,179
step count was 2005 in Helsinki kind of

00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:25,809
nervous because I didn't know many

00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:28,960
people by personally pectin I mean a

00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:32,110
leaf in Austria and drove to some

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,510
conferences in Germany and know put some

00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:40,389
people from there but not so many Debian

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:44,500
people it was kind of interesting

00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:49,330
yeah because so many people that you

00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:53,889
interacted before just fruit IRC chat

00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:56,649
mail whatever you know you know know

00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:59,919
personally and then you get a completely

00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:02,230
different feeling for the people just by

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,990
sitting together for Germany

00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:08,350
two minutes talking with them and the

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:11,620
next email I received from them you read

00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:15,100
it completely different back then it was

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:18,490
sort of still a lot of flame wars going

00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:22,570
on on mailing lists jelly that has sort

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:25,780
of ceased but one of the things that I

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:28,480
took for me from Helsinki's because her

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:33,330
stinky was Finland Finland lots of

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,950
saunas I said after that it's hard to

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:45,470
engage in a flame war with someone you

00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:48,619
have to sauna is poor

00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,619
[Music]

00:29:52,989 --> 00:30:00,799
yeah so last year was my first tap Kampf

00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:03,080
I knew in advance that debconf would be

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,879
here this year and I thought well I'll

00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,279
go to Heidelberg it's close by for me

00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:11,659
it's from Holland and next year I'll

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:14,269
skip and see what happens but I think

00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:16,009
already during last step Kampf I decided

00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:18,529
that I really wanted to come here

00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:20,659
because it gave me so much energy while

00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:23,570
I was there meeting all these people

00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:27,200
working on stuff together may be hard

00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:29,119
stuff busy stuff other stuff that people

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,210
just ask you hey can you help and that

00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,029
was we need to get things done and then

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:37,070
we just did it together so that was a

00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:41,090
great for energy for me how many bugs

00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,739
that you guys squashed last year I don't

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:58,190
know I squashed a lot of other people's

00:30:42,739 --> 00:31:04,609
bugs okay hi my name is Cherie this is

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:06,980
my first Def Con F I came because

00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:09,019
basically I had heard about that corner

00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,779
for quite some time and we have been

00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:22,789
doing some mini Def Con s in India so we

00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:25,669
hope to and we do not know okay

00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:27,950
but we are looking for a newbie I mean

00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:29,929
sir we have some people from India here

00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:33,169
so we are looking for that new energy

00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:35,960
who can be with us and can help organize

00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:38,480
and I'm also looking forward to Def Con

00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,499
of organizers to give me their wisdom so

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,509
I can use some of that maybe to make a

00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:48,970
formal bed or two whatever I need to

00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:48,970
note and also speak with my

00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:14,910
[Music]

00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:17,580
I come from a place where average 35

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:21,450
degree centigrade and since 15 so I've

00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:23,640
been repeating the same dialogue so but

00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:26,070
I think I've warmed up to the climate

00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,040
right now and other than that the

00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:32,580
community here is amazing and I've met a

00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:35,870
lot of new people the climate like the

00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:38,700
lot of the things that are actually

00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:40,170
practices around family air so when you

00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,180
are in when you're at home I've been

00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:44,100
taught rigorously by my parents

00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:47,690
do not look at strangers don't even look

00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,690
at them don't talk to them nothing

00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:55,890
long conversation so that's it's a very

00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,800
different experience and it's really fun

00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:02,370
so this is just I'm just I've been here

00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,310
only for barely 24 us so hopefully by

00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:07,410
the end of 9 more days I can have a lot

00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,000
of wisdom to take back and it's a very

00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,920
great experience and made our three

00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,670
friends thank you thank you for the

00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:17,549
wonderful

00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:17,549
[Applause]

00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:29,520
hello everybody on video I guess I'm

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,890
sort of the antithesis of a new person

00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:35,820
since I started in the Debian project in

00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:37,770
the fall of 1994 and I've been to every

00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:41,070
Def Con since debconf

00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:43,590
- the thing that I wanted to add that I

00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:45,900
hadn't heard spoken about yet today

00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,250
which came up in the similar session

00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,680
last year and I thought was really

00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:52,380
important is if this is your first time

00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,810
in a dev conf and you meet somebody or

00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,370
you hear somebody giving a talk or in a

00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,230
session that you think is really

00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:00,470
interesting and you'd like to meet them

00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:03,600
or talk to them don't be shy about it

00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:06,000
the reason that I come to DEFCON is to

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,280
have the opportunity to meet new people

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,100
that are enthusiastic about this project

00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,670
that I have now put well over 20 years

00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:17,070
of my life towards 20 wow that's a lot I

00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:21,470
don't want to think it makes me feel old

00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:23,640
sometimes but please don't be shy about

00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:25,650
finding people that whose names you

00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,910
recognise or that have said something

00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,500
that you think is interesting in a

00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:33,380
session or whatever and come talk to us

00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,380
it's the whole reason we're here thanks

00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:43,310
okay one last thing we're gonna do a

00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:45,530
little exercise now if you don't want to

00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:48,740
participate you don't have to but it is

00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:51,410
a lot of fun I want you each to have a

00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:53,420
pen and a paper there's some pens and

00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:56,150
papers in the front that we could

00:34:53,420 --> 00:35:13,570
distribute who can volunteer helping

00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:13,570
distribute these thank you

00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,770
you can tear the paper in half and share

00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:33,330
with other people if you can that's as

00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:33,330
much paper as I could organize a joke

00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,619
[Music]

00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,149
[Music]

00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,469
[Music]

00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:13,920
okay does everyone have a paper once you

00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,500
have your piece of paper could you fold

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:22,910
it so that your four sections you know

00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:25,170
where this is going how much do you know

00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:31,920
that's okay that's fine

00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:34,970
don't go smaller than that you optimize

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,970
things very low-energy

00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:43,980
okay once you have these four pieces

00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:49,200
please take in your first quadrant

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:51,920
what brings you to deep comm spend like

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,869
one sentence to sentence not a lot

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,599
secondly and your second sector what do

00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:59,279
you do in Debian or computer-related if

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,559
you don't do anything in Debian it and

00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:05,220
in your third section what would you

00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:11,510
like to do is in Debian I'll give you

00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:11,510
five minutes we'll say thank you

00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:47,810
getting you a little bit out of your

00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:51,320
comfort zone but not too much what we're

00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:52,010
going to do now is ask you to meet up

00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,230
with someone

00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:59,420
take your paper with you and one partner

00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:02,450
asks the person the question what brings

00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,160
you to their pop the other partner can

00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:05,500
read your answer because you know how

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,120
often you stand there and you're like

00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,640
you know answer and then when you stand

00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:12,050
there you just like I don't know so now

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,900
you do you have your cheat sheet

00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:17,810
okay so let's do that and then we say

00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:20,390
swap you tell the other person what the

00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:22,430
answers are and I promise you it's going

00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:25,190
to descend into chaos and that is okay

00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:27,530
and then we're just going to do that

00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,790
once or twice or three times and then

00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,380
it's finished and you can take your

00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:32,930
paper with you and you can use it as a

00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,900
tool to make friends throughout day so

00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:39,200
that's all good okay I think do you want

00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:42,290
to stand up or do you want to stand up

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,330
let's stand up let me move it

00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:48,460
[Music]

00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,460
