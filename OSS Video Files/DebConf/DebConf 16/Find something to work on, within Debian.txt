hi everyone I guess it's three so I

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:09,290
guess I should say something so hi I'm

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,700
not going to be projecting anything the

00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:15,150
thanks you all for coming golly I didn't

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,930
expect so many people so please have a

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:22,699
seat in my survey my thinking of this

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,070
event was that we have 45 minutes or so

00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,630
where people where I want people who

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,550
want something new to work on in the

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,859
project to talk just a little bit about

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,010
themselves and what they are interested

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,630
in in the project and I'll explain that

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,309
in a second so there will be they're

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,110
like I'll call them mentees

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,370
introductions and my thinking is that

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,309
once the people who want something new

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,530
to work on have spoken the people other

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,510
people who have projects that those

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,550
people could work on should just go talk

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,320
to them and yeah say hi and talk about

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,370
some some aspect of your project that

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,040
they would find interesting so to do

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,549
sort of a rehearsal of this if I was one

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,770
of the mentees and I said hi my name is

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,090
Ashish one thing I know about Debian is

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,400
that it's an all free software operating

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,450
system one thing I like about Debian is

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,549
that I've heard there's so many ways to

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,369
contribute one thing I want to learn

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,850
more about is I want to have more

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,360
experience running web services if that

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,250
was what the mentee had said then I with

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,380
my mentor hat on as a different person

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,320
might have been taking you know Oh

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,759
Ashish that person Wow good luck good

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,740
that person I should talk to them about

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,750
working on mentors ah Debbie not met

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,909
since I want help from somebody

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,200
maintaining that web service and so then

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,259
I would go talk to them after the intros

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,750
happened is that like clear which this

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,670
does mean that the mentors the people

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,710
who have tasks to offer people should

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,939
really be taking notes because if you're

00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,979
not then you're going to forget by the

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,579
end of this which person it was who

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:05,579
seemed like they can help you so

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,799
hopefully you all believe that okay

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,149
great

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,149
yeah can I get a quick show of

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:13,879
thing la-dee-da okay great Wow yeah that

00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:15,200
only works okay yeah yeah okay so with

00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,599
that distinction in mind where there's

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,980
people who want new things to work on

00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:23,180
and there's people who have tasks to

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,400
offer or people or yeah just has to

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,930
offer I'll call those mentees and

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,760
mentors can I get a show of hands for

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,470
who here is a mentee who wants something

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,120
new to work on in the project but raise

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,709
your hand for longer good okay and can I

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,120
have all my mentee people will switch to

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:45,079
one side of the room which one has the

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:46,670
most I guess sorry yeah that's true

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:49,519
but then there'll be more okay right so

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,260
input the pencil yeah there's more

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,239
precision so all the mentee people

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,530
please come to this side and I know I'm

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,879
disrupting you thank you for

00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:01,930
participating in my game yeah so I'll

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,930
wait for you all to move

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,140
yeah yeah this is about finding minions

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:20,470
and my vision of success for this ball

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,870
will be people on this side of the room

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,970
will find something interesting to work

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,950
on and then go work on it and so like if

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,480
half an hour into this talk everyone has

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,500
left the room that could be a success

00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,000
it's not just that you hated it so great

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,110
and then is it true that everyone here

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,460
except for the people who are still

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,310
moving then raise your hand if you're

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,220
somebody who wants to fight who has a

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,020
task to offer to other people okay so

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,800
you all should go to that side I don't

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,300
know how you didn't figure that out

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,490
before but I'm glad that we've had this

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,930
talk

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,780
I'm also shocked at the relative balance

00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,980
of these two groups this is amazing wall

00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,610
people are moving how many people here

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:03,780
are first-time debconf attendees

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,460
first-time attendees to Def Con okay

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:11,440
cool yeah okay a lot of people that's

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:13,750
lovely and I also wasn't able to attend

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,220
the like the intro sessions over the

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,650
weekend so if any of this repeats with

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:22,060
that you should let me know I guess or

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:24,940
complain or something great okay

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,830
yeah so what I'm the way imaginary

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:32,110
structuring this is that people here

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:36,310
will say I should write this on the

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:42,580
chalkboard cuz I'm not gonna project is

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:43,930
there chalk okay great thanks yeah maybe

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,030
we won't need it we'll see but you'll

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,830
you'll state your name and then one

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,450
thing I want to keep this as brief as

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,280
useful so one thing you know about

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,560
Debian one thing you like about Debian

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,600
and one thing that you want to learn

00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,950
more about and that the thing you want

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,180
to learn more about doesn't have to be a

00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,280
thing within Debian you want to learn

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,620
more about it could be another valid

00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,560
answer to this is one thing I know about

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,210
the Debian project is that it has a lot

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,400
of Perl code one thing I like about

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:12,610
Debian is that we're switching to system

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:18,160
D and then one thing I want to learn

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:20,229
more about is how to how to give good

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,820
how to communicate well to lots of

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:24,890
people at once and so

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,060
and obviously some systemd maintainer

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,830
will be like great you're gonna give a

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,510
talk about system D to some local Linux

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,180
users group and so the kinds of things

00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,440
you might end up doing I hope I hope for

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,460
this is easy advice for you all the

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,370
kinds of things that you recommend

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,930
people do should be related to all three

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,340
of the questions what they know about

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,830
Debian what they like about it and what

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,240
they want to learn more about in general

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:48,250
in their lives or specifically within

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:57,440
Debian uh wow I'm shocked this is great

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:59,650
so sorry oh yeah yeah yeah I'm working

00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,650
on it

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:47,600
whoa I guess this is illegible because

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:49,190
of that board yeah and I should also say

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,650
this is modeled after an activity that

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,840
my friend Shawn lip did at an open hatch

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,930
event about two years ago so if he ever

00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,850
watches this video thanks to Shawn so

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:04,040
yeah and maybe you all like pause after

00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:06,710
the first all pause after people in box

00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:12,500
of four in case the ravenous pass task

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:14,990
offerors want to absorb you yeah okay so

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,340
why don't you start and tell us for your

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,510

Debian has many many architectures I

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,199
like about Debian that we have many

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:17,730
policies and most of the stuff is

00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:21,410
described so I can go to documentation I

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:24,920
would like to improve a little bit

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:28,529
coordination of my packaging with other

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:31,019
packages which which are using my

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:33,829
packages or which my packages are using

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:36,120
I'll curiosity what packages are those a

00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:39,420
particularly PI could apply opens here

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,850
so they both contain with Python with

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:48,209
Nvidia drivers and other drivers with

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:50,790
OpenGL with OpenGL providers so I really

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:52,860
think it's getting a little bit more

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:56,040
complicated especially us now there are

00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,329
changes in hard detectors cool thanks

00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:02,610
thanks hi my name is Dominic I'm from

00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:05,850
Poland and I've been using Debian for

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:07,649
like I don't know since 1990s but I'm

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,510
just a user and one thing you know about

00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,420
Debian oh they have to answer those

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,889
questions yes I know the experiment work

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,069
I have to do it I know that it's free

00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:19,139
and open and see I like it I like yeah I

00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,899
like the idea I like the community and

00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,490
everything I mean yeah I'm all supposing

00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,160
you want to get better at I wanna I want

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,800
to learn about package maintaining and

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,279
stuff you know like packaging cool yeah

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,639
at first to see how it works and so

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,199
anything any anything great yeah I said

00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,630
I promised I would pause after the first

00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:41,550
four people in case the ravenous task

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:47,670
offers have anyone that they wanted to

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:49,050
latch on to so if I'm lucky the four of

00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,370
you will disappear from the room quickly

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,269
and if not then we'll figure you out but

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,510
with the end of everyone else

00:12:52,269 --> 00:13:04,720
I didn't want to go grab anyone sure

00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:06,720
yeah but okay first also had been to the

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,790
zoom a bit earlier before before lunch

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:14,110
we are we have a very large back shoe

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:16,240
and in the policy for the policy package

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,950
which really means Zack some more

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,010
difficult tasks there are some tasks as

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,660
just messes her to implement the

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,089
policies of commutation we already have

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,950
that means we have mostly Petrus which

00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:29,709
are pollute but somehow needs to be

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,420
fiddled into the get to the so that

00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:33,070
there's a lot of hence we have to a lot

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,640
of a dubious documentation which making

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:38,800
sure things and really as I should and

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,589
appropriate English understanding or

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,000
language skills are helpful but as you

00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:44,890
can hear I'm not a native speaker so

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,579
it's not Ashley the cover to be a native

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:51,670
speaker but of course yeah so about that

00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:53,829
so if someone that of you who like to

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,399
pick up on one of these tasks that would

00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:58,110
be great

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,110
Dominic do you want to go disappear

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,459
atomic yeah you must be native speaker

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,660
in some language is what I said it from

00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:06,339
Dominic what suppose it's not

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,779
necessarily I have a question which is

00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:10,420
do you want to just go hang out with him

00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:12,579
in a high clan no really if it's about

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,500
translating now because also slating

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:17,829
it's a speaking I'm speaking about step

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,950
in policy package so far as a package or

00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:23,260
as a let's it's a document which says if

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,940
you have a pepper impact if it would

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,339
have been packaged watch does your

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,829
package need to follow so we have

00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:31,899
something like 3040 pack reports saying

00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:33,670
this should be changes a policy which

00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:35,350
are a belief but just don't implement it

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,089
so we have patches which needs to be

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,339
applied sometimes the checked at some

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:41,649
art other needs to be added people need

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:43,810
to be asked so it's really some officer

00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:45,640
let's say we're basic piece of Debian

00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,130
infrastructure part is a text file which

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,810
is a basic thing so if you have been in

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,930
session before about this new maintain

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,940
opposes all of this up of policy watches

00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,750
ask there comes on the policy package so

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,370
I'm speaking about polishing is that one

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:04,499
yeah yeah might have a look at that yeah

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:06,759
so Sigma s has translates hands

00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:07,989
you can just disappear into a hack lab

00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:10,660
if you want yeah like that would be a

00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:11,019
success for me yeah you can stay - it's

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,699
fine

00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:14,920
okay so then I'll go I'll keep iterating

00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:18,790
over the group so yeah tell me your name

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,079
Kate Stewart okay the one thing I know

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,199
about Debian it's the upstream for a bun

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,459
to where I've been active for a while

00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,379
what do I like about Debian is the

00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:30,369
actual social structures associated with

00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:31,899
it and the meritocracy aspect of it and

00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:34,059
what do I learn more about is the

00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:36,790
packaging and the policies and doing

00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:38,920
some packaging for some packet some

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,540
projects that care about cool I'd of

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,879
curiosity what projects did was it that

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,799
you care about uh pathology got

00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,199
abandoned in 2012 which program

00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:50,679
pathology got a bit of a salt and I'd

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,299
like to see if we can get it in and cool

00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:55,139
so looking for mentoring that way -

00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:55,139
great

00:15:55,529 --> 00:16:02,009
okay I'm David yawns oh I like about

00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:09,939
Debian that it worked pretty but nice

00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:10,989
before systemd or so and one thing you

00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:12,249
know about Debian one thing you like

00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:13,749
about Debian we all swapped the order

00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:18,910
yeah and one thing you want to learn

00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:23,019
more about I know that it's probably

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:26,980
most free operating system around and I

00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:28,059
want to learn packaging cool and is

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,809
there anything in particular that

00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:39,699
motivates you to learn packaging not yet

00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:41,499
okay great if you want I guess it has my

00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:43,839
name is DJ Audrey answers I'm fairly new

00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:47,610
to this I know that Debian is a linear

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,110
distribution I like about it that it's

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:53,290
for the community community driven and

00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,029
also many people contributes that to

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,730
make it work

00:16:55,029 --> 00:17:00,610
what I want to learn will have been

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:03,850
using Debian for quite a few years now

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,159
I'm more interested in how it all comes

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,480
together what I had as a package get

00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:10,389
into the leap

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,980
right to stage where the kids install

00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:16,329
them sure there's one thing I saw

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,769
already there's this website

00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:23,529
contributors ODB not org contributors DB

00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:25,329
not or NASA organize old I gathered all

00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:28,720
the information that all contributors

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:31,029
all over all the teams so that's

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,970
something I might be interested in cool

00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:42,429
but I am open to her - more than that

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:51,730
great hello I am Guido Trotter the every

00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:54,460
way very overt coming up okay I I don't

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,940
think she's interested to be honest no

00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,570
one thing you know about Debian yes I

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:04,690
know how Debian is great in

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:06,970
infrastructures and the servers and for

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:11,350
visualization and things like that I

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:13,990
like how it's a great community that

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:18,610
also evolves technologically very much

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:21,340
over time and I want to improve and

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:24,429
learn on the new sides like system D

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,409
containers and like things that I

00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:28,929
haven't had a chance to touch or have a

00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:32,559
orbit I have had a chance to touch a bit

00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:35,380
and maybe I can contribute to cool

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,000
thanks thank you by the way if you all

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:44,380
are taking notes of people you really

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:47,100
should be ok hi my name is Carl I know

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:50,380
about Debian but it's one of the older

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,659
destroys out there I also like how it's

00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,230
open both the code and the people and

00:18:52,659 --> 00:19:00,210
it's really great community and I'd like

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:04,710
to learn about packaging more multimedia

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,710
software packages maintaining them

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,700
great can I ask what you mean by

00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,830
multimedia packages like some examples

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,880
or something um so things like rock

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:24,540
comics TV switch more the video

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:34,640
switching or did audio editing that kind

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:37,320
of thing cool thanks I'm sick yellow and

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:44,850
the one thing I know about Debian is

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:50,370
that is that it it can run on many

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:53,900
architectures and personally I I use it

00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:59,340
a lot on maybe the ARM architecture

00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:03,270
which i think is cool and the one thing

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:05,790
I like about Debian is among others the

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:10,080
stability general stability of the

00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:15,230
system and then what I would like to

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:20,210
learn I would also like to learn some

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:25,140
packaging and maybe developing as well

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:30,110
and second to become a developer go in

00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:35,460
the distant future great yeah if you are

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:44,010
I can repeat it if you want or hear the

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:46,620
mic yeah because I'm sure a lot of us

00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:49,250
here to packaging but we have like

00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,250
specialties

00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:57,170
I do have an I'd like to like does cut

00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,730
your own edge approach works well so if

00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,559
you guys have anything that you don't

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,620
like in Debian I think it's the best way

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,780
to get started so maybe you don't like

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,340
some padded packaging it has already

00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,230
done or you think there's software

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,880
missing this is where I would usually

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:17,600
start if I was a new contributor at

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:19,280
least tell me are there any specific

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,980
areas you like packaging or you're

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,780
interested in packaging we're just

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,179
learning about it as a like I guess what

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,620
motivates you to learn about it is it

00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:28,700
just the coolness of Debian or is it

00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,710
that there's some software you really

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:35,510
want in Debian or it's hard to say

00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,910
there's any software that maybe I don't

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,710
like what I miss in Debian because it

00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,080
does have quite a lot of software and

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,520
I've already mentioned that it's quite

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,210
stable for my needs

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:52,040
I've I can't even think what needs to be

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,550
improved that's how good it is okay

00:21:52,040 --> 00:22:00,679
great

00:21:52,550 --> 00:22:05,620
so yeah I probably I've used one package

00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:08,809
that I had to compile for for one of

00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:11,390
machines I use it on and it looked like

00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:14,630
it was becoming an orphaned package but

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:19,340
I think the developer is here the core

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:24,800
that was oh no no no maybe not to us obd

00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:27,550
gps logger so maybe maybe something

00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,550
similar to that

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,770
yeah you can grab the mic

00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:45,250
my name is Andrew and I'm a Debian

00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:47,960
developer and I came here because uh

00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:51,470
basically since so I gave up if I've

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:54,380
done last year I don't have any specific

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:58,210
bit of debian to work on just maintain a

00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:00,590
bunch of packages all the program yeah

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,720
things I like about they've been six and

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:06,220
the no boat they've been ok things no

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,220
well they've been that I'm part of it

00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:14,960
was it about Debian is how some people

00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:21,799
already mentioned the social structure

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:23,360
around it so basically the people think

00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:27,200
one thing you want to learn more about

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,919
or improve in yourself for yeah so as I

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,630
mentioned in the beginning I'd like to

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,350
not only maintain some packages mostly I

00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:38,809
use on but participate somehow in the

00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:42,580
development of dev in itself not only I

00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:44,600
mean I'd like to just join some team but

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,789
you know because lots of things happen

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,950
in there being sort of in background

00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:51,919
like people working teams already and

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:58,280
you don't often know what exactly is

00:23:51,919 --> 00:24:01,280
going on so it's not easy to join those

00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,530
teams basically even if maybe I maybe

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,480
I've got some experience or knowledge

00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:10,090
sufficient to work on some things but I

00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:13,090
just it's not that visible enough cool

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,090
thanks

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:22,410
hello my name is Keerthana so one thing

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,440
I know about Debian is that it's very

00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:27,030
robust and that's very good to use one

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,770
thing I like about Debian is the

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:31,980
community because everybody is great

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:33,660
very supportive and one thing I'd like

00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,670
to learn I think it's not one thing

00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:38,700
because there's a lot for me to learn I

00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:40,500
am very new and I'd like to contribute

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:47,370
and build a package one day that

00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:50,570
hopefully strengthens Debian cool hi I'm

00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:54,240
Nico something I know about Debian who

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:57,030
that one is tough well that it's

00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:01,710
extremely committed to being actual free

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:04,740
software and tree goes much beyond what

00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,020
other people do to enforcer something I

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,540
like about Debian is that I can

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:12,390
basically run it anywhere and expect it

00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:15,540
not to break and like many other distros

00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:17,760
and something I would like to help

00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:22,350
improve his well I would like to help

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:25,830
make stretch has secured a nice safe as

00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:29,270
possible out of the box for users out

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,270
there cool

00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,150
so I'm sure are you from India one thing

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,070
I know about Debian is the vast

00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:45,580
abundance of packages that are available

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:48,309
and that all of them are free software

00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,500
and that is also a thing I like another

00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:53,350
thing which I liked is that I can hop

00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,770
onto IRC Debian - mentals anytime and

00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,929
always find some help there Wow some of

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,730
the things I want to learn our packaging

00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:02,470
I am already working on a few packages

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,840
but I'm just getting started so there's

00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,760
a lot of things I don't know so I'd like

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:16,120
to learn more about packaging in general

00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:19,330
oh thanks I'm jerath a thing I know

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,700
about Debian is that tar lives in /bin

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:26,530
whereas in some other distributions that

00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:30,130
lives in /user but now I know where said

00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:31,960
lives because I've had to fix this what

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:37,270
I like about Debian is pretty much

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:38,559
everything things I want to improve wait

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,909
now you had people where I will not

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,580
accept that answer you had to be more

00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:48,520
specific if you like about Debian one

00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:49,240
thing you could say everything except

00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:56,380
this question

00:26:49,240 --> 00:27:00,059
no but something specific it's a good

00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:02,080
default for pretty much everything I do

00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:04,929
what I'm working on a lot at the moment

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,770
is containers and clusters of containers

00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:11,559
and persistence and all sorts of stuff

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:16,840
that uses tools that have only existed

00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:19,179
for a year or two and I I'm working on

00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:24,390
improving a lot of that stuff and I'd

00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:27,390
like to do some of that work in Debian

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,390
cool

00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:36,159
hello I'm Masood

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:39,600
one thing I know what the Venus the it

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,970
has great committee its which I like and

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:48,279
it's consider but freedom and that

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:52,240
diversity one thing I don't improve

00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:54,850
learn I would like to I haven't decided

00:27:52,240 --> 00:28:00,130
to where to stop each sub project to

00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:05,620
start with I will decide on on a

00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:07,389
sub-project to go deep intervals and is

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:10,840
there something that you want to learn

00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:12,519
you know with you wanna that you want to

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,529
learn which sub project is good for you

00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,169
in Debian but also what you is there

00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:20,409
something you want to learn more about

00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:23,200
in general in computing or in your life

00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:26,649
or some skill you want to be applying or

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:31,649
something like that and even my team

00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:34,659
security team maybe i i i cannot or oh

00:28:31,649 --> 00:28:36,220
yes i like what kind of teams might yeah

00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:37,299
what kind of skills or some teams might

00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,129
be interesting you said mentioned

00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:43,570
security maybe i don't know

00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:47,710
cool thank you yeah you're welcome

00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:50,139
cool so according to my plan i was going

00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,879
to do these intros and then hope that

00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:53,169
you all would just like mingle and talk

00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:55,059
with each other

00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:57,129
because I don't think passing the

00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:58,720
microphone is sustainable because we can

00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:59,909
have lots of one-to-one conversations we

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,809
can't have very many one-to-many

00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:08,009
conversations but yeah so if before we

00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,009
transition I'll take any questions

00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:19,530
everybody apart does not help mingling

00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,419
yeah I know so you'll have to get up and

00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,980
talk that's like when when the

00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,230
transition happens you will abandon your

00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,450
computer lease on this side just move

00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,000
over that side and stand around people

00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,549
won't listen and talk to them

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,559
yeah wouldn't those guys have to say a

00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:37,110
few words about what they have to offer

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,620
yeah possibly but they can tell you one

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,100
on one

00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:43,770
I don't know sure who on this side wants

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,049
to say at most ten words about the thing

00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,640
they think you are interested in helping

00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:49,890
with or thing like a task you're all

00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,600
interested in offering or an aspect of

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:57,600
Debian that they should talk with you

00:29:51,600 --> 00:30:00,210
about I mean a few words is great I

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,880
currently maintain the printing stack in

00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:07,049
Debian I love your name sorry did you

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,490
have Oh Oryx in Debian I also have to

00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:10,620
answer these three silly questions these

00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,500
three questions okay I have two sorry

00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,960
they're good questions I maintain the

00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,580
printing stack in Debian which has the

00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,990
nice feature nowadays to be mostly

00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,750
up-to-date so it's not a lot of

00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:23,250
packaging work but it's something on the

00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:27,030
midterm that I would like to hand over

00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:30,090
to someone else because I've soon had

00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:31,409
enough of that but I want to make a good

00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,490
transition and I will keep maintaining

00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:37,140
it if no one takes it and the other

00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,570
words I want to say about main training

00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,400
packages a lot of yous want to maintain

00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,380
packages and unfortunately they've been

00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,200
already has quite a lot and finding a

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,450
good new package to put in the archive

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,730
is quite hard nowadays because

00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:54,210
everything that we really need is

00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:55,710
already there but we have a good

00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,980
opportunity coming that is the freeze

00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:01,380
where we need people to fix bugs and

00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,110
fixing bugs in unrelated packages is a

00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,330
very very good way to learn packages and

00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,520
to see how things are done across their

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:14,039
cavern is a very very good way to help

00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:18,559
Debian well but I don't have our sea

00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,559
bugs in mind so okay

00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:23,940
well yeah there is this the concept of

00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:26,690
box washing parties where you people

00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,460
around your city will get together and

00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:30,690
but try to fix these release critical

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,639
bugs that are preventing Debian from

00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:35,479
being released maybe we can have some of

00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:38,129
these people do that with some of you

00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:39,809
after this actually let's see some nods

00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:41,549
so that's pretty pretty good actually

00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:43,590
anyone else on this side want to

00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:45,179
introduce yourself or a part of Debian

00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:50,330
you work on and have a task you want to

00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:56,989
offer yeah hi I'm not Tony test0 I

00:31:50,330 --> 00:32:00,210
maintain ruby LXE vagrant chef red wine

00:31:56,989 --> 00:32:04,859
jquery and lots of other things that I

00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:08,820
want people to help so if you so you see

00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:12,779
that there's a lot of trendy stuff like

00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,909
chef and vagrants and redmine house is

00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:18,960
very useful but I unfortunately don't

00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:21,690
use it myself anymore so and I have a

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,840
couple of other package so if you want

00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:27,269
to help maintaining those package that

00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,779
already there is usually way better than

00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:34,340
trying to add a new package unless you

00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:38,759
actually use that new package yourself

00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:40,229
yeah I saw some other hands here if

00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,729
people wanted to talk about they wanted

00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:46,549
to yeah just hand it over anyone really

00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:46,549
oh hey

00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:58,470
does it work yeah

00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:01,830
hi I'm MIDI before being elected as DPL

00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:03,810
I was in the ochem L team and we were

00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:06,120
looking for volunteers to do packaging

00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:07,590
work and testing the applications so if

00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,440
you're interested in functional

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:14,280
programming I'll be more than happy to

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:18,510
banter and show you how okay Mel is

00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:22,440
great if you're also into Python I'm

00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:25,890
also looking for volunteers to do like

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,920
web interface for newcomers to easily

00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:30,690
find new things to do in Debian I don't

00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,170
know if you have heard about what can I

00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:36,390
do for food or a fedora and the project

00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:39,300
would be to do something like what I

00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:44,520
cannot do for Debian based on the same

00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:45,480
code by either ticket for Debian come on

00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:50,730
I thought some other hand the people

00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,770
want to talk yes I mean - no even stuck

00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:56,310
I'm Thomas

00:33:51,770 --> 00:34:00,540
oh I see I'm eating all of OpenStack in

00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:03,500
the VM and that's nearly 400 packages

00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,500
and I need help

00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,680
yeah okay actually I should probably be

00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:21,630
in on that side because I think it I

00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:26,370
don't really know whether that was just

00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:27,990
for okay well then here my teas are also

00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:35,460
for newbie because I'm a newbie to deaf

00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:37,620
corner so anyways my name is Irish ivy I

00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:41,610
was a debian no I was a you went to

00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:43,140
refugee to Debian about so you tell me

00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,700
are you are you looking for something to

00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,290
do or are you looking I'm looking for

00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:50,100
something to do a greatly I'm supposed

00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:50,910
to be then the publicity stuff okay

00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,120
well you should answer these questions

00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:57,660
for me yeah so no okay so one thing I

00:34:54,120 --> 00:35:01,820
know about Debian it's it's solid and it

00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,820
saved me a lot of headache lot of times

00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,770
what I would like to work on is

00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,320
publicity but unfortunately I just be no

00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,360
event by Def Con F lose all my grand

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,940
plans of covering Def Con adjustment for

00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,400
a toss huge toss and now I'm trying to

00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,940
see if I can somehow do something with

00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,620
that thank you and what's one thing you

00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,770
like about Debian for anything be you

00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:28,590
said I forget actually everything I mean

00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:31,940
just yeah just the huge amount of

00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:34,140
packages that I have I actually like is

00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:39,120
there's a way that you can search for

00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:43,200
packages without know without with

00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,340
keywords I I do I forget the command

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,800
right now but there's a way through

00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,980
which I can find that out not I really

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:53,430
love about it cool yeah okay so you

00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,570
should go to that side and also you

00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,830
should leave the mic where you are and

00:35:54,570 --> 00:36:10,040
see if anyone else on your side wants to

00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:13,320
talk about tasks they can offer I know

00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:16,080
doesn't work right okay dorks um and

00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:20,640
you're Thomas still yes okay I didn't

00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:23,160
change at all okay one of the packages

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,430
that I have and I'm upstream it's called

00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:32,130
the Booker anybody used it

00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:34,440
no the Booker it's a it's a small

00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:39,410
program program to build packages taken

00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:42,540
packages in docker hence Dibakar and

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,530
it's like quite experimental however

00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,880
it's in stable

00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:50,090
I mean experimental as a project not as

00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,330
a working software it actually works

00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:57,090
stay in a stable way its experimental

00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:59,820
because what I would like to do is to

00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:02,220
make contributions to Debian easier

00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:05,990
because I find them quite difficult to

00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:09,600
make like for example to provide a patch

00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:12,060
that intested yourself is actually quite

00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,620
difficult I find especially if you don't

00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,870
run Debian

00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:18,090
which is kind of like obvious but maybe

00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:20,220
but with the Booker you can actually

00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:23,400
build packages on any system that runs

00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:27,900
docker right so you could technically

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:31,410
contribute to Debian or I guess Marco's

00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:34,800
right can get runs there so so I have

00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:37,380
this small software and I kind of I'm

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,210
thinking how to make it better if you

00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,550
are interested in the kind of stuff and

00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:44,430
that could actually teach you how to

00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:47,280
package because it actually wraps around

00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:50,910
packaging and that kind of stuff so and

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,950
if you like it ok ok great

00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,930
so that would be might I mean hold more

00:37:52,950 --> 00:38:07,110
on this side if you can in there there's

00:37:54,930 --> 00:38:10,080
Tobias Emma hello oh I am Alex um I am

00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:13,230
part of the go packaging team where we

00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:16,320
maintain a lot of things that tools that

00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:18,630
play with containers for example those

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,690
are tools that are all relatively new

00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:23,430
and it's a new language also a new

00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,620
language in Debian which means we are

00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:28,560
very much behind in terms of all the

00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:30,270
libraries we have to get in and so it's

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,590
it's it's a team that went for a light

00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:36,570
from like a hundred to four hundred

00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:39,240
packages in the last six months and we

00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:41,790
are relatively a small amount of people

00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,220
so yeah if you want to help I'm sure

00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:46,200
you'll like you like it there I'm also

00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,740
very much interested in configuration

00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,800
management tools and decentralized

00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:55,320
things so like how design choice file

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,090
sharing and communications I do have

00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,090
some packages in that area if you're

00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:02,850
interested so we have only five minutes

00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:06,540
left in the session I want to sort of

00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:08,460
roleplay what good requests are from the

00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:12,450
mentor side to the mentee side are just

00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:17,550
before we switch into that so a good

00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:20,250
request is a high person you said you

00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:22,050
were interested in in packaging tool and

00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:24,510
fixing bugs and packages that you use

00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:27,000
bug number seven four nine six three six

00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,350
in cups is something where the

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,020
already patched there and I understood

00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,640
someone to test it out can you do that

00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,420
yeah I can do that great and then you

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,510
like go do that

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,520
ah and a bad one is do you want to join

00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:41,460
the cops packaging team sorry to pick on

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,990
you Cody Oh Diggs uh and then they'll be

00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,750
very confused and what about what that

00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:47,550
entails and then they'll wander off so

00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,740
it's essential for you all to think

00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,810
about some specific tasks that match the

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:57,180
the people the things that people have

00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:58,710
sent here and in you know you don't have

00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,330
to say a specific bug number but you can

00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:03,090
be like I'm sure there's a bug that you

00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,380
can test the patch for and then you'll

00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,420
probably spend like three hours with

00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,580
them helping them set up P builder and

00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,020
so on and that'll be actually good for

00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:14,910
everyone even though it might seem like

00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:16,260
a long three hours so that said unless

00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,600
anything else yeah no okay

00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,040
I what I want to do then is like stop

00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,750
videoing and switch to that like

00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:45,600
one-on-one chatting so yeah one question

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:49,380
or I can great thanks okay in degree now

00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:52,740
okay so somebody mentioned that there

00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:54,990
are many packages already in Debian but

00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:57,540
at the same time there are many orphan

00:40:54,990 --> 00:41:00,450
packages so yes so might be somebody

00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:06,090
from people interested in packaging

00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:08,100
could adopt or take care of many many

00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,420
packages without maintainers yeah and

00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,010
along those lines if one of you is

00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,600
willing to be so kind to the Debian

00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,830
project as to instead of promoting a

00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,470
specific thing you work on but instead

00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:18,690
say I want to help some people I want to

00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:20,310
help I found a random orphan package do

00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,510
you want to adopt it random mentee

00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,900
they'll say yes because they don't know

00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,410
any better

00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,690
and and they're not even wrong too

00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:31,980
because it's a great learning experience

00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:34,350
so so you know the the kind of specific

00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,700
tasks that you offer people don't have

00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,170
to be in the sub products that you work

00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,090
on they can be anything from Debbie and

00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,799
you just have to get creative to meet

00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:44,410
their needs

00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:45,789
okay so with that said I'm gonna stop

00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:50,109
being microphoned

00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:52,299
and I you all should stand up and swarm

00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:54,190
these people and you all should start

00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:57,180
talking them busts perfect asks and I'm

00:41:54,190 --> 00:42:00,690
reaching off the mic and I guess I can -

00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,690
