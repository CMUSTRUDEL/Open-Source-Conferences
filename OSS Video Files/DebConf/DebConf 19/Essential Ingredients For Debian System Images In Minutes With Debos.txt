Debian System Images are usually generated by custom scripts around debootstrap. In this talk I shall present a Debian tool (`debos`) that helps creating customized Debian System images for different environments.

`debos` has been created having embedded systems in mind. Images are customized via YAML description file, often called `recipe`. `debos` parses `debos recipes` to generate custom Debian images. `debos` is not only suitable for embedded images, but it can be used in other environments such creating VM images, cloud images, …

`debos` is core component of several Debian derivatives CI loop. It also does not require sysadmin capabilities.
