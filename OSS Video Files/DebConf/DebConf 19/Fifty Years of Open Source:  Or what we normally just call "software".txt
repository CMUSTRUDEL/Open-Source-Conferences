2019 is an interesting year.

It is the fiftieth anniversary of Unix, the Internet, Woodstock, the LGBTQ movement in the USA, and Linus' birthday.

1994 was the year that V1.0 of the Linux kernel was released, the Linux/Alpha project started, and Beowulf High Performance Computers were invented.

1999 (twenty years ago) the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) was started, and the Linux Professional Institute was formed.

Many of these projects had a fundamental change to computing, and this talk will discuss what some of those changes were and why they are important even today.
