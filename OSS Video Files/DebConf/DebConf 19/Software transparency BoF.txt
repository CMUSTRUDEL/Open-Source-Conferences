Software transparency is a proposal to make some attacks by a compromised archive detectable. In this session, we will do a quick recap of the current software transparency architecture proposal and then discuss how to proceed.

The possible areas of idea collection and discussion include:

- the current state of the implementation, what works, what doesn't
- being helpful for reproducible builds
- integration within libapt
- interface to dak
