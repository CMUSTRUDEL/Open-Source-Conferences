I am currently exploring the next phase in my life, trying to combine what I believe is important - urban resource flows, with what I enjoy - games and visualisation and beautiful things. This talk is suited for people who are interested in games, data driven  visualisation, and bringing academic work to the general public, policy and practitioners.

Imagine an augmented reality game, a mix between something like Township or SimCity and Ingress or Pokemon Go, with a visual style similar to the Lumino City game. Imagine a building game that uses real cities and real challenges – like the recent water crisis in Cape Town, where real resource limitations need to be managed. The game can start from a blank start to build your city or start with what exists in reality and modify it in certain ways (utopia or apocalypse) and play with what happens due to your decisions.

This would need a lot of different initiatives, data libraries etc to fit together well. Debian has experience in how very many different things fit together, and have experience in how different licensing options interface (or not), and maybe I can help improve this.

In this talk I will show what I try to do and what information I have found so far. I may show prototypes and what I have found in the Debian space, and probably have a whole lot of questions for the audience. I am just venturing into this and using the talk to give a deadline to my early research, so very much a work in progress. Help, comments, critique, co-presenters welcome.

I may link more strongly to a related academic initiative, Metabolism of Cities, e.g. https://prototype.metabolismofcities.org/cities/cape-town/sectors/water/

of opened a notario bye for now Mercer

00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:24,710
on the miniverse gaming and the

00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:27,410
metabolism of cities thank you bond yeah

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:31,400
my name is Brunel and I'm in the bio on

00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,500
most places especially IRC I managed to

00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,680
put this talk online so if you want to

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:41,030
follow it with me or rip it up to pieces

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,370
or whatever you're welcome before we

start just the shots are two kings

00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,220
he's couldn't make it this year he's in

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,880
South Africa but he's following

00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:54,309
enthusiastically and it's also his

00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,309
birthday today so happy birthday Kings

00:00:55,329 --> 00:01:01,219
and then secondly just thank you thank

00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,910
you for the organizers I know it's a

00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,610
very big job

00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,530
thanks for the attendees thanks for the

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,499
volunteers thank you for everyone

00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,270
working on the Debian project all of it

00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:13,100
we live in really interesting times and

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:17,420
you make it better so thank you very

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,999
much winter of ricotta okay so this talk

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,579
is in three parts what I want to do and

00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:27,560
why how I plan to do it and what I've

00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:30,020
learned so far so I used to work in the

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,119
water industry for about 10 years I was

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,340
a researcher at the University of Cape

00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,779
Town in South Africa when the worst

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,340
drought that I think we've ever

00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:43,789
experienced hit the city so there was

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,639
three years of very poor damn levels and

00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:48,979
our dams are running out and there was a

00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:51,169
very real chance that we wouldn't have

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,840
water at all so not interrupted water

00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:55,999
supply not some problem somewhere but

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,740
really just no water and no way of

00:01:55,999 --> 00:02:00,709
getting water to four and a half million

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,989
people it was really scary and we didn't

00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:08,209
know what to do and there's some more

00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:10,520
resources here and I just like this day

00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,800
zero on the 12th of April was announced

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,920
I think around the 31st of March so we

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,060
had two weeks that if something didn't

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,470
happen it would be Daisy

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,380
was a very real thing and it was really

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,989
scary as researchers we were suddenly

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,610
very famous you know which is not you

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,950
know we like working behind the scenes

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,500
and writing and not talk on radio and TV

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,790
but we were suddenly very famous and a

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,150
lot of people asked us well what should

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,459
we do and we didn't know because our

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,819
work is really about more abstract

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,890
concepts and more long-term planning and

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,569
people were asking what do we do next

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,630
week what do we do now and we didn't

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,760
know there's some more links there there

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,620
was a lot of analysis going on there was

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,660
even an article for the Brazilian

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:59,519
newspaper which I contributed to so

00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:01,230
that's cool um but at the same time we

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,299
knew as researchers that there was

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,750
enough water to go around and we did

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:09,480
have enough in theory we shouldn't have

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,549
a job even with poor governance or aging

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,830
infrastructure because even in the most

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,810
severe stage of the drought enough water

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,799
fell on the city of Cape trans major

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,859
Pole to give residents rely on

00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,810
reasonable needs so not even the drought

00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:26,280
restrictions which was a 50 liters per

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,829
person per day which the whole city

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,290
comply to which was fantastic but like a

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,600
hundred liters and so I did some math if

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,519
you want to double-check me but we

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,940
really have enough water so what was the

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,280
problem I wasn't the only there were

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,959
other people looking at how do we do

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,239
such is better because there was better

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,940
ways of doing us people all over the

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:53,609
world are looking at this and people

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,910
like South Africa we're working on water

00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:59,910
sensitive design Australia working on I

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,220
think it was water smart cities the

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,709
International Water Association talked

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,680
about water why cities China talks about

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:10,109
sponge cities America the u.s. talked

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,819
about low impact developments there was

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:13,769
also a big move towards nature based

00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:17,820
solutions so this was really a big thing

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:20,220
in the academic sphere and in all of

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,410
these cases community input was really

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,389
important for example in this graphic

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,940
from the International Water Association

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,090
IWA they talked about water wise

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,860
communities

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:34,260
and in this graphic from the Australian

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,639
initiative they actually say

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,150
community-based decision-making which

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,450
sounds very nice but on the ground this

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,330
was not what was happening that's an

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,980
actual image from community in Hout Bay

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,720
in South Africa in Cape Town

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,980
I think anyone who went to the Cape Town

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:57,220
DEFCON 3 saw this firsthand that water

00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:00,310
sensitive design is a fantastic idea but

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,840
it doesn't really work it doesn't really

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,790
work for everyday people and it

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,910
definitely doesn't work in slums and

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,340
rapidly developing areas like places in

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,020
Africa and Brazil are very good examples

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:16,060
of I mean Sao Paulo had the same

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:18,190
challenge in 2015 so how do we go about

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,950
this and I was just really frustrated

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,200
with us but fortunately I was not the

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,030
only one many other people also said

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,090
that this is actually it's a great idea

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,370
doesn't work so I read two quotes for

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,229
you next the first one expertise

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,120
discovers its limits when the

00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,539
predictable czar no longer predictable

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,200
in the time that we live now politically

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,280
environmentally with the climate

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,470
everything

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,390
nobody knows what's happening next I

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,370
tended to talk about tornadoes where

00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,990
they will and hurricanes where they say

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,310
they used to be able to model it because

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,660
they know what the way the systems did

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,760
and they could predict the path that

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,039
would follow it's not doing that anymore

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,270
and they don't know really what models

00:05:54,039 --> 00:06:00,310
to follow and what to do but the current

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,870
way that we look at expertise is that

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,240
it's based on the patriarch of the

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,160
militaristic command and control which

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,950
is based on the idea that expertise have

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,780
no limits you sit back you do your thing

00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,460
as a citizen leave the race to us we'll

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,110
take care of it and during the drought

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,310
we very much saw that that wasn't going

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,080
to work and it probably never will again

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,960
another quote from the International

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,820
Water Association's magazine was saying

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,860
and I shortened this I encourage you to

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,169
go read the whole thing by imagining

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,870
that we and our peers have the necessary

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:34,600
expertise to solve problems we limit the

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,909
experience wisdom and insight that we

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,380
draw on in finding solutions that's

00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:41,690
hampering innovation

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,880
the quote continues by assuming that we

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,670
know best we break the all-important

00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,930
connections and relationships that

00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:53,150
integrated systemic planning is built on

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,040
okay so that's great to say that it

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,110
doesn't work but how do we make

00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,300
something work that empowers everyday

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,520
people on the ground to do and to

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,380
implement what they need to do while

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,720
fitting into the big picture because

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,000
everything is connected we don't want

00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,190
people to just carry on with something

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,630
let's say upstream of a river that

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,430
pollutes and messes everything up

00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,480
downstream of a river which is really

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,250
very much what we're seeing at the

00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,690
moment that rich people do stuff they

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,100
pollute the environment the industries

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,230
and then the poor people have to suffer

00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,610
how do we make that work better how do

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:27,860
we integrate all this information the

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,570
one big issue not the only one but the

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,000
one that I want to address in the next

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,130
stage of my career is that we do not

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,440
have the data to facilitate bottom-up

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,420
decision-making it's like a picture with

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,130
low resolution it's great if you look

00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,690
from far away and you're an engineering

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,150
you look at a whole urban planning of a

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:47,060
city but when you zoom into what people

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:50,300
want to do on the streets or the

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:54,230
neighborhood we just it's pixelated you

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,180
don't know what to tell them we do not

00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,260
have a good way to communicate and work

00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,630
with different groups of professionals

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,910
and everyday people to manage our urban

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,730
resources the earlier images I showed

00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,320
you to me is beautiful but I'm willing

00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,830
to take a bit but for most of you it was

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:13,000
like okay it looks nice it doesn't

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,770
really communicate what we wanted to say

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,830
one a positive example that has already

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:21,050
occurred is this the case study from

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,530
Belize that was listed in the ESRI

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,740
argues er which is not open source on a

00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,090
magazine where they mapped a community

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,530
area with the help of the community and

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,320
asked him where does the floods happen

00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,750
and they responded and that's the the

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,520
blue or the purplish areas where the

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,230
floods mostly happened and then that

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,050
also asked where all the culverts that

00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:43,610
take the storm water away and then they

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,780
could track and see how these correlates

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,850
and hopefully do something about

00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:52,770
imagine if this could be more engaging

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:55,560
and at a larger scale so what I'm about

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,540
to suggest I know very well is hugely

00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,880
ambitious and has a low chance of

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,160
working but I keep coming back to it in

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,740
any sort of scenario workshops and work

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,860
with my colleagues and I think I should

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,830
try it if it doesn't work at least I had

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,160
a bit of fun and built a bunch of skills

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,950
so I want to build a game I want to

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,510
build a game that allows people to play

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,150
and learn at the level that they are

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,560
most comfortable at while seeing how

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:26,850
what they do fits into the bigger

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,920
picture so it's really about the data

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,890
it's about generating the data those

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,390
solutions that we need verifying and

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,550
organizing in daughter which i think is

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,280
going to be the real challenge and then

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,350
using that data I include information

00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:44,100
design here because it's like a lighter

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,730
version of games with the way that the

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,710
internet works and media at large

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,480
information and communication is no

00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,790
longer a static thing in a newspaper

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,070
it's really much more integrated and

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,710
interactive and animated just like a

00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:03,540
game it's also a way that I could

00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:06,170
potentially get some income quickly and

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,640
in the next level that could use that

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,190
those similar sort of renderings and

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,930
imagery would be the actual game that

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,430
game could then generate the people's

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,860
daughter and I'll get to how I think

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,360
that could work a little bit next um but

00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,990
and then the daughter could also be used

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,580
to build the game physics then there's a

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,650
concept called the meta ruse which I'll

00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,390
explain briefly as well and that is

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,300
where the geographic daughter gets

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:32,670
pulled in and that daughter opera be

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,620
used for good and bad purposes I admit

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,400
but it'll make the whole thing fit

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,980
together nicely

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,410
the magic verse is an augmented reality

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,190
concept and that would really just make

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,690
the whole thing more fun and more 3d and

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,610
then which underpins all of this is a

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,130
concept called the metabolism of cities

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,140
which is where academic data brings in

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:55,350
the rigor and underlying all of these

00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,459
things and the main purpose of this

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,730
currently is to

00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:02,769
advise on policies and to do traditional

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,720
research so it really is a way to

00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:08,350
interface for that better and not to

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,240
replace it so next I just want to go

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:14,110
through each of these concepts a little

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,730
bit to get us all on the same page when

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,160
I think of information design I really

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,139
just think of d3 dotter driven

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,369
documentation it's not the only thing

00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,809
out there but I just think it's the best

00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:25,569
thing in the whole wide world it's so

00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:27,249
amazing but I learned of there's

00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:29,379
obviously other things too you and I

00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:30,929
learned through this concept of d3 in

00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:33,399
this book by David McCandless

00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:36,399
information is beautiful and on the

00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,709
website you can also see other resources

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,839
and many examples of how to communicate

00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:45,579
with information effectively and

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:48,670
beautifully secondly the game so what I

00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:52,240
have this idea that you would play a

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,920
game in whatever scale you want and

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,350
probably start over a local where you

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,839
fight zombies or kill people like in

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,189
fortnight's or both things and because I

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,809
like building things are not killing

00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:04,689
people or plant things you can choose

00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:07,360
what you want to do the the clincher is

00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:10,360
that this game is built on real data and

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,220
real resources it's based in a real city

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,459
with real challenges like we heard were

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,959
the recent drugs of course that gave

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,970
boring after all because if you don't

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,290
have water you don't have water so at

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,790
higher levels you can maybe start

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,369
messing with the physical constants

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:28,029
change gravity or whatever bring in

00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:29,079
aliens but then the gamification and I

00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,999
think works with things like

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:33,490
OpenStreetMaps and raising the Debian

00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:35,439
projects is that at higher level you can

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,179
level up faster or get bonuses or some

00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:38,649
sort of thing for gathering and

00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:41,709
verifying the real daughter that's

00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:44,829
really what we need obviously this game

00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:47,199
has to be across platforms it has to be

00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:49,269
I think freemium would be good to get

00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,730
people hooked it does need to be

00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:55,839
modifiable like the Sims and obviously

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:59,920
it has to be free and open-source so

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,720
something like this this was a project

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,459
done for the Detroit inner city

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,410
development where they mapped the whole

00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:07,120
city in 3d I was really excited when I

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,699
saw this because at least I know it's

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,850
possible to do this my next step is to

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:14,060
do this in

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,040
you GIS which is free or something like

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,589
this which is a colleague of mine who is

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,779
a landscape architect and drew this and

00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,519
so I think you can make this into 3d and

00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:25,250
just make it it's so beautiful to me and

00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,709
he was also very kind to make me a whole

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,089
guide about how to do this and which you

00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:31,120
can download off my website with his

00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:35,449
permission

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:39,579
so in detail what would I like the game

00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:45,290
mechanics like Township or Sim City

00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:47,779
anesthetic or and modifying natural laws

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,910
and shape your and surroundings like a

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:52,060
game called godus I just think it's a

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,560
really nice game

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:58,339
augmented reality aspects like pokemon

00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,550
or ingress I mean it just because I'd

00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:03,470
like the papercraft quality that sort of

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:06,649
sandbox idea that you can play and shape

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,420
things and a game like luminosity I

00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:09,920
think would be good and perhaps bringing

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,720
it into real life campaigns where you

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,519
can do something with your hands

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,730
physically as well just because I like

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,970
it okay the next concept is the

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,769
Metaverse it's described as a collective

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,779
virtual shared space that's created by

00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:26,060
the convergence of virtually and hostile

00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:28,399
physical reality and persistent virtual

00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,850
space you can name an example or two of

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:36,350
where this have entered the popular

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:38,149
collective there was a movie already

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:43,670
player 1 which is the image there was

00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:45,620
also a book any takers yes I hear is no

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:50,000
crash some way they saw as Neal

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,380
Stephenson's 1992 novel smokers so it

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,790
could be good it could also be a bit

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,110
apocalyptical but i think it's going to

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:58,009
happen anyway so we can just as well

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,449
make it better so the concept of the

00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:01,279
Metaverse means forging connections

00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:04,610
across them between numerous platforms

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,199
and content and experiences allowing a

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,449
player to literally walk through a door

00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:10,519
as a 49 character this article was about

00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,709
49 and its potential to reach into the

00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,670
met hours and be in another world and

00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:17,779
using a character custom to that world

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,300
imagine if we can integrate models

00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:22,540
between different disciplines

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,170
hydrologist geologists biotechnologists

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,060
whatever and

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,649
get into the experience and gain

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,290
knowledge from the players back into

00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:32,329
those models bottom up imagine we can

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,279
break this divide that we currently have

00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:39,380
between experts and everyday people in

00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:41,269
this way the matrix is similar but it's

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,480
more augmented reality rather than

00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:46,790
virtual reality and this comes from a

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,820
magic leap company where they have

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,680
layers you have the physical world and

00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,910
in the digital world of a pin by that

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,760
which we already have with for example

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,949
cell phone coverage and Wi-Fi but then

00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,630
also it helps with mobility energy and

00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:01,370
water and I would also add sanitation

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,670
because that's where I'm working and we

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:06,019
are so in trouble and also health and

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,089
wellness communication and entertainment

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:09,829
you know very much like the Pokemon and

00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,230
ingress where you can walk around and

00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:14,810
see these holographic things that you

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,300
want to play with so they describe it as

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,130
an emergent system of systems bridging

00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,410
the physical with a digital in a

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:25,550
large-scale persistent manner within the

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:28,430
community of people then lastly the

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:30,709
metabolism of cities this is a volunteer

00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:32,540
academic initiative that assesses the

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:36,410
sustainability of cities from a systems

00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:38,600
perspective it really takes the metaphor

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,380
of a living cell or a living organism or

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,670
an ecosystem and applies that to cities

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,829
for example where you have resources

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:51,320
coming in energy water raw materials and

00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:53,839
I'm tracking emissions so co2 or

00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,060
wastewater and so you can see how they

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,100
all fit together because what we have as

00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,500
academics have seen is that when you try

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,240
to use something else and the biodiesel

00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,610
about its and all that Brazil is famous

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,630
for is an example where that was great

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,459
because you reduce your energy

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,589
dependence but suddenly you needed a lot

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,709
more water and so it's a way to link all

00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:15,169
of those things together this is an

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,780
example of Cape Town's material balance

00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:20,959
using the Sankey diagram from the d3

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,630
toolset that my colleague Paul hookman

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,850
did in for his master's thesis in 2013

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,169
and so those are the type of things that

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,059
they look at and then they can start

00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:31,220
saying you know what these emissions are

00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:34,070
way too high or you know let's see how

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,269
these things link together

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,640
Paul and his colleagues have also

00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:40,710
created a initiative called multiplicity

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,220
where they are trying to get volunteers

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,049
to volunteer their time to find the

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,700
daughter and then to coordinate it

00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:49,860
better I'm so if you're interested I

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,399
encourage you to look at that website as

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:58,460
well it is also open source and open

00:17:53,399 --> 00:18:01,019
access and community driven in their

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,880
presentations and also in that it's your

00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:05,340
appian website they have a system of how

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,789
to get these systems and daughter up and

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,559
so to link with that this is how I see

00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:12,990
it working that the Metaverse is

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,730
aquinnah they systems that the

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,769
metabolism of cities manages the data

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,820
and in the game and the information

00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:19,679
design really works with the

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,690
visualization and the models that can

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,549
help this work better and supplement the

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,880
daughter in a higher resolution for

00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:29,610
everyday people okay so what have I

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,120
learned so far manager expectations not

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:35,429
that much um I found this beautiful

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,230
little course on a recruitment website

00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:39,720
actually that went through all the tools

00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,850
that you would need or could use for

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,500
information design and so they very

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,809
nicely organized it between daughter

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,940
handling charting programming mapping

00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:50,490
and animation and I've just sort of

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,070
limited it down to which of these tools

00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,139
are open source and please feel free to

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,600
comment or supplemental you know

00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:59,490
critique any of these basically lots and

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,590
lots of Python a fair amount of

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:06,779
JavaScript QGIS in step and blender so

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,150
far managed to build my presentation in

00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,470
reveal.js

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,789
[Music]

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,039
I'm casing away with d3

00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:16,860
I'm currently busy with 3d modeling and

00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:20,669
will students be able to model a coffee

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,220
mug in blender animator as well and then

00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:26,070
next week and maybe maybe a little bit

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:29,039
this week I'll and work with GG is

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:31,830
to get a 3d landscape and then animate

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,860
the resource flows through it the big

00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,539
plan for me in the next say 15 months or

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,210
so is to learn all of these things and

00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:40,860
then develop a prototypes I don't think

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,200
I'll be able to have the real game or

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,120
maybe I would but at least a video and

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,850
animation that explains all that shows

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,580
you how

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,100
works and then also build my portfolio

00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:53,650
and get a job you get some income to

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,240
survive but then apply to initiatives

00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,890
there's a lot of competitions out there

00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,080
and that guide you in means you through

00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,910
the way I've listed three day and then

00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,640
if successful get some funding build a

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,900
team and really do this if that doesn't

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,990
work write it off as a fun experience

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,720
and move on okay so because this is

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:14,350
Debian open day just a few last comments

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,300
on why Debian firstly I think it has

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,130
experience the project has experience

00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,110
with fitting things together reliably

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,270
you can just imagine with all these

00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,790
things we're trying to fit together and

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,890
build layers on they need to be reliable

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,320
they need to be bug free they need to be

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,000
trusted and Debian is really good at

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,590
that I hear about it all the time from

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,150
Graham

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,100
it's very good for cross-platform

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,800
initiatives because you know that if

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,630
something has that stamp of approval

00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,240
almost then it'll probably work with

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,340
other things but also really because

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,080
there's a strong culture in the Debian

00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,290
project and the debconf is an example of

00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:54,280
this of bottom-up building and I think

00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:56,980
that's fantastic I'm an ultra newb so my

00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,480
plans for dev comes the dev camp and

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,610
probably the rest of them comes it's how

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,070
to learn to package really struggle this

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,750
I found a couple of resources and that

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,460
hopefully is useful to other people as

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,670
well if there's others please let me

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,900
know and I'll update the presentation

00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:13,150
they know when to start with a package

00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,280
related to information design I'll

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,590
probably join up with a team probably

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,390
the JavaScript team I'll probably try to

00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,770
adopt an orphan package because it

00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:24,550
sounds like that's a great way to start

00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:26,530
and I just found this awesome list of

00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,590
all the JavaScript packages and in these

00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:31,900
ways to search the database and find who

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,490
contributes and Chuck stuff is just all

00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,490
sorts of nice links that are found in

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:38,890
the last couple of weeks so in

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,290
conclusion what I'm trying to do I'm

00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,630
trying to build a game that allow

00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,520
bottom-up daughter gathering to make the

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,370
models that urban metabolism work on

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,470
better I think that there is

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,300
opportunities already being explored in

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,840
concepts related to the Metaverse

00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,400
and that I'd like to draw on I know that

00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,660
commercially-driven mission it's

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,610
probably a bit of surveillance or

00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,020
privacy issues and a lot of things that

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,780
we need to deal with they will have to

00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,340
be addressed but I think that it's worth

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,250
it because the bottom up door to make

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:11,820
the models better more useful so my

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:13,890
 is combining the joy of gaming the

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,740
beauty of information visualization and

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,480
the rigor of urban metabolism studies to

00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:38,190
better understand urban resource flows

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:46,850
at an everyday level I think do you need

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:46,850
the mic awesome idea thank you so much

00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:55,020
the I'm thinking that all these gamers

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:59,850
I'm not playing games myself that much

00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:01,620
but to gamers not care about privacy or

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,410
have you thought about the privacy

00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:06,600
aspects of this whole thinking because I

00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:09,030
don't recognize that is that part of the

00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,580
business plan of the premium that you

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:13,410
then suck in the people so that they get

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,540
rewards they win something and the

00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:19,770
tracking of who win who lose is that and

00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:22,290
the central part or how does that thing

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,180
thanks my honest answer is I don't know

00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,370
yet I just know that it's important I

00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,310
would imagine that at the lower levels

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:34,320
it's sort of a fictionalised thing where

00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:36,150
you have a safe game story so that sort

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,920
of shields you this so that you don't

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,780
need any of your personal data so the

00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,000
data that I would like to get is really

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,590
from the people who say I'm willing to

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,010
level up foster I want to go see if

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:49,110
there's a leak outside my home you know

00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,420
what's the what's the frequency of sewer

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,890
overflows in my neighborhood so it's

00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,560
something that you could anonymize and

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,650
then at higher levels it'll I think

00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,660
become much more maybe like that they've

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,340
been maintained esteem and developers

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,710
team where it's actually it's actually a

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,060
whole nother layer all over the game but

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,010
when you play the game it's very much

00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,530
like a game story so there's like hidden

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,990
layers

00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,670
nice with metabolisms water and layers

00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,500
on the top which is like that

00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:20,320
the people that maintain OpenStreetMaps

00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:24,310
for example what I thought as a

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,500
challenge that you're mentioning that

00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:28,090
the what could get people engaged is

00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,030
that it's something that relates to

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,980
themselves in their own streets that to

00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,020
me rings a bell up oh then it's very

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,540
difficult to then and naanum eyes it if

00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:41,110
it's tied to their own streets so you

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:44,590
can triangulate who they are and just

00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:46,240
saying that I have I have a feeling I

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,070
don't know I am NOT a researcher so I

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,450
don't know how this the days of back it

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,820
up but I have a feeling that the the

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:56,650
some of the same kind of people who care

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:59,560
about being vegetarian and saving the

00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:01,480
earth in different ways kind of some of

00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,430
them ask the conference and same people

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,920
who also care about privacy because that

00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:08,230
might be a you are dreaming that the

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,570
kind of people who want to help to

00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:12,910
research through gaming that they

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,140
hopefully not care about being

00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:17,760
triangulated back to the old

00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:20,860
neighborhood I see yeah

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,870
um so just to comment like just to help

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,640
me think through it I think the the

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,920
middle layer the actual game layer is

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,210
lace pitch that people who care about

00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,790
the environment and just care that

00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:33,010
people who like to play but I think

00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:35,110
something that I've forgotten about in

00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:37,060
the which I thought about in the early

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,670
stages of this is that you're building

00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,190
the game engine to perform in a certain

00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,690
way but then you can use that aspects of

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,900
that perhaps in a maybe a less high

00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,370
resolution so communities to help so if

00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,320
you have this game that people just play

00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,000
in some way they can say hey it'd be

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,810
great if this if I can use this for my

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,480
neighborhood you sort of folk that and

00:25:54,810 --> 00:26:01,060
bound it into your areas for more

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,590
private use but I mean I don't know

00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,270
anything about it so we're just figuring

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,130
it out as we go along but I do know that

00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:10,630
privacy and I acknowledge that privacy

00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:13,030
is very important this is related and it

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,950
might be partial answer maybe try to

00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,740
contacting people from OpenStreetMap

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:21,300
because the best mappers are taking care

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:24,720
of their community to taking

00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:28,500
- mapping oh there is new post office or

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,590
something so and it looks like they

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:35,090
somehow community of OpenStreetMap solve

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:37,860
this problem so either either they don't

00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:40,980
care about privacy so much or they have

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,420
some solutions to deal with this it's a

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,980
very good point I mean we do have a

00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,390
strong open Street community in Cape

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,730
Town which is I think well start the

00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,320
pilot as you were talking I just remind

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,070
remembered of something during the

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:55,620
drought they published a map with

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,760
people's water use per household and so

00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,780
you could see how much water your

00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,860
neighbor used and there was a huge

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:05,730
uproar about that and then the legal

00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:08,340
advisors said the court the public

00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:11,670
interest is more important than privacy

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:15,060
so for that for that example it was more

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:16,950
important to save water there was also

00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,720
people who say we don't ever want to be

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:23,340
in that situation again where you have

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,080
to make such terrible trade-offs but but

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,690
I think maybe there are ways of

00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,240
navigating it if we believe that the

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:33,060
crisis is here is enough which I do it

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,900
is but yeah they really will talk to

00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,570
OpenStreetMaps

00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,330
I just want to have something more firm

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:43,050
to show them first so we'll get there

00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:45,150
yeah and definitely use their data that

00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:48,120
I pull into I think you GIS and then

00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:50,370
pull it into a 3d topography map that's

00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,910
probably first but privacy concerns also

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,910
know today

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,839
