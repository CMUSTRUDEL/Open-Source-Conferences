It's not uncommon to see students wanting to discuss or learn a topic that isn't in the course curriculum. Without the proper references, teachers or colleagues to engage in a different topic, students may not follow that idea. One way of solving this is to find other students (and even teachers) with common interests to start developing extra curricular activities. This is how Enigma was created, a study group about privacy, cryptography and security at the University of Campinas (Brazil). In this talk, I will give an overview of the experience, share lessons learned, and discuss best practices based on the audience's experiences as well.

hello everyone so welcome to another

00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:13,780
talk so this is andré Almeida he's a

00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:17,020
computer science students at University

00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,919
of Campinas and he is going to present

00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:25,090
about creating a false study group at

00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:26,230
the university thank you and so I am

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,009
soloist doing

00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:33,239
I am Dina's kernel developer and I want

00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:39,520
to talk about free software study groups

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:43,660
University so as Allen told iron stood

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,660
at UNICAMP master computer science and

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:51,430
Unicode is the third best university in

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:55,090
Latin America we have a lot of majors in

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:57,760
engineering medicine Human Sciences is

00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,489
thought to give in free to change it is

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,899
based in in Campinas it's like see six

00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:06,939
hours from here and the first top

00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:09,940
current show is about university

00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:15,780
curriculum so we have someone here that

00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,780
is attending university right now okay

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,930
so if there's a problem in the

00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,330
university curriculum about you get in

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:28,570
touch with this problem routed there you

00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,820
it can't be fitted to everyone desires

00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,520
for example if you want to learn game

00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,159
development if you want to learn to how

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,369
to develop if free software if you want

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,260
to learn privacy hence technologies a

00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:47,560
curriculum can't attend or to all those

00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:49,900
these things so you need and also it

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,180
shouldn't because it should be generic

00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:57,000
him it should provide good in general

00:01:52,180 --> 00:02:00,400
base so you can achieve your own goals

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,100
but well let's say that I want to learn

00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,250
game development so how can we how can

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:09,759
you solve that we can for example create

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,490
Isis group I'm going to choose to the

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,550
group's here

00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:18,110
you can have some examples the first one

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:21,720
is enigma I saw the group help it

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:25,080
creating at UNICAMP so unique and

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,220
curriculums like top elect stops about

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,350
privacy security programming and hacking

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,110
and almost no one talking about the

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:37,560
social impact of technology or about

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,870
surveillance and then last year me and

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,900
for our students we join efforts to

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:48,030
create something to discuss those topic

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:51,480
is our goals are to learn about security

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,520
shows or some experiments to spread the

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,790
knowledge about true valency and how to

00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,190
fight it and also to create a friendly

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:05,700
and open environment so anyone could

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:08,550
join and our first event we give a talk

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,040
at our local conference of the

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,920
university conference and we show some

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,700
attacks like men the middle like how to

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,670
hack hard disk without encryption how to

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,450
spoof our caller ID on the cell phone

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:27,330
and about privacy issues with the

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,450
Android clipboard at the same time we

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,610
lotioned our hacking contests I capture

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,220
the flag and we got a lot of

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,920
participants at the University and also

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:43,890
we got a prize here we you can see some

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:48,090
screenshots of the challenge the

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:51,270
challenge involve out education bypass

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:55,500
involved cryptography and also binary

00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:59,550
exploitation the challenge is online you

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:02,820
know so you can check it also the

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:05,340
platform itself that we use to host the

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:10,200
challenge is free software as well and

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:14,490
you can find it at the pub and with

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:18,480
Jesus first talk with this challenge we

00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:20,580
called rotation with of the students so

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,740
the students want to learn more about

00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,020
that and then

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,630
the other students I wanted to join

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,780
nygma to talk about these top keys

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:35,610
you'll learn more about hacking and but

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:37,530
but we saw that the the knowledge of the

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,470
people who want to learn was really

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:44,099
really low so then we start our weekly

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,229
seminar by students with brief dark

00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:49,080
introduction and then a practical

00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:52,110
activity so we talked about encryptions

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:57,180
Man 3's Man 3 how it works we talked

00:04:52,110 --> 00:05:00,360
about tore open SSL Metasploit and all

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,150
those similars is driven by students to

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,599
students so anyone can suggest a topic

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:11,550
and then we help you research of all the

00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:15,240
top and then present to the group and

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:18,870
also we drive you know Linux install

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,470
files for the people that joined

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:25,919
University so because we want to spread

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:29,280
the knowledge of free software about

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:34,050
also learning how to use privacy

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:37,169
enhancing operational system this is our

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:43,199
logo we have a website as well this is a

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:47,310
a photo of one of those seminars we have

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,949
some more art here you can you can see

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:55,710
all the visual communication of a group

00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:59,639
on behind and also now I want to talk

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:04,080
about elke can't allocate camp is Linux

00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:07,770
kernel is for Linton Campinas is a Linux

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,169
current stood group UNICAMP is it main

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,680
goal is to help people get involved we

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:19,199
with Colonel Felton it was funded by two

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:22,940
collaborators Ellen and Gabrielle

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,310
Cleveland they also have a website and

00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:30,199
while an enigma we have a more organic

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:34,039
structure in select top kiss to discuss

00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:38,059
energy camp they have

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:41,389
a more formal structure is they have

00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:43,639
three phases so the initial one they

00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,680
have like four to six meetings two

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,550
introduction how the camera works on how

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,099
to start contributing so the people will

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,379
compile the kernel will boot it will

00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:57,169
test it people will learn how to see

00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:00,439
each I'll choose IRC I'll choose mail

00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:05,059
list people will send the first batch

00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:10,789
like solving called the constant issue

00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:15,050
for the so via typos and also people you

00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:17,389
have overview of some system and one

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,389
cool thing about Erica camp is that is

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:24,770
hands-on from the since the first

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:28,659
meeting and then people we start solving

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:31,520
like more useful things the kernel

00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:34,039
suggestions are gathered from talking

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:39,259
with containers grabbing the source code

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:42,050
as well and in this these phase people

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:44,809
we also give some lighting talks about

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:49,399
some specific topics like the container

00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:54,050
of macro about linking lists and about

00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:56,330
the urine matches the final step people

00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:00,199
will become carnival uppers and Here I

00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:03,769
am I am illuminated from camp and people

00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:07,339
will start participation outreach google

00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:10,330
Summer of Code off as students or

00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:14,149
mentors the paintings on their level and

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:18,860
people then will start spreading the

00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:23,559
carnival to the people so ideally you

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:27,159
should joint effort with Erica camp to

00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:31,069
teach people how to Colonel developer

00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:34,519
and now again I want to provide some

00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:39,860
tips so how can you create your own

00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:41,750
group probably you aren't alone if you

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,380
want to start a new group

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:50,150
you you should be able to find more

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:52,910
people that like that top and so the

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,760
next step is to scale a place and a time

00:08:52,910 --> 00:09:01,280
that is convenient for the organizers so

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:03,980
it's good to have one our weekly meeting

00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,710
something like that and then you

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,290
research for reference because probably

00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:13,100
there's something like that in another

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:15,470
university maybe in your country you

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,080
search contacts you see if someone can

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:21,860
help you choose that about care know

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,560
just about game development and then we

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:28,420
start stabbed Lynch some goals calendar

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:32,750
some tasks some people to carry on

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:35,620
creating things and you also need to

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:41,560
have a really good flow of communication

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:44,570
you can use some tools for that and

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,430
always remember to get feedback of the

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:50,990
people that is attending to your group

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:54,860
to learn what they want to learn and to

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,540
to know no matter your public and you

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,020
also should give powers to the people

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:03,080
you a lot of people won't believe they

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:06,050
can help you help with the group but

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,830
everyone can help if something is

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:12,290
important to people know that you also

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:15,320
should share responsibilities and

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,900
decision-making so everyone feels

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,300
included in the group everyone feels

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:24,190
like they can help in the group they can

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:27,700
make changes to the group and also

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:31,970
always respect the limits of recruit

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:35,800
yourself because not everyone have much

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:39,350
time and energy as you and then don't

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,380
push people don't get too much pressure

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,839
on people because they were going to

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,000
have to move

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,220
and most important don't panic

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,190
and always remember you have fun because

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:59,180
if you don't have fun in your group all

00:10:52,190 --> 00:11:02,600
the points you lost the points so that

00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:05,420
was some some tips that I have to and

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:10,130
now I want you to her from the audience

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:16,120
if someone have familiar experience with

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:16,120
suit group okay

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:40,610
is it me do I have to do something

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:43,430
allo hey so yesterday we made a

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:47,540
presentation we when I say we I mean

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:50,210
philosophy we are a group that actually

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,790
we do almost the same thing that you do

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,620
and we were looking at your slides and

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,140
we were oh my god that's like exactly

00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,720
the same presentation that we did

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,420
yesterday oh yes we are like really

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,940
similar but the difference is we don't

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:08,570
work only with the kernel we also have

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:16,910
people who contribute to get see and GCC

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:20,810
and whatever so yeah like really similar

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:23,390
and we should talk after the today's

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:32,180
presentation to change some ideas in

00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:34,700
whatever okay I hope you enjoy it thank

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:45,610
you you four have any question

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:45,610
suggestion yes

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:58,590
so thank you for the presentation

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:02,910
it was good to hear about your

00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:05,880
experience now thinking about because

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:08,940
I'm not a student anymore but I do want

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,480
like this kind of experience to I would

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,250
be happy to replicate this kind of

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,520
groups and to have this kind of

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:21,300
experience in my institution as a

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:25,590
teacher then how how do you think that a

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:30,570
teacher could help and promote this kind

00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:32,190
of thing without being topped down what

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:37,620
would be the strategies that you think

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:41,270
that should be what should I be thinking

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:45,510
as a teacher to not impose my own

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:47,880
interests and my own and so I'm asking

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:51,060
my student how do you think a good

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,100
teacher would help to promote this kind

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:57,300
of thing without being a student and

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,950
just promoting the peers without

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,340
application the structure of

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:07,140
teacher-student you see there I teach

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:09,720
you without that yes so imagine now you

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,900
are the teacher okay and there's no such

00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,870
group of students but you would love it

00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:19,350
to have it in your institution so how do

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:21,660
you think can you just give like just an

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:25,140
exercise and think about how you think

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:30,690
you should behave differently to promote

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:33,360
but not impose okay yeah I believe the

00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:37,730
first step is sure fine do you know if

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,730
there are some students that want you

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:47,070
yes yes but even not not specifically

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:50,790
about my case but more general like how

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,900
do teachers in universities or schools

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:58,380
could help

00:14:52,900 --> 00:15:02,920
I believe the the path is the students

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:06,400
also get some confident of some students

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:10,839
and they can promote the group by

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:14,230
themselves so it wouldn't have that that

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:19,980
kind of teacher thing you know I believe

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:23,350
that you should any teacher should

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:27,100
empower their students so they can

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:29,830
driver drive the group by their own so I

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,440
believe the problems of a teacher being

00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:37,529
top down they want an axe

00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,529
they wouldn't exist anymore make sense

00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:49,540
it does make sense but it's a real

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:52,270
challenge also good because Ally

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:56,070
when aliens create the group Alan wasn't

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:58,240
I student anymore was like an outsider

00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,730
yes so just a comment

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,430
I'm sure that about a teacher so for

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:05,740
creating allocation we had a support

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:07,060
from one of the teachers who supports be

00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,720
softer in general

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:12,790
called aztlán and she she wasn't

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,860
directly involved but she was a

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:21,670
facilitator in the sense that we needed

00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:25,450
a room to to do the meetings and she

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:29,800
helped us with that and also I think

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:33,430
that managed to do that some teachers

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:37,510
offered a credit to students and if we

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:39,880
had that it would be like very useful

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,560
because it's really clear that students

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,680
starts going to the talks to the

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,260
meetings and then when exams come and if

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,279
like they it's the first thing that they

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:53,560
they stop doing and if there's some

00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:59,560
motivation like credit to students this

00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:03,130
helps a lot and other yes so basically

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:05,290
if you cannot give credit a facilitator

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,169
and infrastructure helps a lot already

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,449
and all

00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:10,449
marketing the group to the students

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:23,530
the same question but for the university

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:30,610
the university do something for promote

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:33,070
these group and in the first in the

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:37,990
first group and you know we we don't

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:41,970
have support for teacher but we can use

00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:45,520
all the university rooms infrastructure

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:48,340
but and also as you can see there our

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,030
domain is from the University so they

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:55,870
provide structure

00:17:51,030 --> 00:18:05,230
Guto and REO structure and but from elke

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:08,110
camp they I don't so inside the

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:11,200
university there's a mailing list for

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:14,049
publishing things and but you need to

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,669
have authorization so we just sent to

00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:17,620
the University and then just they just

00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:22,480
forward to the rest of the students and

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:27,370
this was really nice yeah and at least

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:32,140
from from the enigma one thing that make

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:35,799
us start the group is that wasn't any

00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:40,020
there wasn't any teacher that was able

00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:44,830
to talk about security on the university

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:47,130
so that was something that make us great

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,130
group

00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:59,770
it's the question is more like curiosity

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:02,460
at the beginning of the course most

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:05,860
computer science and computer engineers

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:10,360
arrive at the university using Linux and

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:12,490
an open-source software and how they are

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:17,470
at the end of the course and what make

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:19,810
the change everyone at least my

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:24,790
experience everyone comes with Windows

00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:28,780
10 computer with hey I want to use my

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:32,740
individual card here you note see that's

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:35,530
is that so these are my experience

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:39,430
everyone comes with proprietary software

00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:41,980
background and then we we have the

00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:45,550
interface with we try to make that

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:48,910
install face really friendly try to

00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:54,340
explain what's going on what is free

00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:57,300
software that kind of thing and um sorry

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,300
your question about

00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:14,180
yeah we have the both of case we have a

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:18,710
lot of friends mind and we can see

00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:23,330
clearing the course they have evolution

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:25,130
this kind of open source thing so in the

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,140
end of the course I have some friends

00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,110
that are contributors

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:34,250
I have friend that is contributing Shu

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:40,670
xfce for example and as the excuse grows

00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:42,530
as they the technical skills roles they

00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,500
feel more confident to contributing to

00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:48,440
free software so we have the both case

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:51,200
who have people that you stole Linux and

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,110
say oh I don't know how to use it just

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,930
but windows back but do have a lot of

00:20:54,110 --> 00:21:01,840
good examples of people that manage to

00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,840
really get into the community

00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:16,550
do the professors encourage the students

00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:20,090
to use a free and open source software

00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:25,340
and develop or they just don't care

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:28,520
though mind generally they don't mind we

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:31,630
have one one one exception that is the

00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:35,230
teacher that helps camp that is Laney

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:38,630
she gives our course that is a project

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:41,270
he's a form of project in the project is

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:44,060
to make significant contribution to a

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:47,150
free software project so we have this

00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,890
example but they might the majority of

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:54,140
teachers really don't care

00:21:48,890 --> 00:22:04,310
the like they they use it like Apple

00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:06,350
things actually I would like to start

00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:09,610
the comment because she made a question

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:12,710
and how teachers can promote that and

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,960
actually in uni come before a complex

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:17,060
existed and enigma existed there was a

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,370
period that nothing existed but before

00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,600
there that there was a group that most

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,240
of the people that were in that group

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,280
now are really working with open source

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,500
software and it was a part of a big

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,500
group of don't remember the name and I

00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,600
would attribute that to the the reason

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,540
that I would actually I would imagine

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,940
that that happened is because there were

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:41,090
teacher that would use open source

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,500
software so that the students so this

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,530
wasn't had to work with that with those

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,000
APIs or software tweaking the Linux

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,440
kernel for example like she said yeah

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,330
probably they mentioned that this line

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,730
he did but other teachers did that in

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:56,360
other subjects and there was also groups

00:22:52,730 --> 00:23:00,500
created by the teachers to maintain for

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,960
example again to distribution inside of

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,640
a unique company so the teachers kind of

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,300
promoted that and they facilitated that

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,950
with well you said that the teachers

00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,150
don't really care but my experience

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,620
during the same course that you did is

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,660
that most of the teachers actually

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,100
demand us to use open source software we

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,320
use Linux and other stuff we don't

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,060
really contribute to anything but we at

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,669
least use them and I think that's

00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,850
something that helps

00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:25,559
if you if you can make the your students

00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,509
work with that and make them interested

00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:29,039
in that because in the end as he said is

00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:31,049
there's gonna be the student that needs

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,720
to push it so they need to be interested

00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:36,480
and so two things that you need is that

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,879
one is give them the opportunity to get

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,679
into setting up a source and two is they

00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:42,389
don't let them be overwhelmed with

00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:45,779
another content in school so they cannot

00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:50,549
focus on that and to finish it but

00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:52,350
distribution do you use I'm not going to

00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:57,299
answer that in the streaming off that

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:59,659
conference so time over sorry thank

00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,659
everyone

00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,430
