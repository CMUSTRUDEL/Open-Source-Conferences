It's not uncommon to see students wanting to discuss or learn a topic that isn't in the course curriculum. Without the proper references, teachers or colleagues to engage in a different topic, students may not follow that idea. One way of solving this is to find other students (and even teachers) with common interests to start developing extra curricular activities. This is how Enigma was created, a study group about privacy, cryptography and security at the University of Campinas (Brazil). In this talk, I will give an overview of the experience, share lessons learned, and discuss best practices based on the audience's experiences as well.
