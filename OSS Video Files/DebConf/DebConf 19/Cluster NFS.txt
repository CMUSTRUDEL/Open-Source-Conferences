This work presents the implementation of a Clustered Network File System. In 4th November 2017 we received nine old servers and it was started a recovery project [1]. As result, five servers were recovered and it has been currently used for research and educational applications. This Cluster uses five old servers (named as Amanda, Carolina, Elisa, Gabriela, and Helena) running Debian 9 (Stretch).
The Cluster is running at IFPR Telecommunications Laboratory (Labtelecom) in the internal network 192.168.1.0/24 [2]. Some characteristics of servers and network address are listed below:
Amanda - 192.168.1.3/24 - Dell Power Edge 2850 - Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.00GHz, 4G
Carolina - 192.168.1.10/24 - Dell Power Edge 2850 - Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.00GHz, 2G
Elisa - 192.168.1.12/24 - IBM X-series 346 - Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.20GHz, 256M
Gabriela - 192.168.1.14/24 - HP Proliant DL380 - Intel(R) Pentium(R) III CPU family 1133MHz, 3G
Helena - 192.168.1.16/24 - IBM E-server - Intel(R) Pentium(R) III CPU family 1133MHz, 2G
Despite of legacy hardware, each server presents some operation and management functions, such as, DHCP Server, Local repository, Multimedia Server (DLNA), FTP Server, and Fail-over. This network has an average of 75 clients per day and an expansion up to 150 clients is expected in the next two years. The goal of this talk is to introduce how some minimalist configurations on Debian can easily provide network services in a low cost cluster.
