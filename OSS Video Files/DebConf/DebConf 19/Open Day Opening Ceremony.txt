there is also one in the front desk for

00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:16,449
Debian has a policy of welcoming

00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:20,349
everyone so this is really necessary to

00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:22,150
emphasize so we we do want to have a

00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:27,300
diverse group of contributors to the

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,300
project so we want everyone really

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:35,729
yes we have buttons with the Debian

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:40,680
diversity logo in the front desk so

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:43,110
humans now so we have a local energy

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,300
Hartman team so if if there are any

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,850
complaints you can talk to Steve

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,570
McIntyre on the divine or at Leon Acosta

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,640
so any people in the orange or blue

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,720
t-shirts will know who those people are

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,720
so you can ask me in as well

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:04,440
we have no no photo spinning from death

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,170
so if you don't want to be photographed

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,040
you can get one and if you are taking

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,990
pictures please try to respect that if

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,700
you take a picture by mistake of someone

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:19,860
wearing those pins then please delete

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:25,940
the picture so we do have a picture of

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,940
the no photos page so that's this one

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:33,240
I remind about heck labs we have a few

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,550
hack labs in the hotel so the 13th floor

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,440
is the noisy heck lab but if you want to

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,020
be in silence you can go to the 12th

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,380
floor and also we have a meeting room in

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:46,440
12 floors or with a lot of faucets small

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:50,250
table so you can have like meetings with

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,780
people you want there and again even if

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,610
I'm not staying the hotel you are more

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,910
than welcome to join us in the heck lab

00:09:53,610 --> 00:10:02,250
they're here in the universe we have

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:07,380
five heck labs so rooms be ones 106 to

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:09,990
be 109 are noisy hack labs so if they

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,730
are locked it's because they there are

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,040
there's a lot of pcs there there are

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,440
teaching labs so the PCs were moved to

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,880
the back of the room but we need to keep

00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,340
them locked if there is anyone there

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,350
if there is no one there so if it's

00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,200
locked get the keys from front desk and

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,580
if you are the last to leave please lock

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,420
the door and return the key to front

00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:38,730
desk and also we have a quite high club

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:40,650
on a 105 we have the menu for the

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:44,880
conference provided food

00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:46,890
on the wiki for for those were staying

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,430
the DEF CON hotel we have breakfast

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:53,190
there and then some days that they did

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,710
the program changes so some days the

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:58,340
lunch in general here in the university

00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,660
some days they are there in the hotel so

00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,280
pay attention to the announcements so

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,610
this is all documented in the wiki but

00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,850
we will also let you guys know when they

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:11,040
win the current situation changes in

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,820
that times is a breakfast in the hotel

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:21,540
six to ten language starts at starts at

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:24,090
noon and general starts at 6:00 p.m. now

00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:28,860
a little bit about our activities year

00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:30,960
this week today is open day it's a day

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,180
of that conference targeted at the

00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,490
general public so the idea here is that

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,310
we do an introduction to Devon in free

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:42,810
software we want to broaden the deaf

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:46,590
community by getting new people to join

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:49,950
these companies is our way of doing that

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:53,100
we will have one room which is this one

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,600
with sessions insane in English and the

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,670
other two rooms for that they will be

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,610
with sessions in Portuguese so the mini

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:03,780
auditorium in the video conference rooms

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:06,960

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:42,360
schedule we have these three main

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:46,590
session rooms so which is our tutorial

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,330
mini of toy and video conference or all

00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,670
the sessions are being are going to be

00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,770
in English was David's international

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,200
project

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:58,730

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,800
lots of sessions called something buff

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,270
both means birds of a feather indeed a

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,460
discussion session so it is not a

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,860
traditional talk of one person speaking

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:11,340
in the other people listening is a

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:14,220
discussion about some aspect of Debian

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,930
that needs input from people so feel

00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:20,610
free to go to those sessions and

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:22,800
participate in the discussion we also

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,690
need volunteers for the video team so

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,500
this amazing thing that is recording

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:30,210
streaming all our talks in sessions so

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,000

maybe you came here and you had a great

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,420
idea to do a discussion represent

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,690
something you are working on and you

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:40,830
want to present then we have the space

for that unfortunately we cannot cover

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:49,250
those sessions with video so they will

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:51,780
be held in in Bruns a 102 in a 103 and

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,850

talk proposal there and then you use the

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:04,650
flip chart at that front desk to choose

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,640
a time slot for your talk and then at

00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,040
the end of the day

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,410
