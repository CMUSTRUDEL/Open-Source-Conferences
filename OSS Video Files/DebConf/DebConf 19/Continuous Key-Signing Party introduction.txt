One of DebConf’s recurring activities is the Key Signing Party. It helps Debian strengthen and expand its web of trust. This session will:

* Explain how keysigning is done in a DebConf setting
* Validate the SHA256 hash of the KSP coordination document
* Explain how to participate to people who did not send their keys in time
