00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,800
badge out of the plastic holder and

00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:52,870
unfold it you have a campus map I have

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,409
to tell you that it's forbidden to smoke

00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:59,319
on all public spaces here public closed

00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:03,849
spaces so that includes the campus and

00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:07,389
includes most of the hotel spaces as an

00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:09,669
exception you can smoke in the pool area

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:12,669
in the hotel which is upstairs from the

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:15,509
13th floor and then if you are here

00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:18,849
universe if you want to smoke you

00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:22,689
fortunately needs you need to go in the

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:26,830
streets we also can't have any alcohol

00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:30,279
here that's university policy but we do

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:34,120
and have alcohol in the hotel so the day

00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:36,069
becomes bar opens every night the 13th

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,709
floor which is the noisy heck lab and

00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:41,760
then it gets more noisy as people

00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:41,760
consume more beer

00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:48,290
if you have any questions you see people

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,049
running around with orange t-shirts

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:55,910

or doubts that you have talked to them

00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:06,889
and also I think the people in the blue

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:10,839
staff t-shirts also can help you our

00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:14,299
talk rooms cannot you cannot bring

00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:17,559
drinks or beverages or food to the talk

00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:17,559
room so please don't do that

00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:23,299
Deb confer has a code of conduct that

00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:26,509
you accepted when you registered there

00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:28,549
is a copy on in your DEP bag and also

00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:29,929
copying the front desk wall so please

00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:31,309
make sure you are familiar with the

00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:38,059
terms of the Dead product

00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:39,709
defconn's code of conduct debian is a

00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:43,160
project welcomes the participation

00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:46,850
everyone so as long as people interact

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,720
constructively with our community we

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,489
welcome everyone

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,829
so this is an important thing to have in

00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:57,470
mind and if we have we have a local

00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:59,959
inchi harrassment team which is composed

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,869
of Steve McIntyre from the divine in

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,639
adriana cost so if there are any issues

00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:07,790
during the conference you can talk to

00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:14,239
them or write an email to any harassment

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:16,910
at debian Detroit if you don't if you

00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:21,279
not like to be photographed there are no

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:24,019
photos buttons at front desk

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:28,489
this is just a joke we do have a picture

00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:29,989
of little photos pin so that's it looks

00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:32,869
like that so if you if you're taking

00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:39,410
pictures try to not take pictures of

00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:41,779
people wearing those about HEC labs like

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,970
complimenting what I what I said before

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:48,009
so we have a noisy heck Levitt in the

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,009

where you can have meetings and discuss

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:08,150
things in here at the University

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:11,660

12:00 and dinner at 6:00 p.m. so how to

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,590
get to the hotel so one thing I forgot

00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,990
to say before is that even people who

00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:23,360

get there so we are the orange rectangle

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,140
there the whole block is the UTS they

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,260
are examples so to get to the hotel you

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:43,430
cross the street north in Avenida so GM

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:45,860
bro then cross one Street northeast and

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:50,290
then the hotel is in that block on the

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:55,900
other side its front is to the to that

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:55,900
park there which is in green in the map

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:05,970
now a little bit about our activities

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:07,890
this week we had yesterday an official

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,780
job fair but we also have some of the

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:13,740
sponsors kinky sticking around for a

00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:15,270
little longer so make sure you go there

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,670
and talk to them they are showing a

00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:21,330
pretty cool stuff and most of them are

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:25,020
taking resumes for jobs as well so it's

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:27,960
probably interesting to go there and we

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:30,930
also had some people on a bench the same

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:34,260
area helping people who want to get dev

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:36,240
installed on their machines so if you

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:42,510
need help with that you can use those

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:45,690
people time to that about our our

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:48,030
program we have as I said before three

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:53,640
main talk rooms it is this one how to

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:57,090
todo menial tutorial just to the side in

00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:00,590
video conference a little bag a little

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:04,170
to the back our sessions are in English

00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:07,560
in different new to debconf you see lots

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:11,040
of sessions indicated as something off

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,960
and both means birds of a feather which

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,520
is a term that we use for discussion

00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,640
sessions so those are sessions where

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,350
it's not a regular talk if you want one

00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,630
person speaking and the other people

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,350
listening it's a discussion session

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:29,490
where people want to yea are trying to

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:33,720
plan things in the abbien and try to

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:39,360
construct a common understanding of a

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:42,330
topic our video team which is streaming

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,400
and recording all of these three talk

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:49,080
rooms really need your help so each

00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,710
session needs at least six volunteers

00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:56,010
who get it recorded in streaming with a

00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:58,950
high quality so they are doing a

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,560
training session well there's a font

00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:06,000
issue there it doesn't look like that on

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,650
my screen so that's 1330 so just after

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,460
lunch today

00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:14,100
video conference eeeh so there they're

00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,450
holding a training session where they

00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,000
will teach you how to operate the

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:22,080
cameras and the equipment in the back

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,890
room and to help us get high-quality

00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:28,230
recordings and streaming from the talks

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:31,910
so you can also join hash napkin video

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:35,490
on IRC so you can talk to the team and

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:37,980
be aware of things that they'd aren't

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,360
needed and I also watch out for the

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,870
daily announcement mails or we

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,170
constantly remind you that the DVD needs

00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,170
your help

00:15:45,860 --> 00:16:00,870
some important tips during sessions here

00:15:49,700 --> 00:16:02,640
is well that's nice okay you always need

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,670
to use a microphone to ask the question

00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,770
that's not because we in the room did

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:10,320
the microphones for to hear you but

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,360
because the people remotely need to ask

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,029
that need to hear the questions so if

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,790
you are going to ask a questions please

00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:19,589
wait for a microphone in this room we

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,250
have a standing microphone you can just

00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:24,779
walk to it or otherwise stand up and

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:28,230
wait for a microphone to ask you a

00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,730
question and if you're a speaker or a

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:35,040

so please arrive early for your talk

00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:46,529
that's why we have breaks in the

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:49,350
schedule so you should have at least 10

00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:52,040
minutes to set up before the talk starts

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,040
so please come early

00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:59,940

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:10,980
topic of the main debconf channel so

please join there and help remote

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,040

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,420
later in the week we'll have also have

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,810
lighting talks which are 5-minute talks

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:27,660
and usually we pack like 10 of them in a

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:30,990
session if you would like to do a

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:34,890
lighting talk write that email address

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:42,410
which really is lightning real at that

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:45,780
confident org we also have a few rooms

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:48,330
to spare for a doc session so if you are

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,250

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,290
discussion that's important to Devon or

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,870
something that you what would like to

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:58,410
otherwise present people you can

00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:00,000
schedule a doc sessions so the way to do

00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,840
that is to submit the session on a

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,330
napkin website and then note the ID of

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,350

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:12,570
labs in in the beginning of the the tape

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,970
after that that talked in the system and

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:19,380
then use the flip chart that's of at

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:23,220
front desk to choose a slot one of those

00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:25,830
rooms and we will at the end of every

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,510
day add those talks to the schedule so

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,660
they will show up in the web debconf

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:33,890

00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:05,240
around downtown we have park hiking

00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:07,220
which is we are going to hike in two

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:13,879
different parks and then take a bus from

have a biking tour provided the weather

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:37,460

we are not for seeing any bad weather on

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,889

00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:44,990
that's pretty much what I had thank you

00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:47,210

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,450

were just giving me by my earpiece so we

00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:27,419
in the day's weather we have we are

having meals in the hotel we have

00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:33,809
somewhat limited capacity there so we

00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:38,190
are more or less taking 200 people for

00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:40,019
each meal but they only have 120 seats

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,889
so when you are done with your meal

00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:46,440
please don't hang around for too long so

00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:53,570
that other people can also have their

00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:57,600
