Several years ago the Raspberry Pi was released to the world.  Unfortunately the computer that costs 35 USD in most countries often retails for 150 USD in Brazil due to shipping, insurance and customs duties.  In an attempt to correct this, the Raspberry Pi Foundation was brought to Brazil and two years was spent in an attempt to license and manufacture RPis in Brazil.  While ten systems were eventually produced, the request was denied.

After that another design was located, and another path was followed.  Three years later the "Labrador" was created and is now ready for large scale manufacture.  More flexible than the Raspberry Pi Model 3, faster, with more RAM and more flexibility, the Labrador will run current releases of Debian.

As the project progressed, it became a core component of the Brazilian Internet of Things (IoT) program along with a small sensor computer (the "Pulga", Portuguese for "Flea") and a soon-to-be developed small server/router system, the Bankar.  The project also morphed from being "just create a less expensive "RPi" to stimulating design and manufacturing of high quality "Open" computer systems in Latin America.

An NGO is being formed called "Caninos Loucos" ("Crazy Canines") and sophisticated plans for creating a completely Open Computing system with no binary blobs is in the works.

hi everyone please welcome to your Malik

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,439
hall and historic kind of locals

00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:26,900
creation of a nation yacht innovation

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,900
platform and let's give him an applause

00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:38,930
thank you very much I have been coming

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,640
to Latin America for over 25 years I

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:46,050
started coming here in the early days of

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:51,120
Linux and what I'm for saw was a very

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:53,760
entrepreneurial population they often

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,710
were forming little companies trying to

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,440
make money trying to make a business

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,510
I saw many conferences about free

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,089
software in fact Brazil was one of the

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,110
first countries that really embrace free

00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:08,520
software in government and in industry

00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:12,540
one of the first companies to actually

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:17,250
embed Linux into a router was here in

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,680
Brazil I also saw great University

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,259
systems where if it's a federal

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,689
university or a state university often

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:30,179
the tuition was free and it was here in

00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:34,770
1996 but I saw my first beowulf

00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:36,899
supercomputer in real life I saw lots of

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,259
research and development being done with

00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:44,159
free software and what I also saw was

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:47,100
billions of reaiize being paid to go

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,409
outside of Brazil outside of Latin

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:55,289
America to the United States or to China

00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:58,170
to purchase software or hardware that

00:01:55,289 --> 00:02:02,490
could be manufactured and designed here

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:05,399
and what this means is that not only are

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,729
you losing a lot of your money for

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,649
things that you don't have to pay for

00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:13,880
but it also means that there's less

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:18,370
money to pay local software and hardware

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:23,690
designers here in Latin America

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:26,450
so I've often had goals of a project of

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,410
using free software and free hardware or

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,970
open hardware to lower the cost of

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:36,440
computers for education we'll get more

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:39,370
into that in a moment I wanted to create

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,700
a single board computer design and

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:46,970
manufacture that in Latin America this

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,280
design and this this capability means

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,310
that it would create four jobs and

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,910
interesting jobs for people in Latin

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:59,030
America and therefore reduce the flow of

00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:01,670
people in Latin America going to the

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,070
United States going to China going to

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,670
Europe because they say this is where

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:10,760
the interesting jobs are let's have the

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,420
interesting jobs here you have a

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,630
beautiful country you have fantastic

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,420
weather great food and beautiful women

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:24,530
and not to be sexist also beautiful men

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:27,080
and I wanted to reduce this balance of

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:32,600
trade deficit for computer hardware and

00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:34,700
software now about 12 years ago there

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,390
were these professors at the University

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,640
of Cambridge who saw that students

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:43,610
coming into their classes actually knew

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,480
less about computers than the students

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:50,870
of 20 years before that because in

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,840
present day a student goes to the store

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,360
they buy a laptop computer or a desktop

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,730
computer and when that computer

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,990
someplace is this little sticker that

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:05,840
says if you open up this case you void

00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,150
your warranty and because they paid a

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,980
lot of money for that laptop or a lot of

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,600
money for that desktop they don't open

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:18,620
it up and today the student goes and

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,440
buys a game in binary only for they

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,210
don't see how the game works

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,210
they don't they can't change the game

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,760
and then maybe they write a little bit

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,279
of HTML for their website and they say

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,979
oh I'm a programmer

00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:36,369
well no I'm sorry this is not

00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:40,389
programming this is not computer science

00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:44,289
and 20 years before that you might get a

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:47,229
vic-20 or some other small computer you

00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:50,799
would pull down the source code from a

00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:53,589
bulletin board or some website and then

00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:56,649
you would try and get it to work and you

00:04:53,589 --> 00:05:00,429
might have these errors called syntax

00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:02,409
errors or runtime errors and you would

00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:04,329
have to figure out what that error was

00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:08,139
and you would have to fix it and that's

00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:10,479
why the students of 30 years ago knew

00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:14,969
more about computers than the students

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:18,479
of 12 years ago so these professors

00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:21,639
decided to create the Raspberry Pi a

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,789
computer that purposely did not have a

00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,699
case that was purposely small and cheap

00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:31,799
enough that if a student disjoined it

00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:35,439
they didn't care the target price was

00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:38,139
$35 which the Raspberry Pi Association

00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:41,559
continues to support that as their

00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:43,569
target price today and at first they

00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:45,939
thought oh well only need a thousand of

00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:48,419
these and then very quickly they

00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:50,469
realized they need 10,000 of these and

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:53,469
actually before they took their first

00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:56,769
order they had orders for a hundred

00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:59,139
thousand of these and today the

00:05:56,769 --> 00:06:01,869
Raspberry Pi has sold millions and

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:07,629
millions of systems all over the world

00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:10,389
for about the price of 35 US dollars now

00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:13,239
the problem that is happens in Brazil

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:16,179
and for the most part in lots of other

00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:19,209
Latin American countries is that there

00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:22,089
is a large import duty on these

00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:25,269
computers and in Brazil in particular

00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:29,429
the import duty is a hundred percent of

00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:32,739
the value of the imported product and

00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:35,079
they consider the value that not only be

00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:38,339
the price you pay for the product but

00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:42,009
also the shipping and also the insurance

00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:43,750
so that a $35 computer purchased from

00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:46,690
the United States

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,270
with $20 of shipping and five dollars of

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:53,430
insurance reaches the Brazilian border

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:56,980
with a price or a value of 60 US dollars

00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:02,200
it is then hit by a hundred percent duty

00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:04,300
and is now 120 US dollars and then if

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,190
it's a company to win to buy these and

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:12,070
perhaps sell them for a profit it means

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:15,130
that the street price is $150 and quite

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:19,570
frankly that's for a population whose

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:23,530
personal GDP or personal wealth per year

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:27,670
is perhaps two-thirds that of the United

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:32,980
States so this means that to them it's

00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:35,320
like it costs 200 US dollars and while a

00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,350
parent might say okay I'll purchase one

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,780
of these computers for $35 and if my

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:46,110
student if my child destroys it

00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:49,570
it's only $35 you think twice if it's

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,310
$200 you say okay you destroyed the

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:56,590
first one but don't destroy the second

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:59,320
one so this is a problem and in addition

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,590
to that the number of raspberry pies

00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,860
coming into Brazil with such a small

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:09,780
number that nobody bothered to get them

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:12,910
certified by an tell which is your radio

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,580
certification organization and so in

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:18,100
reality all of these computers if they

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:24,100
had Wi-Fi on them or if they had

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:27,360
Bluetooth were actually illegal and you

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:30,510
know so getting that certification is

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,580
important but it's also a lot of money

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:37,539
it costs about sixty thousand US dollars

00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,849
to get an tel certification if all you

00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:44,970
do is give the system to n2 I would say

00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:47,530
you do the work so these were very

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:51,100
expensive now if you had manufactured

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:53,540
that computer inside of Brazil

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:57,680
then have you followed all of the rules

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:59,720
and laws of importing the components you

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,640
find out that you may only have to pay

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:07,880
between 6 and 16 percent of the value of

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,910
the product and in some cases in some

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,780
parts that are not made in Brazil you

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:17,420
don't have to pay any import duty but as

00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,630
soon as you take those two parts and put

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:24,380
them together they are no longer

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:26,780
components taxed at 6% but they are a

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,410
finished product which is taxed at a

00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:33,470
hundred percent and so that's the secret

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,750
here is to keep these things as separate

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,500
the components as separate as humanly

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:42,290
possible and to also buy them in bulk to

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:48,500
keep down your shipping costs and to

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:50,720
manufacture them here in Brazil so the

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,910
University of South Paulo is a very

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,930
large University it's one of the best

00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:59,180
universities in Latin America they have

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,820
16,000 PhDs and a hundred thousand

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:04,970
students and they also have a complete

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:08,090
surface mount technology machine the

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:11,810
robot that puts these components onto

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:14,150
the printed circuit board and they could

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,610
actually produce systems in fact this

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,160
the surface mount technology machine

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,890
that they have is the same type of

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:29,300
machine that is used to produce cell

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:31,880
phones by LG so when I met professor Zhu

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,290
fo who is a head of the electrical

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,080
engineering and computer science

00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:39,680
department I told him that I heard

00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,320
certain insights that even though the

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,550
Chinese people do get paid less per

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,970
person per hour than people in Brazil

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:52,220
the fact is that the robot the machine

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:56,030
that actually doesn't work in Brazil

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:59,480
gets paid no more money than the machine

00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:03,200
in China it's a machine

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,900
you don't pay it an hourly wage and so

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,170
if you're producing 10,000 of these

00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:11,570
little single board computers a day you

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,780
divide up the amount of money and

00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:19,160
difference between the 10 or 15 people

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:22,010
working on that machine and you know and

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:28,630
it's a small amount of money at most

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:31,610
it's $1 per CPU one dollar per board and

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:36,620
given the same components you can

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:38,960
produce exactly the same computer so if

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,020
you took a design that was done in China

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,980
you said to the Chinese okay we're gonna

00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:48,740
pay you a license fee for your design or

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:52,460
we're gonna buy the components from you

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:55,250
in bags so that we're using exactly the

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:58,130
same components exactly the same design

00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:00,350
and it's just 2 different robots that

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,420
are putting these pieces onto the

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,290
printed circuit board you're going to

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,940
end up with exactly the same computer

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,880
which means when you put the operating

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:17,480
system on it it's going to work exactly

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:19,580
the same and then you spread all the

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,550
other things the certifications are

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,260
testing and things you find out that you

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:28,600
could actually produce these machines

00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:35,540
for one or two dollars more then you

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:37,520
would in China but you say okay if this

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,100
is true why don't more companies

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,010
actually build these little single board

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,320
computers white all these companies in

00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,110
China produce these computers and sell

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,650
them why can't we do this there are

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:54,410
actually 150 different companies in

00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:57,470
Brazil that have the surface mount

00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:00,010
technology machines but they don't

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:03,710
produce these little computers why not

00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:07,180
he costs about two to three million

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:10,730
dollars to design one of these computers

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,570
you have to hire the engineers they have

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,400
to do the design

00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,520
you have to get some components to build

00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,400
prototypes you know it costs money to

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,390
fit this design onto the surface mount

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,550
technology machine to program it itself

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,980
you have to set up the ability to to

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:32,820
import these parts you have to store

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,970
them it's a lot of money just to do the

00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:39,300
design work and then after you've

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,700
produced the little computer you need to

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,110
have an operating system on it well

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:48,900
that's easy right it's Linux no problem

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:51,420
except you have to have device drivers

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,720
for the individual components which you

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:57,750
put on the board and you want to make

00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,480
sure that the operating system works on

00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:03,900
your board and then after you've done

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,080
all that work you also have to create a

00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:09,000
market for it and maybe you say here's

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,720
my computer too everybody goes oh it's

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,840
terrible I hate it you don't sell any of

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,870
them and now you're three to four

00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:23,550
billion dollars of investment is

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:27,270
worthless so what these companies do is

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:30,390
they produce things designed by other

00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:33,630
people that they already know that

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:35,910
there's a market for them or they

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:39,830
manufacture something which is so simple

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:45,300
it needs relatively small engineering

00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:47,720
memory dims flash sticks that they know

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,780
there's a big market for these and

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:54,330
that's what they produce or they're a

00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:58,470
specialty house that produces something

00:14:54,330 --> 00:15:02,370
that has a huge profit margin medical

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:06,120
equipment industrial based products that

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:08,910
have to work in high temperatures and so

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,360
that's what they concentrate on not the

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:16,500
little single board computers like the

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:21,470
Raspberry Pi and so that's why these

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,470
boards are not designed here in Brazil

00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:27,480
however at the University of South Paulo

00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:31,570
there is this nonprofit organization

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,990
called LSI Tech they're specifically

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:37,500
designed to help companies design

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:40,720
printed circuit boards design things

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,810
desktop TVs things like that and they

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,610
have this surface mount technology

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:50,230
machine this robot that can produce

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:52,690
these boards they first designed what

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,900
they call CAD files sometimes these are

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,850
called Gerber's that tell the robot how

00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,710
to put the parts go into the printed

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,630
circuit board and actually how to

00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,420
produce a printed circuit board in the

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:07,240
first place and then they take the

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,690
circuit design and fit it to produce the

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:14,140
computers now here's the original

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:17,320
Raspberry Pi it was a single core 32-bit

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:22,740
computer it only had half a gigabyte of

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:27,700
RAM it had no real IO controller like a

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:30,580
SATA controller it had USB 2.0 which

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:36,040
quite frankly is slower than molasses on

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:40,870
a cold day but it was $35 and it just

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:43,390
hit the world byte by storm and in

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:46,570
addition to that they created a

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:49,450
foundation which helped to publicize it

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:52,330
helped to create little projects and got

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:55,300
people's imaginations going and they

00:16:52,330 --> 00:17:00,030
created companies to distribute this

00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:02,470
throughout the world except in Brazil

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,750
yes there was a company in Brazil that

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:08,140
did distribute it it was called in

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:11,589
Farnell but they were up against this

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:14,709
very high important tax and after a

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:18,550
while for for now stopped distributing

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,959
the Raspberry Pi in Brazil and so the

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:23,410
only way you could really get the

00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,930
Raspberry Pi was to have your favorite

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,569
uncle coming back from the United States

00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:32,050
please vote when in my in my luggage and

00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:34,360
you know bring it to me but that's not

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,240
the way you can create a business or a

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,490
product

00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,190
out of this there are some small

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,409
companies like Philippi flop that also

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,649
report the Raspberry Pi they work very

00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:48,169
hard to do that but again they can't

00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:52,460
import them in large quantities it's

00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:54,649
difficult so we went to the Raspberry Pi

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,840
foundation I happen to know a couple of

00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:59,539
the people on the board of directors for

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,970
the Raspberry Pi foundation and I

00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:05,750
invited one of them to come to Brazil to

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:08,899
see campus party in Sao Paulo to see the

00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:12,500
excitement and the and the technical

00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:14,750
expertise that Brazilians have in

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,279
particular and we invited them to other

00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,500
campus parties throughout Latin America

00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:21,289
and they came and they were very

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,200
interested and so we spent two years

00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:28,640
working with them we actually produced

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,830
ten raspberry PI's here in Brazil five

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,929
at the University and five and a

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:39,110
different company and they all worked

00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:41,710
and after two years they said no they

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:45,620
didn't really tell us why they said no

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:48,070
what we think is because the Raspberry

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:51,320
Pi foundation it's a British

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:54,770
organization and they had a service

00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:58,279
about technology machine in Wales which

00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:01,070
is a country in the United Kingdom and

00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:05,240
this is producing jobs for people in

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:08,840
Wales and so they didn't see a need to

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:13,100
have a vascular pie manufacturing plant

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:16,340
in Brazil now in addition to all of that

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,440
there are some technical issues with the

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,049
raspberry pie line this has changed

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,149
somewhat with the raspberry pie for so

00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:26,179
pardon me that I haven't not worked that

00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:28,820
into the talk yet but up until the

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:31,789
Raspberry Pi 3 they only had one

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:35,779
gigabyte of RAM for the raspberry pie

00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:38,299
and you when you try and run certain

00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:40,789
types of programs and applications of

00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:44,120
the raspberry pie you really need more

00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:46,980
than one gigabyte of ram to have the

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,830
application work successfully

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,980
and this makes it even worse if your

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:56,700
processor is a 64-bit processor because

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:59,760
typically you have about 30% larger code

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,070
with a 64-bit system because of the

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,970
larger addresses than you do with a

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:11,010
32-bit system the raspberry PI's up

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:16,020
until the 4 had only USB 2 at 428

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:19,890
megabits a second USB 3 is 5 gigabits a

00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:23,520
second USB 3.1 is 10 gigabits a second

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:26,910
so if what you're trying to do is i/o to

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,210
a disk through USB 2 it's going to be

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:32,130
relatively slow the operating

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:35,510
temperature of the Raspberry Pi is

00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:40,679
between 40 to 50 degrees Celsius in

00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:43,919
Brazil room temperature in Massif E is

00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,919
45 degrees Celsius that's what the air

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,530
conditioner going and so it's very

00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:53,010
difficult to operate a Raspberry Pi

00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:56,790
without a fan in those type of

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:59,820
temperatures now the Raspberry Pi 4 is

00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:02,179
actually worse than this it uses so much

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,130
power and produces so much heat that

00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:09,090
pictures of the Raspberry Pi 4 show it

00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:11,400
with a huge fan and cooling tower on it

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,850
so they've actually gone a little bit

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:18,540
backwards from the Raspberry Pi 3 with

00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:21,660
the Raspberry Pi for the raspberry PI's

00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,340
had no infrared control on them if you

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,970
wanted to use them to control your TV

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:31,730
with like say Cody you needed to add an

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:34,020
infrared USB device to the board

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:37,080
electrostatic discharge is very

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:39,630
important if you have a bare board with

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,570
no protection and you shuffle across the

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,730
carpet and you touch the board you can

00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,850
actually damage the board with a static

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,610
coming from your hands it isn't hard to

00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:53,010
build fairly good electrostatic

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:56,909
protection into a board it only costs

00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:58,059
about 15 or 20 cents per board to put

00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:01,080
that in

00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:03,429
but the Raspberry Pi people did not and

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:07,679
consequently the raspberries are

00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:10,479
susceptible to electrostatic discharge

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,700
there's no flash on the board you have

00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:16,539
to put your operating system and your

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:19,269
programs into a microSD card this has

00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:21,249
two problems number one it makes the

00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:25,059
whole system a little bit more expensive

00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:29,109
both adding the microSD card and adding

00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:32,080
the micro odd the reader itself but it

00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:34,719
also slows down the system because

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,359
accessing the data and the micro SD card

00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:41,619
is slower than accessing the data

00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:43,779
through flash and so having flash on the

00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:46,950
board makes a lot of sense from a speed

00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:49,690
perspective and a cost perspective and

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:52,989
finally the Raspberry Pi typically is a

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:55,629
single board design so if you prototype

00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:59,440
use it to prototype a solution for a

00:22:55,629 --> 00:23:02,589
customer it's difficult to then reduce

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,659
the number of components on the board to

00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:07,299
allow you to reduce the cost and the

00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:12,849
reliability and the power usage of your

00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:14,739
solution to your customer so the single

00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:17,739
board design makes the commercial

00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:19,749
designs more difficult and expensive the

00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:22,119
fact that the Wi-Fi is built on the

00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:26,559
board makes it harder to import to

00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:30,129
countries without getting an tell or FCC

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:35,499
certification and the finished product

00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:39,099
makes importing more expensive so we

00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:42,759
developed an overall plan at LSI tech to

00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:46,629
design these systems and we also did not

00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:49,830
intend on turning the university and now

00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:53,349
aside tech into a manufacturing facility

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:56,889
our idea was to have them do to design

00:23:53,349 --> 00:24:02,019
that two to three billion dollars worth

00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:05,679
of design get it to work on one SMT line

00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:07,899
and then license this out to all the

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,869
little companies throughout Brazil who

00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:11,860
have SMT lines for them to compete with

00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:15,730
each other

00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:18,519
based on ability to manufacture service

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:22,110
to the customer locality of the systems

00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:26,049
and so forth so that we would stimulate

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:29,080
this production inside of Brazil and the

00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:31,470
rest of Latin America we would then be

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,350
able to utilize the existing

00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:38,289
distributors like arrow or Farnell to

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:41,409
sell these to retailers and to end-users

00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:47,769
and then we would start doing this with

00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:50,440
other designs producing them now in

00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:52,240
Latin America there's this facility

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,029
called an agreement called the burka so

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,409
agreement and the market so agreement

00:24:55,029 --> 00:25:03,250
says if Brazil was to produce a product

00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:06,669
that 22 percent or more of the product

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:10,299
came from Brazil that they could then

00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:12,370
sell it to other countries if it's part

00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:17,169
of the burkas or agreement with no

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:21,700
additional import duty Argentina as an

00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:24,130
example pays 50% import duty when things

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,679
like the raspberry pie because they're

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:30,220
produced outside of the burqa solve

00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,580
countries so we could actually sell our

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:36,220
computers to Argentina cheaper than

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,700
Argentina can buy them from China for

00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:42,370
the same thing and so this is not just

00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,130
about Brazil is not even just about the

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:48,519
burkas all countries it's about all of

00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:51,279
the countries in Latin America even some

00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:59,019
of them that don't have a high import

00:25:51,279 --> 00:26:02,080
duty from other countries so in addition

00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:04,990
to all this by having the work done

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,169
locally we can talk with the individual

00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:10,750
customers to do things like oh you need

00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:14,559
a computer that can operate at a hundred

00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:16,600
degrees Celsius that's if you're going

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,429
to put it in a car if you're going to

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,590
put it in a tank or a plane or something

00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:23,289
like that you need to work in a high

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,660
dust environment yes we can do that for

00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:28,530
you and that is part of

00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:33,040
design capabilities at the university

00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:35,200
but in addition to that the computer

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,820
that we're designing is actually made up

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,800
of two boards one of which is a very

00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:45,730
high-speed very complex board which we

00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:49,180
call the core board that has a CPU the

00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:52,270
memory the flash and all the high-speed

00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:55,450
components the GPU all of the high-speed

00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:58,960
components on that board which is then

00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,430
attached to a second board called the

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,370
mother board or the daughter board

00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:06,580
depending on how you look at it that has

00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:10,630
all the i/o components on it all the

00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:13,420
power components and this allows you to

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:16,120
change the daughter card which is only

00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:19,320
four layers and relatively easy to

00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,270
design while keeping the core board

00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:25,060
manufactured in large quantities to cut

00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:28,180
the price down the core board is eight

00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,130
layers and is a lot harder to design

00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:34,960
because it's running at much higher

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:36,850
frequencies than the daughter card is so

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,170
one of the ways of cutting the cost is

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:44,230
saying oh I don't need to have a

00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:47,020
hardwire Ethernet on the board I can

00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,180
take that off I don't need to have an

00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:52,120
interface for a camera on the board I

00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:54,700
can take that off I don't need to have

00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:58,000
40 GPIO pins on the board I can take

00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:00,930
that off and all of these things can

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,330
reduce the cost of the daughter card and

00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:07,560
also make it more reliable and use less

00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:12,760
electricity while keeping the core board

00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:15,880
the same and so we were designing this

00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,550
in order to make it more flexible and

00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,220
create customized solutions and these

00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:24,340
daughter cards can easily be designed

00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:26,650
any place so the daughter cards could be

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,590
designed at argentina and manufactured

00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,890
there they could be designed in in

00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:34,460
Colombia and manufactured there

00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,690
and if they have the capabilities of

00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:41,970
manufacturing the core board they could

00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:45,299
do that too but there's a long term goal

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:47,520
it's a long term goal of debía it's been

00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:51,390
the long-term goal of the Free Software

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:55,200
Foundation to create a completely blob

00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:58,200
list computer no blobs for the video

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,380
cards no blobs for the device drivers no

00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,380
blobs any place so that you could see

00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:09,020
everything inside of the operating

00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:12,950
system and everything inside of the chip

00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:16,140
now I know a lot of you have heard about

00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:19,080
spyware malware being in the operating

00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:22,910
system being in the compilers it can

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,650
actually be inside of the CPU chip an

00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:28,790
Intel chip has firmware in it the

00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:32,850
firmware is a tiny little program and

00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:36,450
that firmware could be changed to create

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:38,850
a trapdoor inside the chip that you

00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,790
would never see if you looked at just

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:45,720
the operating system or just a compiler

00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:49,020
code and so if you create a completely

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,940
open chip people would be able to look

00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,460
at the mask of the chip they'd be able

00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:57,090
to follow the manufacturing process and

00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:02,160
be able to convince themselves that this

00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:04,890
chip is completely okay and that is part

00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:08,570
of our program the University of Sao

00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:12,510
Paulo has the ability and the expertise

00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:18,240
to create a Wi-Fi chip that's completely

00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:21,090
open a GPU that's completely open I mean

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,880
you may still have GPUs that are closed

00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:26,580
and obeyed by people like our more paid

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,390
by people like Nvidia and they may give

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:33,059
you a huge amount of performance but a

00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:36,240
lot of applications don't need that huge

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:39,210
about a performance and even a lower

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,690
performing chip which is completely open

00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:44,250
it's more valuable than a chip which is

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:48,090
higher performing

00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:51,090
is closed and so the university is

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:54,120
working in the long run to have

00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:58,050
completely open hardware and completely

00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:02,820
open software it's not to say that our

00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:06,450
first step on this has met that ideal we

00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:10,170
do have some closed chips in our first

00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:13,980
board but we want to replace those with

00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:15,750
completely open chips over time and so

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,480
we've created the first system called

00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:21,090
the Labrador we have actually produced a

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,610
thousand of these boards at the

00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,890
University at this point we're creating

00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:28,440
what we call seed units that go out to

00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:31,050
developers go out to people that are

00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,750
trying to make products out of it that

00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:36,690
it will drive a demand for the purchase

00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,940
of more components which will drive down

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:41,610
the cost

00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:44,190
these are specifications of the first

00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:46,650
board which we call the Labrador the

00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:49,620
name of the program is caninus Lucas

00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:52,710
crazy canines a little bit in honor of

00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,900
me the bad dog who had came up with the

00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:58,260
idea in the first place dr. Prasad

00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:02,430
Misawa zoo pho is another co-conspirator

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:05,160
he has a dog Dane and we named each one

00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:07,620
of the computers after a dog so a

00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,050
Labrador is our friendly dog very

00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:14,250
intelligent dog and we named our first

00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:17,360
computer after that now we think that

00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:20,880
this has a lot of technical superiority

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,940
to the Raspberry Pi especially the

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,320
Raspberry Pi 3 because as 2 gigabytes of

00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,750
RAM for only a 32-bit processor it runs

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,230
at a faster clock speed the device brave

00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,990
potty

00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:36,300
the testing between this board and the

00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:38,760
Raspberry Pi 3 this board runs

00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,730
applications at least as fast as a

00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:46,170
Raspberry Pi sometimes twice as fast and

00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:50,010
sometimes three times as fast it has USB

00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:51,750
3 and USB 2 so you can hook a terror you

00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,840
can hook a two and a half inch disk one

00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:56,669
here and actually use the board's power

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,909
to drive the two

00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:02,480
1/2 inch side of this it is an operating

00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:05,399
temperature of 70 degrees Celsius so

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,659
even in the 45 degree temperature of

00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:12,029
hesse feet you still have 25 degrees of

00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:15,450
difference in that that could typically

00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:18,899
be handled by a heat sink and our latest

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:21,539
core boards only use 1 watt of

00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:23,639
electrical power that's such a small

00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:28,109
amount of electrical power it doesn't

00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:30,720
generate a lot of excess heat IR control

00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:33,320
is on the motherboard the Wi-Fi chip is

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,960
on the motherboard and we have very good

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:40,259
electrostatic protection we have 16

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,840
gigabytes of flash directly on the core

00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:44,820
board so if you would have created an

00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,700
application that uses only the core

00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:50,460
board and your own design of the

00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:55,889
motherboard you have the 16 gigabytes of

00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:58,200
flash on there so as far as commercial

00:33:55,889 --> 00:34:00,779
superiority the Raspberry Pi the dual

00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,039
board design gives you the ability to

00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:07,980
prototype with your Labrador and once

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,740
you have your application developed you

00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,720
can create your own motherboard to run

00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:14,760
your application when I say a

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,059
motherboard a lot of people think oh

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,980
yeah the motherboard this little 4 inch

00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:23,069
5 by 4 inch board that's your

00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:27,020
motherboard your motherboard is actually

00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:31,079
an elevator your motherboard could be a

00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:35,730
747 airplane the motherboard could be

00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:37,829
your car it's what the core board with

00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:41,159
the brains of the computer is going to

00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:44,909
slide into that's your motherboard and

00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:47,129
that's why it's so important that there

00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:50,099
be a standard that connects your core

00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:53,250
board with your motherboard so that as a

00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:57,030
core board changes and gets faster and

00:34:53,250 --> 00:35:00,059
better and cheaper you can replace the

00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:03,359
old core board with a new one change the

00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:07,079
operating system and be able to use the

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,619
same airplane elevator and car that you

00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,619
had before

00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,750
in addition to all this the Brazilian

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,870
government started up what they call the

00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:23,680
National IOT program the national

00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:26,410
Internet of Things program they estimate

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,700
that over the next 20 years there's

00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:34,930
going to be 200 billion dollars worth of

00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:37,420
IOT related technologies done in Brazil

00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:40,960
alone and because of this they're

00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:45,220
willing to invest 20 billion US dollars

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,310
in the development of this program this

00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:51,190
program needs both hardware and software

00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:54,520
as platforms for doing this and they

00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:59,280
have accepted the Labrador as one of the

00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,280
key components of that hardware platform

00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,850
Socony dos locos has been recognized as

00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:09,130
being the national IOT hardware platform

00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,520
and we came up with three designs the

00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:15,250
Labrador which if already talked about a

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,050
bank car which is a large guard dog

00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:20,820
which we're going to be using as a

00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:26,650
server system or an IRT gateway and

00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:29,410
finally of paga a flea a very very small

00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:32,050
sensor computer about the size of a

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:34,330
10-cent piece we were going to call it

00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:36,490
the Chihuahua but we figured everybody

00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:41,620
hates chihuahuas so he called it the

00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:46,300
Pogo or flea the Polka has a very small

00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:51,100
a CPU on it it's currently based on the

00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:53,590
arm cortex systems and it can run off of

00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:56,140
a flat of of a watch battery for about

00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:58,180
six months if you put the bat much

00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:02,650
batteries in parallel it will run

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:08,090
through a year it also has 512 Kbytes of

00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:11,060
flash and 128 kilobytes of of RAM memory

00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:14,030
and it's a very small weight it uses

00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:17,120
Bluetooth mesh or lower wind to

00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:20,210
communicate and we believe that we can

00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:24,740
manufacture this for about one US dollar

00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:27,560
a piece or less with the SMT line we

00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:35,480
have we can produce 270 thousand of

00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:37,790
these every day so there's other ways of

00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,640
powering it you could use a super

00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:43,220
capacitor as so we're so attached to

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,010
that there's also a different design of

00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:48,560
the of the poga is much about the size

00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:51,350
of a credit card and that can have more

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:56,030
sensors on it and more abilities to

00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:58,910
gather data so we're looking for

00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:01,700
applications for the Labrador one

00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:05,060
application is called you do it's a

00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:08,150
point-of-sale and ERP system that's open

00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,790
source you may go to a supermarket and

00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:14,390
you see if they have a scanner they scan

00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:17,150
your food they weigh your bananas they

00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:21,530
they print off your receipt they have an

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:24,230
LCD panel a keyboard and a mouse this is

00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:26,780
something that you could replace with

00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:29,210
cheap components but if you buy this

00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,190
system from Oracle where you buy it from

00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:35,450
one of the other commercial vendors it

00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:38,360
may cost you $3,000 for this we could do

00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:42,950
the same thing with a Labrador some

00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:45,020
cheap USB devices for $300 and the rest

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:48,440
of the money could go into your pocket

00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:50,830
we're saved a small businessperson a lot

00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,140
of money in trying to implement that

00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:56,920
most of you are familiar with Cody it's

00:38:54,140 --> 00:39:01,520
a multimedia system it's free software

00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:04,790
Cody runs on the Labrador we could take

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:08,600
an inexpensive LCD panel keyboard and

00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:11,500
mouse making the Labrador actually

00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:14,810
replace the Wi-Fi router in your house

00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:17,870
hook your modem directly up to the hard

00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:21,260
wired Ethernet port and then the

00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,770
Labrador becomes your router it becomes

00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,780
your

00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,960
first connection to the Internet it

00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:29,180
becomes your multimedia Center put a

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,300
pair of inexpensive speakers on there

00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:34,970
and allow people to have access and to

00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:38,720
have a nice multimedia Center add a

00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:40,940
webcam for security and IOT controls for

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,280
home automation you have a very nice

00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:47,810
system that people could make money in

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:50,480
selling and supporting freedom box is a

00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:52,460
small server it's free software all the

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,250
components of freedom box are actually

00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:57,620
in the Debian distribution you can set

00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:00,500
up a small server for your house a web

00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,100
server you could have you know a tour

00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,290
server

00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,660
everything you want just with the

00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:09,200
freedombox software and the Labrador

00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:11,930
could drive that in people's homes as an

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,090
example of a nicer of a more funny

00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:17,030
application fretilin fire which is the

00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:19,280
open source version of Guitar Hero works

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:21,560
in the Labrador and a couple of guitars

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:27,650
I want to have it at campus party at Sao

00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:29,930
Paolo next year in examples for IOT the

00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:32,870
government is looking for applications

00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:35,720
for agriculture for tracking six cows

00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:38,150
for finding out how much fertilizer is

00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:41,030
needed in farmer's fields to cut down

00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:43,190
the price of the fertilization but also

00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:46,370
to keep the fertilizer out of streams

00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:49,820
and rivers where it creates algae growth

00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:54,110
of things like that health applications

00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:56,720
and smart cities Rio de Janeiro is using

00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:59,060
small computers like this to figure out

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,580
where the traffic jams are and where the

00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:04,340
floods are starting to happen we have

00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,500
many different partners in this program

00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:09,670
companies like smart which produce

00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:12,230
memories and stuff inside of Brazil

00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:15,230
bndes which is the investment bank in

00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:18,710
Brazil - all working with this but you

00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:22,130
can be one of our partners you can

00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:24,530
conceive of new solutions utilizing the

00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:28,010
Labrador and utilizing the Internet of

00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:31,010
Things platform and you can start to

00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:33,770
design and produce these solutions for

00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:35,600
sale inside the Brazil and around the

00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,660
world why should other

00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:41,720
country's be doing this the price of

00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:44,660
being able to create a solution has

00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,570
dropped at a point where you can be the

00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:50,330
next Mark Zuckerberg don't do that you

00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:52,820
can be better than him you can do

00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:54,950
research on batteries and super

00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:58,820
capacitors of things and you can help

00:41:54,950 --> 00:42:00,620
people learn Internet of Things now we

00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,450
have a certain amount of resources that

00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,510
are available you go to the caninus

00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:08,870
lucas org website find out more about

00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:12,170
the boards of the systems there's a free

00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:14,270
online iot class created by the

00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:18,340
university of south palo sponsored by

00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:21,080
samsung where you can get actually if

00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:25,160
both the free information it's in

00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:27,590
Spanish English and Portuguese currently

00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,630
it's using Arduino to teach Internet of

00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:34,490
Things we're adding to the Labrador to

00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:35,080
it and the company that I am chairman of

00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,240
the board

00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:41,330
LP i.org we're going to be doing a

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,790
certification what Internet of Things so

00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:46,280
you can study on your own but also get

00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:50,780
certified it actually is a little plug

00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:53,840
such a broadness here is is offering a

00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:57,080
limited number of certifications from

00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:04,250
LPI at half price here at dead confident

00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:07,070
raise your hand sir okay what is this

00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:10,190
what is the software status of this we

00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:12,440
have the three dyno kernel we have every

00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:15,940
driver for that other than the infrared

00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:18,680
we've been working on the 4.19 kernel

00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:21,350
getting drivers to be put into it with

00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,560
debian 10 support and also the five dot

00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:27,050
X Colonel series we need to have people

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,720
help us write device drivers for the

00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:32,360
missing device drivers in the 4.19

00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:37,370
kernel some of this information may be

00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:40,580
up ported from the 3.10 kernel we would

00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:43,820
love to have help doing that we also

00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:48,050
need to update the u-boot to have power

00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:49,080
vr support and also USB keyboard some of

00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:51,660
that is already

00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:54,570
we need some help in doing that we need

00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:59,220
to update the device tree in both u-boot

00:43:54,570 --> 00:44:02,430
and linux and we need to test the five

00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:04,200
dot X kernels to be able to see if any

00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:07,080
of them work and how much they work and

00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,000
whether they need work done to them then

00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,340
we need to up stream all the code we

00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,520
want every single thing about the

00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,770
Labrador and about caninus locos to be

00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:22,320
up straight there's not gonna be any

00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:26,280
proprietary code in this overtime so we

00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:29,610
need to design and embrace this program

00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:33,930
and Debian we want Debian to be the

00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:37,350
official distribution not bun - not mint

00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:39,930
not Red Hat mate is fine if there's one

00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:43,440
to port but we are concentrating on

00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:46,500
Debian and we want people to innovate

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,270
with this hardware so if you're willing

00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,550
to help

00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:53,280
augusto is I don't know if he's here in

00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:54,530
the room he's gonna be giving a talk oh

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,040
there he is back there

00:44:54,530 --> 00:45:02,190
Agosto works at LSI tech and we set up a

00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,310
website you can go see him you can say

00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:07,620
we're setting up a telegram channel and

00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:10,170
you'll convey to him your contact

00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:11,940
information your expertise and if you

00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:15,810
can help we'll make sure you get a

00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:18,600
Labrador to help with this is dr. zepho

00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:21,660
and i holding the first Labrador that

00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:24,090
came off of a pipe with that I thank you

00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,520
very much for listening there will also

00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,520
be a talk to Portuguese at five o'clock

00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,020
today

00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,970
Augusto did the talk a couple days ago

00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,590
for Deb camp but it wasn't recorded

00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,360
properly so they're gonna give it again

00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:39,120
and we coated it properly at five

00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,370
o'clock so if you know anybody that

00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,400
feels were comfortable listening to this

00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:46,530
in Portuguese that English please let

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,630
them know that the talk is going to be

00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:51,740
given at five o'clock here in the

00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,740
auditorium thank you

00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:02,190
first of all thank you very much it

00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:06,550
looks wonderful I'm a little concerned

00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:08,740
with your comments about temperature you

00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:10,570
were saying that the raspberry pi it

00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:16,030
runs at an operating temperature between

00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:17,080
35 and 40 degrees okay 40 degrees on the

00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:19,839
laboratory you were saying it was

00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:21,310
running at 70 and yet for the last beep

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,510
are you saying it wasn't suitable for

00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:25,000
use in Brazil because of the high

00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:27,550
temperatures so how does the Labrador

00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,109
work in Brazil with a 30 degree higher

00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:34,450
processor no no no the temperature the

00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:40,450
temperature the operating temperature it

00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:42,339
runs at is is set at 70 degrees so when

00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:43,839
you look at a piece of hardware it says

00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:46,150
what is the operating temperature range

00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:49,089
yeah typically young commercial will be

00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,950
up to 85 degrees centigrade right the

00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:53,920
Raspberry Pi the operating temperature

00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:56,230
range is up to 50 degrees Celsius the

00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,390
Labrador we've tested up to 70 degrees

00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:01,359
Celsius so you okay so you're saying

00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:04,690
your operating temperature is up to 50

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:06,520
degrees centigrade so I submitted to be

00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,690
such great ambient air temperature like

00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,820
right now what does that's what you say

00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:16,599
that's the ambient temperature that we

00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:18,339
guarantee it to work in and I am

00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:21,310
something you're now saying and the

00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:25,359
second point is you are saying that an

00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:29,530
emmc is vertically faster than a micro

00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:32,109
SD card when the micro SD card is going

00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:35,020
through the USB to bus yes but if it's

00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:36,730
going through an MMC bus it's the same

00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,410
micro controller to the sir it's the

00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,030
same controller board it's the same

00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:41,740
physical bus infrastructure there's

00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:45,820
different there's different speeds of

00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:47,500
emmc and that's true of an SD card they

00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:51,040
used to say controllers they used to say

00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:54,160
BAM MC bus but we we are we're using a

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,349
memory from smart which is they've

00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,300
they've got a very high speed and and

00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:02,740
not only is it high speed but it's also

00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:06,010
it doesn't wear down like original flash

00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:09,340
did it's got much better light lifetime

00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:11,080
as flash so with flash if you keep

00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,030
reading from it there's no real damage

00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,770
yeah we're talking about well I've liked

00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:17,560
that so you're saying you're using

00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:21,510
single level memory on the flash on the

00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:24,160
OMM say are you not multi-channel oh boo

00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:27,780
right go we're going to Berkeley to the

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,780
memory pass okay

00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:34,660
hyeyeon thanks a lot for sharing

00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:38,020
kirino's locos project with us I like a

00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:40,810
lot your representation and I have three

00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:44,950
questions the first one being here in

00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:48,190
Curitiba we're cool we bike can use

00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:53,650
low-cost board or the other boards the

00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:55,840
pulga the other I don't remember and is

00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:57,460
there some similar projects in an or

00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:04,780
countries having these issues with

00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:08,050
import prices like Argentina Venezuela

00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:19,660
or even Cuba that is harder situation

00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:21,550
and oh I forgot the third question let

00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:26,560
me answer the first questions first and

00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:28,810
then yes so currently can you buy the

00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,910
board the thousand boards which we

00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:34,270
produced have been produced as a

00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:38,530
non-profit research type of thing so we

00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:41,290
cannot sell them however if you say gee

00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:42,160
I can contribute this type of work to

00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:45,340
the project

00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,850
we can give you one okay you can't sell

00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,430
it to you

00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:52,180
we can give it to you in the next few

00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:54,910
days we are working with the Brazilian

00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:57,460
government because they funded fire this

00:49:54,910 --> 00:50:00,610
project to come up with a final price

00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:02,440
for the Labrador and once that price has

00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:04,090
been set then we can set up the

00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,760
distribution channel to start selling

00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:09,100
them to a lot of other people right but

00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,380
because of the way that this was funded

00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:14,490
in the first place we cannot sell these

00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:18,910
boards okay what we can give them away

00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:20,890
that's it's even better at volume now

00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:24,850
Cuba the Cubans an interesting example

00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:27,760
here because in the United States if you

00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:29,260
try and sell things to Cuba you went

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,510
into all sorts of problems with the

00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:34,750
embargo Brazil does not have that

00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:36,040
embargo with with Cuba in fact actually

00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:39,460
kind of the opposite

00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:42,520
so in Cuba there's really no reason why

00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:45,790
we could not sell the Labradors to to

00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:47,810
Cubans ok very I presume I remember the

00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:49,950
last question we go

00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:53,619
[Music]

00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:57,280
exporting can use low-cost since its

00:50:53,619 --> 00:51:01,060
developed and manufactured here in in

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:03,670
Brazil a it is possible to buy it in

00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:06,700
another countries without the problems

00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:08,290
of taxes and well again if those

00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,060
countries are part of the Burke is so

00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:13,030
agreement then there shouldn't be no

00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:14,440
problem because more than 22% of the

00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:17,590
value of the product is created in

00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:20,680
Brazil so you should be able to sell it

00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:22,750
to Argentina or to or gwei I think

00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:25,660
Venezuela is also part of the burqa so

00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:27,520
agreement and so those countries you

00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:29,890
should be able to solve without any tact

00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,840
any import taxes to that country from

00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:34,480
that country selling it to other

00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,580
countries depends on their import taxes

00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,630
of Brazilian products right and that's

00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:41,770
going to be in a country-by-country

00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:44,140
basis so we have to we have to look into

00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:48,280
that that's more that's more a problem

00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:49,480
of importers however then exporters we

00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,130
have to you have to take that into

00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:54,100
consideration when you make the product

00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:56,890
but it's I want to import something from

00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:59,109
your country I have to look at the

00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:03,040
import duties that my country levels

00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:05,980
levers on that so right now we're just

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,369
trying to solve the problem of the

00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:11,080
incredibly high import tax now the

00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:13,090
raspberry pie people actually tried to

00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,430
go to the Brazilian government and get

00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:17,410
the import tax reduced on the raspberry

00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,990
pies and the Brazilian government said

00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:21,190
no that was even before we had this

00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:26,890
project started

00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:29,349
thank you very much so I'm obviously

00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:32,170
this is a bit of a confession I have a

00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:34,150
couple of raspberry pies at home despite

00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:36,549
the freedom problems and some of the

00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:39,099
other problems with them and the reason

00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:41,740
for that is that it's really very

00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:43,980
convenient to be in an ecosystem that's

00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:46,900
got lots of other people in it who are

00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:50,619
doing stuff and that means that if I

00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:52,329
want to do something you know 1/2 or 3/4

00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:54,339
or 90% of the job has already been done

00:52:52,329 --> 00:52:56,680
by somebody else and I'm really not one

00:52:54,339 --> 00:53:01,450
of those will reinvent us unless they're

00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:03,579
really terribly triangular so are you

00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:05,319
trying to build an ecosystem that I mean

00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:08,020
that's really what the the raspberry pie

00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:11,859
thing is as has made it a success are

00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:13,420
you do you have any plans to try and I

00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:15,910
don't know piggyback on any of that

00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:18,130
what's your strategy there well my

00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:21,849
personal strategy and a lot of this

00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:25,329
depends on the total overall program but

00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:28,029
we are as I said we are looking at

00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:30,880
debian as being the main operating

00:53:28,029 --> 00:53:33,069
system on this and of course you can say

00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,130
raspbian but like a lot of other

00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:39,069
distributions it's a lot based on debian

00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:41,140
so what we're hoping as we as we get

00:53:39,069 --> 00:53:43,150
better operating system support in the

00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,890
operating system were complete as we

00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:47,440
start testing some of the raspbian

00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:50,880
applications but either from a binary

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,680
compatibility standpoint or a software

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,869
source code compatibility standpoint

00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,549
that a lot of the projects and things

00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:59,200
that work with the Raspberry Pi will

00:53:57,549 --> 00:54:01,480
work with the Labrador without change

00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,250
right I was thinking I opens as an

00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,700
example are compatible with the

00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:09,069
Raspberry Pi GPIO pins right so I mean I

00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:11,349
was thinking also about hardware

00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:13,720
compatibility if you're doing something

00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:16,329
very very short run or you know just as

00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:19,089
an experiment then you could buy some

00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:20,710
random thing and plug it in and you

00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:23,099
don't have to do any hardware design

00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:26,740
work really and it's quite convenient

00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:29,559
well I mean we do have the 40 GPIO pins

00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:33,160
to Raspberry Pi users we have USB

00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:35,050
support right so you've got a header

00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,350
that's Raspberry Pi compatible

00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:40,140
yes right that that is like you know big

00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:43,770
part of the answer to my question great

00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,770
excellent thank you

00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:52,020
somebody should make them in Wales being

00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:55,780
made in Wales they called raspberry pies

00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:57,700
yes sir thank you John

00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:59,440
and this is really exciting for me

00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:03,540
indeed I got involved in Dave I think

00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:07,270
it's Germany in 2050 20 whatever it was

00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:08,680
2014 and it was really about harder

00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,210
there's basically what I wanted to say

00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,440
so I'm really excited about this I'd

00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:13,930
love to see some South South

00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,610
collaboration if we could I don't know

00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:17,410
if we can bulk import because that's

00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:21,100
really difficult but maybe manufacture

00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:25,150
in Africa so I'd love to collaborate and

00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:29,110
talk further and really want one thank

00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:32,340
you the Brazilian government has because

00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:35,740
of their funding of this has asked that

00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:39,790
before we open up all the designs and

00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:43,420
stuff that we register it and this is to

00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:46,090
kind of protect it but our intent is to

00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:48,210
open up all the designs over time so

00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:52,080
that people could manufacture them in

00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:52,080
Africa or other places

00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:58,260
I'm sorry but we're 10 minutes overtime

00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:00,410
so we need to stop now

00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:08,280
Thanks

00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:08,280
