There are a lot of new things in APT to discover. This talk will showcase new features and improvements in apt 1.9, what my vision for apt 2.0 looks like, and what we still need to do.

I'll also discuss some changes to python-apt that will allow us to write faster python-apt applications, and showcase some noteworthy changes in other related packages such as dpkg and unattended-upgrades.
