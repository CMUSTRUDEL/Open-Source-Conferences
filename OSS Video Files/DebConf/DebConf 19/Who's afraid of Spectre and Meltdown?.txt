Architectural bugs Spectre and Meltdown have caused major panic and still worry many.  Oddly, some proposed mitigations that require installing proprietary blobs have not caused similar worries, despite growing awareness about prevalent data collection, built-in backdoors and the risks of placing too much trust in software and hardware designers with interests not aligned with those of users.  Whom can we trust, then?  What lessons are there for the Free Software community?  Being suspicious of Web blobs and foggy computing, and not victimizing anyone through them, do we have anything to fear but fear itself?

	00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:12,490
good afternoon to the last session today

00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,750
that is loud today we have the oath this

00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,209
afternoon we have the honor of speaking

00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,000
to Alex Oliva from the Free Software

00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:20,980
Foundation of Latin America and he'll be

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,050
sharing escaping the surveillance

00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,480
blackhole with free mobile computer

00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,750
knows that's the next one okay sorry

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,360
that's it that's a preview for Tuesday

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,890
today's talk is who's afraid of Spectre

00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,730
and meltdown we look forward to

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,730
listening to Alex

00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,400
[Applause]

00:00:49,800 --> 00:01:01,800
oh hello oh that's better now I can I

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:04,739
can I can hear myself so good afternoon

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,060
everyone thanks for being here thanks

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,570
for having me here I'm very pleased it's

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,860
my first half confidence so excited

00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:18,180
what's better to have a deaf come from

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:22,290
your hometown and it's awesome thanks

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,509
for the offer for the laptop and tell

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,630
the nice video folks and made it work

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,690
awesome job guys

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:35,060
I'm going to speak about these

00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:39,180
architectural computer problems that are

00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:44,990
getting a lot of people worried and well

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:50,100
I'm not someone gonna tell you why um

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:55,679
we're familiar or grandma Betties 33 uh

00:01:50,100 --> 00:02:00,380
she's a grandma who passed away but her

00:01:55,679 --> 00:02:04,530
grandson posted pictures while she was

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:07,319
sick with cancer I think I've never met

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:16,020
her but I thought she was so nice and

00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:18,840
and and and happy and and enjoyable that

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,180
I figured I would assign to her the

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,569
knowledge that I assigned to pretty much

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,690
every grandma in the world like the kind

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,130
of advice that I expected we might get

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,870
from her is that prevention is better

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:38,280
than cure we all have heard that from

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:42,510
our grandmas right we don't always live

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:45,209
by this but probably probably should

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,840
grandma when you're on your way out will

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:52,170
probably tell you to take a cult a coat

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,000
because it might get cold or well things

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:59,850
might get hot so better have protection

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:08,710
it's a it's very modern grandma but

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:11,980
grandma might also tell you because it's

00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:15,780
usually hard to control big bad wolf

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,730
once he opens the door to him

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:24,040
grandma will probably advise you to not

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:26,320
take candy from strangers because you

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,730
don't really know what's in there

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:35,380
right it's it could be dangerous

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:40,330
it'sit's very useful wisdom when I was

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:45,010
young we were taught not to run programs

00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:47,290
from strangers like there was no such

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,700
thing as the internet back then well

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:53,860
there was but I didn't have access to it

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:57,420
but the point is there were there were

00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:00,459
the equivalent of websites with large

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:04,690
repositories of software there were

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:07,720
often proprietary software and we were

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:14,190
told that it was usually not a good idea

00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:17,380
to download and run those programs now

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:21,609
this has changed over time now people

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:24,820
are taught to actually run programs from

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:27,340
any websites that they visit and these

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:32,370
programs take various forms such as

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:35,880
JavaScript or Java or or flash or I

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,880
don't know what else

00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:45,270
webassembly yeah thank you so all the

00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:47,520
sort of programs that you don't really

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:51,209
know what they're about to do in your

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,080
computer and your top to just I'll go

00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:58,649
ahead with it

00:04:52,080 --> 00:05:00,629
don't worry grandma will disagree but in

00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:05,669
truth it needs to be a lot easier to

00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:08,819
tell data from programs there was a time

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:12,659
when you had like text files and and

00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:15,389
then you had data spreadsheets and stuff

00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:17,819
like that and and and if you had if you

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,819
wanted to display them or he wanted to

00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:25,740
modify them you use the program and

00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:31,819
those are separate and then someday

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:36,269
people have this brilliant not idea of

00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:38,009
combining them suddenly you were running

00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:41,969
a program that could open a spreadsheet

00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:44,610
and there was there were programs inside

00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:48,269
the spreadsheet and they would run as

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,669
you opened them and soon enough people

00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:53,699
figure out that they could be is to

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:58,379
spread viruses computer viruses of

00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,969
course the same thing or similar thing

00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,430
is going on with JavaScript

00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:05,849
now you open a website or a computer

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:10,740
will run a lot of software from this

00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:14,939
website and although I don't really know

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:18,869
about viruses that use the sort of

00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:21,680
technique just Pratt I know that they

00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:24,779
can do a lot of different kinds of

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:30,079
damages like gathering information about

00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:33,329
you as bedroo said a couple of hours ago

00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:36,209
but also they can collect information

00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:38,669
that is in your browser and they

00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:40,409
shouldn't even have access to and this

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:45,180
is mostly what I'm going to talk about

00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:48,410
today the problem really has to do with

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:52,680
the automatic execution of

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:56,310
it is not unlike taking candy from

00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:01,560
strangers and and processing the candy

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:03,390
with your food processor built-in you

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,040
don't really know what's in there so

00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:10,950
there could be malware there could be

00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:15,330
trackers that could be crypto coin

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:18,150
miners there could be programs designed

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,210
to stop you from doing things that you

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,640
might want to do such as saving the

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:27,630
webpage viewing the source code of the

00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,750
web page or even saving a copy of a

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,240
video that you might want to watch there

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,750
are programs that implement DRM in

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,080
browsers these days and some browsers

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:43,110
are written to download and install and

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,100
run these programs automatically against

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,210
your will at times so I don't really

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,550
don't like that

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:55,980
I find it that really dangerous and it's

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,770
it's disturbing to me that it kind of

00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:03,210
defies common sense that I was taught

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:07,560
when I was young and I'm kind of happy

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:12,630
to see that some governments are sort of

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:16,680
kind of not quite seeing the light like

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:21,000
some governments are banning antivirus

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,430
software because they suspect that this

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,220
DNA virus after is controlled by a

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,760
different government that could we use

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:33,719
it to spy on them it's a legitimate fear

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:36,450
I don't have any evidence that this is

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,760
actually happening I mean that there is

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,240
spying going on through antivirus

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,190
software but there could be if the

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,100
software is not free software if you

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:50,820
cannot look at the source code and see

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:54,480
what it's what it's actually doing then

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,730
it might as well be regarded as spy

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,769
software most

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:03,120
the proprietary software that exists

00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:05,730
today is either malware or potential

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,750
malware we were done no we usually

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:12,720
cannot tell you're probably familiar

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:16,350
with the banning of mobile phones and

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:23,339
now all 5g equipment from a Chinese

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:26,190
company by the US government you might

00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:31,940
have been familiar with the attack to

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:36,480
two nuclear facilities in there Iran

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,870
allegedly by the u.s. I don't know a lot

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,810
of this but it's the sort of thing that

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:45,149
it's a sort of risk that you put

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,699
yourself into when you run software that

00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:50,639
you cannot verify that he cannot trust

00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:54,329
you you don't know what's going on in

00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:57,649
there so what I want to bring to mind is

00:09:54,329 --> 00:10:00,959
the issue of sovereignty over technology

00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:03,120
and jurisdiction over technology even if

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,350
a government could tell a company that

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,750
render services to it computing services

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:11,970
not having access to the source code to

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,040
make sure that its service is actually

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,490
being rendered properly and that

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:21,660
something else is not going on is very

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,519
important and governments are some

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:27,829
governments are beginning to pay

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,449
attention to these issues especially

00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:33,360
this is specially important when it

00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:36,029
comes to Armed Forces and to elections

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,160
if you want a democracy you certainly

00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,019
want to know what's going on in the

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,779
voting machines although I should say

00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:45,690
it's not enough to ensure that you have

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:48,959
a good election you need a lot more than

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:56,699
just machines running entirely free

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:58,699
software no although as I said

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,959
governments are kind of seeing the light

00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:04,560
and trying to protect their own

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,740
computing I'm not seeing any government

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,670
actually caring about security and

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,500
safety of

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,080
they're citizens when it comes to

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,510
computing it's like well use whatever

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,280
you you you want we're not even gonna

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:22,350
give you guidance as to what is

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:25,190
trustworthy software and what is not so

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,410
we were left on a wrong and

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,600
unfortunately a lot of people decide to

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:34,500
use none free software which to ease

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,460
this which reminds me what puts myself

00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,670
in a position of the the Alienist

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:44,220
character in the Brazilian writer story

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:46,230
though it was a doctor who find that

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,860
everyone was kinda wanna kind of crazy

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:52,470
in a way and started locking people in

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:55,470
in a hospital for treatment and suddenly

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,930
he realized that it looks like being

00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,990
crazy is normal and I'm the one who's

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,930
crazy because I'm not crazy like that

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:08,310
you know I feel like that at times but I

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:10,860
I can't convince myself I can't talk

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:14,640
myself into believing that I'm wrong on

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,670
this I think we should only use software

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:22,890
that we can trust that it we can know

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:25,380
that actually does what we want and this

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,660
is particularly important if this became

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,380
even more important when specter and

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,450
meltdown came up so is anyone having one

00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:42,090
has anyone never heard of spectra or

00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:44,400
meltdown before ok so some some time ago

00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:49,440
like a year and a half

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:51,660
some researchers figured out that there

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,180
were ways to get to information on a

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,060
computer in ways they were they were

00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:02,220
designed not to allow I'm gonna show you

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:06,240
one one specific way here but there are

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:10,050
tons of variants of these bugs that were

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,770
called spectra and meltdown that are

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:19,230
basically variants of these problems so

00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:20,959
you see if you if you can read that code

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,499
or if you can make any sense of

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,119
it's comparing two variables and then

00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:29,389
accessing your memory location given but

00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:33,319
one of the variables and then taking one

00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:36,439
bit from the value that it was read from

00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:39,769
memory and accessing another memory

00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:43,309
location based on whether that bit is 0

00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:49,040
or 1 that's what that piece of code is

00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:51,230
doing or was supposed to do now the

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,259
thing is that computers are very fast

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,050
and memory well processors are very fast

00:13:54,259 --> 00:14:00,740
and memories comparatively believe very

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,959
very slow so computer afraid to do stuff

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,649
ahead of time if the memory doesn't

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:10,429
respond as fast as you would like so say

00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:14,929
verbal is in memory and it takes a while

00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:17,929
to fetch that value from memory so in

00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:22,279
order to keep busy to keep doing useful

00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:24,800
stuff the computer will assume because

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,779
the last ten thousand nine hundred and

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,920
thirty three times it went through that

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:34,579
test X was actually less than n it will

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:38,600
assume that X is really less than n this

00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:45,110
time and go ahead and and perform the

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:48,350
conditional computation there so then it

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:51,829
tries to it just so happens at this time

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:55,069
X is actually a much larger value and it

00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:57,949
shouldn't pass the test but since it's

00:14:55,069 --> 00:15:00,949
it's speculating it will go ahead and

00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:03,499
try to access a memory location that is

00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:09,620
way out of bounds that it shouldn't even

00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:11,509
have access to you see the memory is not

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:14,929
accessible you shouldn't be able to get

00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:18,079
to its value from this program but since

00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:20,269
the computer is just speculating and if

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,779
it turns out that the assumption that it

00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:26,540
made it wrong it will undo most most of

00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,549
this stuff it won't bother to test

00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,529
whether memory is accessible at this

00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:32,590
point it was just keep going

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,800
okay well let's access is my

00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:37,960
location let's take this from it and

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:42,000
let's access this other piece of memory

00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:47,530
from it based on the value of this bit

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:52,170
and then oh well X is really less than n

00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:58,120
so never mind we wasted some computation

00:15:52,170 --> 00:16:03,580
and it throws that away the problem now

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:08,890
is your program can access the memory

00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:11,230
location C 0 or C 1 and one of them will

00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,990
have been fetched to the memory cache

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:17,080
well the other won't because it was not

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,300
accessed so you can tell the value of

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,610
the bit that it was read from the memory

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:25,030
location that he shouldn't have access

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:28,270
to so there is a an information leak

00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:30,310
there and you can get one bit and then

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:33,100
another bed and then another bit and

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:35,620
with another dose you can obtain a

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,620
credit card number that was hiding in

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:42,940
the memory of the browser or you can get

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:45,850
a cryptographic key that is or crypto

00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:53,820
wallet number that should be hiding in

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:56,740
in in protected memory so this

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:59,890
researchers have figured out how to

00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:02,320
bypass the sand boxes within browsers

00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:05,530
that JavaScript should be contained to

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:09,040
it can get to data from the browser it

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:12,459
can get to data from the user land from

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:19,510
from the kernel it can even get to theta

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:21,730
from host if your kernel one and browser

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:25,780
and then stuff were running in a virtual

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,420
machine despite virtual memory that

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,540
should protect you from

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:32,610
sort of attack so this good a lot of

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,940
people very uncomfortable and worried

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:40,200
about the kind of data that would be

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,330
exposed by just accessing your website

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:53,580
and running the JavaScript that's in

00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:56,550
there but why should you worry if you

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:59,910
have personal data on your computer yes

00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:02,700
you should probably at least be a little

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,710
concerned about that of course the

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,020
answer is not to not have any personal

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,820
data on your computer that'll be like

00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:13,610
throwing the baby away with the

00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:17,100
bathwater so what what is the real

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:19,950
solution for this kind of problem so

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,230
what we have to realize is that the

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:26,700
software that we use the software that

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:30,350
we run on our computer if it's reliable

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:33,780
or rep if it's trustworthy if you can

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:38,010
actually believe that it does what it

00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:42,330
purports to do the means if it serves

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:47,550
you if it's in your control that it

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:50,430
requires it to be free software and if

00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:54,450
you actually went through the trouble of

00:18:50,430 --> 00:19:00,390
auditing the source code and ideally use

00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:02,670
a reproducible build system then then

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,070
you might as well change the program see

00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:07,740
the program serves you each of the

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:11,400
programs running on your computer serves

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:14,040
you if these conditions are met so you

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,860
might as well have changed any of the

00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:20,070
programs to instead of having to to

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,230
exploit this feature to obtain data from

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:24,900
the other program you could change it

00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,330
the other program so as to voluntarily

00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,940
send the program to the other that party

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,220
that it was interested see if all the

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,560
programs running in your computer are

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,520
under your control and doing what you

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,200
wish

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,409
there is no

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:44,250
problem whatsoever if one program can't

00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:48,690
get data from the other now if these

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:51,620
conditions are not met then the program

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:55,740
does not serve you

00:19:51,620 --> 00:20:01,169
why should he use it it's tending to

00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:02,880
someone else's interests free software

00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:06,059
is for software there's controlled by

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,429
the user it's software that respects

00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:11,340
users essential freedoms to run the

00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:14,399
program for whatever you wish to study

00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,289
the source code and adapt it if you find

00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:19,559
that it doesn't do exactly what do you

00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:23,899
wish and these are essential freedoms

00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:27,389
that enable you to take care of yourself

00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:31,230
but there is so much software there is

00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:35,730
so much free software that nobody can

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:38,490
audit and verify and adapt all the

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:41,940
software that we use day to day so we

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:44,610
need additional freedoms that enable the

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,169
community to work together and these are

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,110
the freedoms to make copies and

00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:51,630
distribute them to whoever you wish and

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,779
to improve the software and distribute

00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,480
improvements if you can do all of these

00:20:54,779 --> 00:21:01,289
then you can form a community like

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:04,620
Damien that cooperates that collaborates

00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:07,080
to make great saw up to to make and

00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:10,769
distribute and make available great

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,909
software free software software that

00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:18,299
serves the users software that does not

00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:22,519
control the users but rather softer that

00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:25,710
is controlled by the users and therefore

00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:29,039
softer that as long as the user can

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:32,279
trust the people who did the auditing in

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:35,899
packaging and verification it's softer

00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:35,899
that is safe to run despite

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,399
meltdown inspector

00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:46,859
so you see we is to promote free

00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:50,190
software only on the grounds that is it

00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:53,340
is a human right you are entitled to

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:57,509
control your own computing as much as

00:21:53,340 --> 00:22:01,499
you're entitled to control or to to to

00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:03,960
and to express your own thoughts this is

00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:07,440
a matter of human rights it's an

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,159
essential freedom for life in the

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,729
digital environment now we we add

00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:19,679
another layer of importance to software

00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:23,580
freedom which is your data security you

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,320
need the entire operating system to be

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,109
free software and to be under your

00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,379
control and audited by people that you

00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:34,320
trust you need all the applications that

00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:36,719
you use to do that as well you need all

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,139
the libraries all the plugins all the

00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:44,609
add-ons however you call them you need

00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:46,889
them to be trustworthy you need all the

00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:50,789
software that is embedded and data files

00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:54,389
to be trustworthy you need all the

00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:58,619
drivers all the firmware even the

00:22:54,389 --> 00:23:00,890
microcode ideally should be free

00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:04,280
software

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,420
and if be of these pieces are not free

00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,940
software

00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:13,190
I call them fake news they're not free

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:18,020
software they're not in line with the

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:25,100
values of canoe you better not use them

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:27,049
oh then I'll just use a web service as a

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,950
substitute for the software

00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:33,620
well that's worse because then besides

00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:38,059
giving up control over your computing

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:40,669
you voluntarily offer grant control over

00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:43,100
your data so it's it's worse

00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:46,580
you don't even stand a chance of reverse

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:50,059
engineering the software and modifying

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:55,280
it to do what do you wish so don't do

00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:57,470
that now people ask me about well

00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:03,160
virtual machines and hiring virtual

00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:03,160
machines so is is all is every kind of

00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:11,540
using third-party computers to do your

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:15,140
bidding wrong or is that something that

00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:18,380
should be avoided in all cases it's it's

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:20,390
not so let's let's look at the case if

00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,880
you have a local computer well make sure

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:26,500
it doesn't run doesn't heaven tell me or

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:30,410
AMD PSB those are backdoors that it will

00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:32,600
run underneath the operating system and

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:36,679
enable third parties to control your

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:39,200
computer remotely so if you steer away

00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,590
from that that's and that is that it's

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,840
not a small preposition these days let's

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,110
compare that with having your own

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,840
computer locally running here or

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:53,809
remotely that's your own computer still

00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,770
and it's runny and someone else's data

00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:59,570
center there's nothing wrong with that

00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:02,119
sure you you you you you place a little

00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:05,539
trust on the data center

00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:08,329
manager but that's not they don't have

00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:10,689
control over your computing as long as

00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:17,359
you use your computer you should be fine

00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:21,379
no say you instead of using your own

00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:24,429
computer you hire you rent for instance

00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:27,469
a computer from the data center manager

00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:30,349
that's still fine you'll still have

00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:34,069
access you still have control over your

00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:36,399
in computing if you trust the service

00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:39,739
provider that should be fine

00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:42,709
now what if the service provider is

00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:45,589
interested in saving costs and they

00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:49,669
actually have a single machine with

00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:53,899
multiple tenants well if the service

00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:56,629
provider maintains each tenant separate

00:25:53,899 --> 00:26:01,309
from the other so that they cannot look

00:25:56,629 --> 00:26:04,489
at the other's computing or data and so

00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:07,999
that the hardly can tell that they're

00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:11,119
sharing the same computer there is no

00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:14,479
ethical problem there they're not

00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:19,089
actually taking over control over your

00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:22,219
computing they're not getting your data

00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:27,319
they're not controlling your your life

00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:30,979
through your computer so that's fine the

00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:34,039
problem for them not for you well

00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:37,389
directly for you the problem for them is

00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:41,239
that Spectre in meltdown brought down

00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:44,949
the walls that separated one tenant from

00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:50,329
the other and now it became much harder

00:26:44,949 --> 00:26:53,739
to keep them actually separate so in a

00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:57,229
way it's their problem to solve if they

00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:59,889
were serious about computing freedom

00:26:57,229 --> 00:27:03,309
they for themselves they would actually

00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:05,059
separate tenants in different computers

00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:08,209
physical

00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:10,909
of course that's a lot of costs involved

00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:14,779
in that so they're probably not doing

00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:18,259
that and so you're probably exposed not

00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:20,989
to the past variants of Spectre and

00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:24,279
meltdown but to the future ones that

00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:24,279
have not been announced yet

00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:32,599
of course vendors of these kind of

00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:34,639
services have panicked and users have

00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:37,009
worried about the separation of their

00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:40,639
data and they might as well worry

00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:44,299
shared computers are an illusion that

00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:48,049
we'd like to pretend that we can

00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:50,389
actually enforce but in reality it's

00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:53,719
been a very long time since we could

00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:55,789
actually trust that separate threats

00:27:53,719 --> 00:28:01,039
could not interfere with each other

00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:04,189
running on the same computer so there's

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:07,329
a real risk there I prefer to do my

00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:10,699
computing on my own computer

00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:14,299
now some people listen to this and think

00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:18,169
well but you're saying that having all

00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:20,479
the freedoms is enough for for the

00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:24,519
software to be secure no I'm not saying

00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:28,489
that I'm saying that it's a prerequisite

00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:31,159
it's essential but it's not enough if

00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:33,799
you have the four freedoms then you can

00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:36,019
audit the source code you can modify the

00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:38,899
program solidity that's what we should

00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:42,169
can do that in community but you have to

00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:46,339
actually make sure that the code does

00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:49,479
what you wish otherwise you're no safer

00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:54,319
than without it from the four freedoms

00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:57,469
but the fact that this source code is

00:28:54,319 --> 00:29:01,309
available makes it less likely that

00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:03,229
people will actually in bad undesirable

00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:07,189
features in them it doesn't make it

00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:10,869
impossible but people will actually try

00:29:07,189 --> 00:29:14,389
to avoid and prevent that from happening

00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:15,430
they'll be granting control over their

00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:17,740
users

00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:20,560
third parties which most free software

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:26,940
developers and distributors did not want

00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:31,000
to do now we can defend ourselves

00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:36,370
because we have the Four Freedoms we can

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:39,580
help each other say if someone tried to

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:43,470
to post a patch to some free software

00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:48,370
project to introduce malicious feature

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:49,560
it's usually the case that it will be

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:55,720
caught

00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:59,890
not always there's no guarantee being a

00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:03,520
life is risk but odds are that it will

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:08,130
be caught especially if it's an attempt

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:11,020
to deliberately exploit one of these

00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:15,040
architectural blood because he exploits

00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:18,900
are actually quite elaborate they would

00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:22,210
like jump out if someone tried to - to

00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:28,690
put them in this part of some other

00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:31,870
feature I think I like to trust our code

00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:35,130
reviewers to catch that on contribution

00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:39,490
if not there are people who occasionally

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:42,880
go through various key free software

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,980
projects - to catch problems so the fact

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:50,140
that the attack is actually quite

00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:53,980
elaborate makes it less likely to be put

00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:57,060
in deliberately as for accidental errors

00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:01,870
well third there are tons of those

00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:04,870
that's why it's so important to to have

00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:08,860
the freedoms to fix them and not depend

00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:15,700
on the software supplier but the fact

00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:17,470
that their barriers against the for

00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,200
instance the undesirable access to

00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:24,640
protected memory built into the

00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:27,910
computers those are meant to to

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,809
those who likely block accidental errors

00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:35,620
that could be exploited to access memory

00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:40,840
and in on several ways

00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:43,450
so these barriers remain up now there's

00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,940
spill that's factored that that is one

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:49,059
of the parents of the specter bug that

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:52,120
can be exploited over the network well

00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:54,100
yeah that is one of them

00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,070
there is one variant that you actually

00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,350
should worry to some extent about and

00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,200
the defense is that free software offer

00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:05,549
you for them is that people can audit

00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:09,700
the source code that could be vulnerable

00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:13,900
to remote exploitation and fix those so

00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:18,280
we can defend ourselves as opposed to

00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:22,450
the other variants there they're all one

00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:25,419
after the other have fallen to your

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,700
having control over your computing this

00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:36,790
one is the exception that we actual need

00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:39,250
action more action to get rid of and

00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:44,400
then there is the worldwide execution

00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:49,270
lab that's my color that way because

00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:52,450
it's kind of we're being executed as

00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:57,100
opposed to the software so there are web

00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:59,309
pages with all sorts of proprietary

00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,309
software

00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:06,809
and that we're taught to happily run in

00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:10,589
our computers and talk to actually allow

00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:17,309
it to run and no not mind about that

00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:19,409
that's that's very bad practice well

00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:21,659
grandma would not approve of that let's

00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:25,499
put it this way

00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:27,179
so our various ways you can use you can

00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:29,479
avoid you can prevent that from

00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:32,819
happening on your computer even though

00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:35,519
developers are so happy to add

00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:38,839
JavaScript to their webpages you can

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:42,349
defend yourself from that we as users

00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:46,079
should demand developers to offer

00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:49,529
JavaScript free variants or at least a

00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:52,079
small degradation is okay but but the

00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:56,369
service should run the website should

00:33:52,079 --> 00:34:00,089
run without your letting the big bad

00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:01,799
wolf in so what can you do we can use

00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:04,499
new libera Jas

00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:09,809
that's a plugin for Firefox and variants

00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:12,259
thereof that will verify the every piece

00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:15,990
of JavaScript that is in a web page and

00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:19,500
will only allow it to run if it carries

00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:22,649
a free software license well that's good

00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:27,419
if your goal is to only run free

00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:30,210
software in your computer but it's it's

00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:33,599
it's not enough because there could be

00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:36,299
free software that does bad things in

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,109
your computer so you have to do more

00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:42,960
than that you can use Liberty as code

00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:46,429
auditing features to actually look at

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,339
the JavaScript that is in there and

00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:52,500
decide whether or not you want to run it

00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:55,200
no script will help you with that

00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:58,049
because it will block all JavaScript by

00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,220
default and then you can decide on a per

00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:03,090
website per source basis which pieces

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,260
you want to run

00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:10,950
there is grease monkey breeze monkey

00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:14,160
that's a tool to write user scripts that

00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:17,100
modify what a web page looks like so we

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:21,360
can use that to selectively enable or

00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:24,270
disable JavaScript and and adapt a web

00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,370
page so better the web page does what

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:29,280
you want so that the software on the web

00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,900
page does what do you want that's one of

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,220
the essential freedoms of free software

00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:37,260
after all there is I didn't mention it

00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,050
here but there is he you matrix it's

00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:43,920
it's it was shown by Pedro as well it's

00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:47,160
another tool to control what you want to

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,310
enable to run on your computer and this

00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:55,140
is essential but these tools are hard to

00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:58,920
use we need easier tools for users to

00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:02,610
enable or disable javascript or whatever

00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:06,120
a browser could run from a website from

00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:08,460
a random website to guarantee that we

00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,820
keep the freedoms and to guarantee that

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,400
we keep the security of our systems so

00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,520
we need to be able to audit to adapt and

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,490
even to select and replace versions of

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,790
software that is running as part of a

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:25,920
website we need to control to put

00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:28,680
control back in the hands of the users

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:33,030
and if the users do not gather control

00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:35,280
back it's better be blocked and then I

00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:38,760
showed these ideas to a friend of mine I

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,370
used to work at Red Hat and and he he

00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,970
was very deeply involved with Specter

00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:46,320
meltdown I said well your argument

00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,240
doesn't make sense

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,290
because the moment you access a website

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,120
with JavaScript everything is lost

00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:56,400
exactly that's that's what I'm saying

00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:59,040
you shouldn't do that

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,470
you should block JavaScript unless you

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,720
can audit it just like you shouldn't

00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:06,360
download any software from any random

00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:14,310
source and run it before we get a chance

00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:16,770
to to to audit now what what can you do

00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,570
if you're down around run only free

00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,970
software on your computer

00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,460
well they recommend the industry

00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:26,940
recommends you to install a micro code

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:31,850
patch that it will make your computer

00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:35,780
much slower like 30 percent slower even

00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:40,200
they even tried to forbid people from

00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:45,330
publishing benchmark results after the

00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:50,810
updates so you see how big of a hit that

00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:53,490
was and and you don't know what other

00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:56,730
undesirable features these updates might

00:37:53,490 --> 00:38:00,390
bring so think about that think about

00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:02,910
this possibility of not installing these

00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:06,630
updates keeping your computer fast and

00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:09,000
secure running only free software that

00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:14,310
you have audited or that someone you

00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:17,460
trust because you know even if you keep

00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:20,760
your machine passed there are other

00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:23,430
variants coming up we know that some

00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,550
people already know about that we know

00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:30,630
that they could be exploiting them

00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:32,900
we know that so why place yourself at

00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:39,240
risk why should you run around

00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:41,780
blindfolded it's dangerous you should

00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:49,170
understand the gravity of the situation

00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:52,140
and don't let big bad wolf in one US

00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:55,380
president once said that we have nothing

00:38:52,140 --> 00:39:02,730
to fear but fear itself so you might as

00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:05,790
well not fall for these threats and keep

00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:17,250
your machine free

00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:20,100
and say thank you very much we have like

00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:26,790
we have a few for example Christians

00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:28,560
they say my crew and I can run and if

00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:30,720
you don't have questions now I'll be

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,770
happy to answer than left rewards of

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:41,250
them until Tuesday and done this Tuesday

00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:43,590
at 1:30 the other one escaping this

00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:47,010
surveillance black hole with free mobile

00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:51,830
computing no questions

00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,830
I hope oh please

00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,150
I guess

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,410
it could be close um just to pick up in

00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:07,880
your last slide where the argument was

00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:11,420
that you shouldn't download the farmer

00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,339
updates free FSF has this huge thing

00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,579
about if it's a downloadable farmer

00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:19,160
update then it's bad and we ignore the

00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:21,769
fact that the codes already running

00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,959
anyway there's already firmware embedded

00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:26,929
in CPUs micro could already exists or

00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:29,299
not so the dichotomy of don't download

00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:31,939
the non-free firmware because that puts

00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:35,719
you at more risk opportunities advantage

00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:40,939
it's an unfair one you mentioned the PSP

00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:42,709
the entire me I know that arm how some

00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:45,019
embedded firmware stuff going on as well

00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:48,769
as low underneath us are there any

00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:50,869
decent processors these days that we can

00:40:48,769 --> 00:40:54,439
actually trust I mean even risk v as I

00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:58,189
understand that has some blobby bits in

00:40:54,439 --> 00:41:03,380
it and the ASIC implementations so is

00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:05,989
there any safe CPU to run that's an

00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,839
excellent question thank you for that so

00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:12,079
III see two parts in that one is the

00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:16,819
issue of whether the microcode in in the

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:19,339
cpu is any better than the microcode

00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:23,179
updates that he might load onto it and

00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:25,969
the other is is there any cpu that does

00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:27,920
not involve the trade-off is that is

00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:29,410
that a reasonable summary of your

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,289
question okay

00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:44,119
the letter I'm I'm very hopeful for a

00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:47,179
risk fine but I'm hopeful iiiii I don't

00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:51,019
know enough about hardware to tell you

00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:54,799
you can trust any of the line ly trust

00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:58,039
any of the known free CPUs that are out

00:41:54,799 --> 00:42:02,059
there it's really blind trust right to

00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:05,119
you if you cannot see the specs and if

00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:10,489
you cannot reproduce the build but it is

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:11,070
blind trust so I don't have a positive

00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:13,170
answer

00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:16,380
to the second part and unfortunately but

00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:23,580
I'm hopeful we're probably getting there

00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:27,650
very soon as for the first part free

00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:32,250
software is about ethics it's not about

00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:35,370
the technical aspects of the risks that

00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:39,600
are there but rather about whether it's

00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:43,650
it's ethically wrong for someone to

00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:46,560
deprive someone else of an essential

00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:52,640
freedom that is the key argument for a

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:56,310
free software know when you take a a

00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:01,050
microprocessor that has built in micro

00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:03,990
code that might as well be a harder

00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:06,720
circuit you don't know whether it's a

00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:10,470
harder circuit or a program that is

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:14,130
loaded on a non-volatile piece of memory

00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:16,950
or if it's burned on a permanent piece

00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:19,920
of memory you really don't know if the

00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:23,520
processor is a black box the fact is

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,270
that you need that that is one of the

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:32,550
components that go into the processor

00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:38,390
and as long as you know that it as long

00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:41,370
as you do not attempt to modify it you

00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:46,710
might as well take it as a piece of

00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:51,830
hardware it's indistinguishable and in

00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:56,850
that there is no there is no convincing

00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:59,540
ethical argument against one or the

00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:04,350
other practice they're both

00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:07,340
indistinguishable ethically speaking you

00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,340
don't agree with that

00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:16,300
the moment you actually modify that you

00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:20,260
make that visibly modifiable then it is

00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:24,880
evidently an attempt of defender to

00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:28,090
remove your freedom to modify that piece

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,660
that was made to modify the behavior of

00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:34,840
the computer so this is clearly

00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:39,100
unethical from the free software point

00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:47,410
of view now whether these are identical

00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:50,320
or indistinguishable from a technical

00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:55,660
aspect I totally agree with you we're

00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:59,760
much better off with only with with a

00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:02,830
CPU that did not have built-in secrets

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,770
there's no discussion about that but

00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:09,190
that is not the ethical issue the

00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:11,550
ethical issue is whether it's wrong to

00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:15,550
deprive the user from controlling

00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:20,010
software that runs their lives that runs

00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:23,320
their computing and when that piece is

00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:26,490
indistinguishable from Hardware setting

00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:29,800
a higher standard for that just because

00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:34,780
we know it it's not actually Hardware

00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:38,020
although he could be seized off so we

00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:40,240
don't do that that that is why we make

00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:43,540
this distinction that well the one that

00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,060
is there's fine sort of it's not

00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:51,460
ethically bad it's just undesirable

00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:54,490
whereas the replacement the update well

00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:57,190
you should rather not use it I hope that

00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:59,560
makes sense to any of you thank you so

00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:03,340
much we're out of time I understand so

00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:05,790
I'll be around I hope we can talk more

00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,790
about that

00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,590
[Applause]
