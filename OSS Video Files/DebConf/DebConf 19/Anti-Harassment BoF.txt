	00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:12,889
so welcome everybody to the

00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:17,860
anti-harassment team Boff I'm Steve we

00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:22,700
have Molly and Tina dialed in remotely

00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:24,680
if you do need to talk to them we'll see

00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,900
what we can do when we were testing this

00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,910
yesterday the audio didn't from the room

00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,860
did not work too well for them if it

00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:35,300
doesn't I can always forward questions

00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,680
and comments first things first we don't

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,600
want to call ourselves the anti Rassman

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,620
team anymore I kind of spoiled this with

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,829
a mail a few days ago we want to be the

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,140
community team names are important as

00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:51,440
I'm sure many people will hear will will

00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,380
appreciate anti-harassment is

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,290
immediately a negative way of describing

00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:00,590
things if the anti harassment team gets

00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:03,170
in touch with you that has negative

00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,089
connotations if the community team get

00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:09,530
in touch with you to help you you know

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:13,039
describe how to make a welcome Debian a

00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,499
welcoming community that hopefully has a

00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:20,509
slightly better way of you know has a

00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:22,459
better meaning so this is above please

00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:25,549
this is not just me

00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:27,499
and Molly and Tina spouting we want to

00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:31,700
hear your comment we want to hear your

00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:34,670
ideas too and we're going to quickly go

00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,099
through who we are we want to discuss a

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,749
little bit about what Debian wants from

00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:42,249
our team because this is a very

00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:45,679
important thing and then we do have our

00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:48,319
we have a proposed scope of what we

00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:50,359
think the team can do we want to

00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,700
obviously to try and sync up those two

00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:55,009
those two sets of ideas that's how

00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,409
that's how we're hoping to go here I

00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:00,139
have started a gobby doc for this if

00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:02,719
somebody or somebodies would be happy to

00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:05,419
put notes in there that would be awesome

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,340
I will do my usual thing that I do with

00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:09,619
the DEF CON session over I will send out

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,190
summaries of discussion to the list and

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:14,780
whatever later obviously we only have a

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,670
fairly small room

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,590
and we do want to make sure that

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:23,090
everybody in the project is kept abreast

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:25,490
of of what we spoken about so who are we

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:29,870
first of all we are a self-organized

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:35,120
team we are not delegated we currently

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:40,270
have three people hi I'm Steve if I do

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,270
that then Molly can wave say hi Molly

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,170
[Laughter]

00:02:45,880 --> 00:03:10,600
right I'm Tina do you want to say

00:02:48,170 --> 00:03:10,600
something yeah Tina you are very quiet

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:31,670
okay what do I hit f5 while hovering

00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:37,190
over the one window so it'll be back in

00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:40,549
a moment I hope so what does debian want

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:43,880
the community team to do here are some

00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:46,100
ideas that we've heard please expand on

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,799
these if you think that there were more

00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,230
things we should be doing we've had been

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,480
told that we should be helping to make

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,910
Debbie in a welcoming place we should

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,769
act as a point of contact for complaints

00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:03,590
and incidents we should be sub provided

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:07,370
Fe and events like debconf obviously we

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:10,450
should be helping people to understand

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:15,079
and work within the code of conduct and

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:21,169
what else this is the point where you

00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:24,009
guys talk maybe not all at once but

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:30,220
maybe one at once would be a good start

00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:35,000
in can we pass microphones around wait

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,120
do we have where do the mics go ah there

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,120
we go

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:45,530
so I think that I would like the HT

00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:48,500
support not just people running events

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:53,630
but also people who are running debian

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:55,759
services and who have to you know manage

00:04:53,630 --> 00:05:00,080
the the particularly communication

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,660
channels so like IRC mailing lists bug

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,030
system any other thing like that and to

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:29,210
support those people to help them make

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:32,630
Debian a welcoming place that's a very

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,729
good question I didn't imagine that the

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:38,630
aah team would be reading every bug

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:41,539
report to see if it was nice nor that it

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,460
was watching every IRC channel to see if

00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:44,780
it had some kind of incoherent ranting

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:50,389
in it because that would never happen on

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:52,099
IRC sure and and it is something that we

00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:55,430
need to work we need to agree on for

00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:57,860
scope obviously individual members of

00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,349
the a HT of the community team sorry

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,409
we'll be around and watching various bug

00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:05,900
reports various mailing lists whether

00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:07,820
it's all wiki pages or you know other

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,979
random places where there's discussion

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,960
and communication in Debian but

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:14,150
obviously we're not going to be

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,469
everywhere because we physically can't

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,759
be we know we'd you know they want

00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:21,740
enough hours in the day there aren't

00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:25,820
enough people what we've been doing so

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:31,090
far is mostly waiting on people to

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,090
report problems to us yeah

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,510
[Music]

00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:52,750
so you say report problems to you you

00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:54,819
say report problems to you some people

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,960
have said that this framing already sets

00:06:54,819 --> 00:07:00,669
things up to be awkward it might be

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,430
worth thinking about a neutral framing

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:06,009
where people just like you know bring

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,280
something to your attention sure or you

00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:11,199
know let you know about something give

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,840
you an opportunity to help in a

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,159
particular situation thank you that is a

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,099
better way of describing things so

00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:21,370
report incidents or or ask for help or

00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,870
or just generally you know pull us into

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,370
a conversation where they think we you

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,370
know we might have some good input

00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,479
obviously there were also places where

00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:35,469
we are going to be watching just because

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:38,080
you know weather coincidentally or just

00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:39,699
because we happen to be active in in the

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,740
right places whether it's you know the

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:46,210
development mailing lists or in the

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,279
common IRC channels we will all we have

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,440
been and will continue to be I'm sure

00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:54,069
proactive in cases where we think there

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:59,229
is a problem but that can cause issues

00:07:54,069 --> 00:08:01,210
too and I'll come on to those later does

00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,050
anybody else haven't have any ideas for

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,050
what we should be doing

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:25,330
Molly seems to be being blown away by

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:35,469
her fan very quiet maybe that's my fault

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:43,530
or is it yours at yours at you guys hey

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:52,540
I'm just making jokes over here word did

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:54,130
now there we go yeah okay this is

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,570
probably the point where i refreshed and

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,170
everything broke my fault

00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,970
at least I'll take the blame so we've

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:05,860
had discussions around

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:15,610
oh sorry Tina

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:21,970
ah I wasn't sure if you were wanting to

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:26,010
to add something there no no okay fine

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:32,880
so we've you know we've had the question

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:35,890
should we be trying to do mediation and

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,310
that's a difficult difficult thing to be

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:42,250
doing

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:43,990
eh in terms of the number of people you

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,640
know who we have in the team it gets

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,360
very difficult it's difficult to scale

00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,930
to be involved in every conversation

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:57,130
potentially and be there is a there is a

00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:59,080
worry that maybe volunteers doing

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,450
mediation without good training and

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,430
without good support may also be a

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:08,580
really bad thing to try it might not

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,580
help to people have thoughts about that

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,820
if you can come to the front that also

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:40,410
means that Molly and Tina get to hear

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:52,839
you through my microphone as well yeah

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:55,120
okay so I have a I have quite a strong

00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,790
opinion about mediation at least

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,620
mediation as it is generally understood

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,089
the word you know if you look at like

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,889
the Wikipedia definition or dictionary

00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:07,570
definition or definition that a lawyer

00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:12,070
might use mediation is facilitated

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:14,640
negotiation you help the two sides to

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:18,839
come to hopefully a mutually agreeable

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:24,160
compromise it does not address any

00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:26,320
questions of you know who was who has

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,640
more of the right of whatever is going

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:37,290
on it does not work to address any power

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:41,050
imbalances that may exist and generally

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:44,440
mediation works can work to even

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:47,920
entrench existing biases and existing

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,449
power structures because it's it's a way

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,019
where if you are already in the upper

00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:55,449
hand in some kind of situation the

00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:59,260
mediator will will explain very clearly

00:11:55,449 --> 00:12:02,079
to your interlocutor how bad it will be

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,709
for will for them if if they you know

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,940
can't come to a negotiated settlement

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:10,660
whereas for you if you are in the better

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,339
position the the mediator will find it

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,610
more difficult to persuade you to

00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:20,100
compromise I have engaged in mediation

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:23,920
as I suppose a mediate EE and I found it

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,019
I'm quite strong-willed as you all know

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,260
and I found it one of the most taxing

00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:30,730
experiences that I've ever had and I

00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,990
came under intense psychological

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,760
pressure to give up a thing that

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:40,660
ultimately a judge decided I was

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,690
entitled to so I am really not a fan of

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:48,279
mediation also mediation is tremendously

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:50,640
hard work for the mediator yeah so I

00:12:48,279 --> 00:13:19,600
know thank you

00:12:50,640 --> 00:13:21,790
okay so too much so there is some

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,070
overlap but yes most of what we're

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,170
looking at for here is between members

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:30,190
of the Debian community or in particular

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:33,970
maybe worse were someone has made a

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:36,699
mistake has or made repeated mistakes or

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,910
doesn't doesn't understand maybe how the

00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:42,279
tone of their argument or the the

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:47,620
arguments they're making fit into a

00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:49,839
welcoming community and that is can be

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,490
really quite nuanced it's not

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,610
necessarily something though that you

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,170
would consider mediation maybe although

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,510
I've heard people describe it as such

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,149
between one member of the community and

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:03,990
the rest of the community it's it's it's

00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,990
it's difficult

00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:21,139
yeah not is there anything else that we

00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:28,819
should be trying to do directly with it

00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:31,399
as the community team I'm not sure

00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:38,870
there's anything extra to add to that

00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:40,910
but how could we help you sure so you

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:45,110
might notice we're a small team to start

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:47,660
with at the very least we are not going

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,240
to be the only people who are trying to

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,759
make Debian a welcoming place what we

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,220
actually want is for the whole of the

00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,170
community to work to make Debian a

00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,949
welcoming place because that's how a

00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:05,240
community works with them as a backstop

00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:06,740
we will help when people need it but we

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,300
shouldn't we know we're not going to be

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,670
driving this we're going to be

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,019
supporting it and there is a big

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,290
difference though I hope people that

00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:18,439
people agree the other thing that we are

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:21,470
looking for is to grow the size of the

00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:24,860
team again there were only three of us

00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:28,309
and as you might have seen from a couple

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,769
of recent incidents say around Christmas

00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:33,949
last year when you only have a small

00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:37,759
team it can be very very wearing getting

00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:41,809
involved in personal processes like this

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:49,129
can be immensely draining what we would

00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:52,449
like to do is and in fact if I select

00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:52,449
that hit that

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:06,470
no I didn't learn apologies we are

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,220
looking for more team members yes

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:12,950
specifically okay as I said it does not

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:48,290
very much to that I did have two slides

00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:50,210
that we then decided not to go with but

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,560
there's also the question of like movie

00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:57,590
is someone we dealing with sensitive

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:59,330
information so I guess I want to express

00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,920
here is that if you're interested in

00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:06,860
joining the team and you're NER that

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:09,110
mean developer participation like you

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,930
don't have to commit to dealing with

00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:14,240
everything that's crazy all at once you

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,070
can try it out for a little bit that's

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,760
minimal to everyone sure

00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:22,550
so when we so we had to sprint a few

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,420
weeks back which I've sent out to sprint

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:28,850
report about a few days ago where we are

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,740
genuinely hoping to get to is not the

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,470
team of three we have maybe somewhere

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,960
between eight and twelve so we can get

00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,810
to the point where not everybody on the

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,000
team has to be always on duty not

00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:44,320
everybody has to be worrying about so

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,550
dealing with every incident we can have

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,790
sufficient people that we can set up

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:52,100
small subgroups say three or five

00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:54,350
deliberately forth with odd numbers if

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,820
anyone is thinking about this because

00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,360
there were lots and lots of good reasons

00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,480
for that

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,120
so we can consider cases we can provide

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,810
support without everybody having to be

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:08,660
always busy we are pondering about

00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,590
something like like the LT s team have

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,390
done were

00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,630
there will be one member of the team who

00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:17,360
will be the the point person for a week

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:22,130
or so and their job is to respond

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:26,480
rapidly to incoming reports and requests

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:29,360
for help so that people do get timely

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,030
responses and but that person's main job

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,510
will just be to pass on to a subgroup of

00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,130
the rest of the team and then just pass

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,530
things over

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:45,710
in more awkward cases we would be

00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:48,050
expecting there will be the option to

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:51,430
pass on to a larger portion of the team

00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:54,110
you know if there is a real problem and

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,000
someone wants to appeal things if

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,460
somebody really genuinely wants to get

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,770
more opinions there is of course scope

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,660
for that but we want to get to a size of

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,810
team where we can support Debian's needs

00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:08,720
without also burning out the people

00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:11,630
involved burnout has been a real problem

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,790
I know for previous members of the aah

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,460
team which is why we cycle through

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,760
people so quickly we want to be able to

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:22,240
get to the point where we can have

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,280
somebody coming in and working on this

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,050
without having to take all the stress

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,670
all the time because obviously that's no

00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,410
good for anyone you know there were a

00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:32,540
limited number of spoons to go around

00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:36,140
you know to borrow an Rico's normal

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:41,780
terminology and but we are genuinely

00:19:36,140 --> 00:20:01,100
looking for help we have had - sorry did

00:19:41,780 --> 00:20:04,780
somebody want to say something nope for

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:07,520
people to be able to yes not so long

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:11,150
he's my one people who stay for a long

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,280
long time and also his team is difficult

00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:16,370
to stay for a long time without getting

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:28,040
all your emotional energy

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:31,830
sure so my English is not so good so I

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:34,890
would a suggestion what else could you

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:39,170
do I think promote more talks about

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:43,020
privilege and about diversity

00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:47,820
in the conference and other space show

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:51,990
okay and I would love to help with this

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:55,140
show sure yes and people that are I'm

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:58,350
just like nearby the the Debian

00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:01,290
community you know approaching and these

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:04,170
people can be in the group too oh it's

00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:07,110
better like people that's writing the

00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:10,430
collectives or other people okay so

00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:15,840
that's have some very good questions so

00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:18,420
what we genuinely need unfortunately we

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,340
don't feel comfortable with having non

00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,900
Debian developers be part of the team

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:27,450
directly because of the privacy needs

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:32,190
though our genuine there are genuinely

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:34,560
going to be times okay though are

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,620
genuinely going to be times were privacy

00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:41,520
matters or private matters are going to

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,530
be discussed we implicitly trust members

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,230
members of the Debian project directly

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:50,010
to do to to you know to deal with that

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:51,720
correctly for non Debian developers or

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,030
you know non recognized Debian

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,790
contributors obviously there is more for

00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,320
problem four we are genuinely happy to

00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,340
take help on all kinds of other things

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,410
like you say so

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,720
discussions about diversity and

00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,120
privilege and general support because

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,690
it's it's a wide community and we all

00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,340
need to hear those the other piece that

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,910
we need to do okay sorry I'm Deanne

00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:18,810
waffling on is we also want to grow the

00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:21,120
team so we have more diverse experiences

00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,400
more diverse viewpoints so that we can

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,340
genuinely have more understanding of

00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,260
where people come from I mean he'll I am

00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,110
a rich white straight guy

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,810
from from Western Europe I take almost

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,750
every box on the privilege scale I try

00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:39,270
not to abuse it genuinely I think I'm a

00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:42,420
reasonable guy of course I do but I

00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:45,780
can't help but have some bias you know

00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:48,570
everybody does so so it's important to

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:52,110
us that we have good representation of

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:55,230
every community of every part of the

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:58,410
community it also inside the community

00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:01,760
team so we have the white experiences

00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,760
and the white backgrounds to draw

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:32,190
exactly exactly that and that's what we

00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,680
were hoping for is to have you know we

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:37,440
can have a purse or we can have a set of

00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,540
people doing doing the front end we can

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,120
have a set of people working for a month

00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,220
to support stuff and then taking a month

00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,780
off obviously we're going to need a lot

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:52,640
more people to make that happen and

00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:52,640
that's where we want to get to so I

00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,930
wanted to tag on what you said about

00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:03,540
sort of positive stuff and I was

00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:06,960
wondering if the change in the team name

00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:11,100
sort of reflected a desire to do more

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,810
sort of proactive stuff and I was

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,110
wondering if some of those things might

00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:18,600
be like teaching more people to get to

00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:21,870
folks a little earlier before it's been

00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,180
like you know for instance like 300

00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,250
posts on a mailing list or someone it's

00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:29,100
more like teaching the community in

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,630
general like hey here's how we call

00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,630
people in when they seem to be getting

00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:36,000
really staticky like and and we all know

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,830
how to do it so that it and you know

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,320
instead of 300 posts later we're like

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,750
now everyone is mad like

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,480
more folks feel empowered to kind of be

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,279
like Steve you're kind of extra today on

00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,320
the mailing list ringing in or something

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,630
like that absolutely that is where we

00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,509
want to get to we want to be have it to

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:57,659
be encouraging more members of our

00:24:54,509 --> 00:25:00,330
community to step up and help in exactly

00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:02,250
those situations and call on help if

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,559
they feel there is problem that there

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:07,259
are problems or feel that they need

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,210
extra support from the community team we

00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,880
want to make things welcoming

00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:14,009
immediately not be trying to clamp down

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:18,269
on a flame war that's already three

00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:24,120
weeks old definitely of course I would

00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:28,769
Molly yes I think just to be clear on

00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:32,490
things right now we're not interested in

00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:40,919
taking on responsibilities of like

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:42,720
serious response I'm just gonna kill the

00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,860
video from this end in case that hopes

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,990
helps yeah so I was just saying that I

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,669
think I speak for the team when I say

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:54,570
we're not interested in taking on

00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:58,470
serious education issues right now like

00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:01,820
we don't want to have to explain micro

00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:05,309
aggressions on a major proactive

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,659
community-wide basis but we are

00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:09,690
definitely interested in working with

00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:12,000
individuals when they have things come

00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,500
up and periodically sending reminders to

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,059
email lists especially during heated

00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:24,110
periods about like education related

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:24,110
issues sure

00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:36,210
so I have a question

00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:42,930
is he interested in I mean there are

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:45,990
situations maybe where some help is

00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:47,760
needed that are about you know somebody

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,670
just like behaving badly but we

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,190
sometimes have situations where maybe

00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,820
maintain there is and kind of being very

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,380
responsive or engaging constructively

00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,030
we've already got the you know mi a-team

00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,570
if somebody completely disappears but

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:05,550
you sometimes find I don't know all the

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,070
maintainer will do is nak you and they

00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:11,400
won't like help you to solve whatever

00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,080
your problem is is that is that too

00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,820
difficult problem is that too broad a

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,410
problem is that something you think

00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,300
that's probably too bored from where

00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:21,390
we're really thinking definitely for now

00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,460
and again it's it does a scaling issue

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:26,220
with the small team we really can't get

00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,140
into that we might do in future but it's

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,440
not all focused at least now front for

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,690
now

00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:45,210
I think that's fair to say Molly Tina

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:46,950
yeah okay thank you I have a question

00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:51,600
for the audience when there is a hollow

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:55,560
is there kind of a low yeah go for it

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,750
I'm curious what kind of powers if any

00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,940
do you think the community team should

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,280
have like what kinds of things do you

00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:09,410
think we should be able to do that would

00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:12,150
impact the rest of the project I'm

00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,980
hearing lots of inborn breaths around

00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,350
the room but no one really wants really

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:22,280
with us and of course will talk to us

00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:25,800
and gonna go know is coming forwards I

00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:28,230
can give an example if that helps I

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:31,200
can't see you raise your hands but like

00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,730
do you think for example perhaps there

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,470
might periodically some point

00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,210
hypothetically be a situation where

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,380
there's a blog people think should be

00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,490
removed

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,080
do you think that's the kind of thing

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,000
that the age team should take directly

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:52,610
into their hands like the community team

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:56,090
remember given me Ling is not everybody

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:59,540
has access to is that the community team

00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:01,730
may may not even have formal powers but

00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,400
it should be a group of experts that are

00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:06,920
listened to by the relevant people that

00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:11,060
ultimately take the decisions I think we

00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:13,970
didn't have to move our to shake our

00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:16,220
ways of working but the relevant people

00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:19,750
should know it should know I mean to

00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:23,390
listen to what you as a collegiate group

00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:25,720
suggest because though it's not a random

00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:30,830
developer suggestion but people

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:41,210
recognized by being a experts in the

00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:43,100
area okay but what about if the

00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,750
community team has decided that there

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,340
should be something to be deal with and

00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,690
then they go to the next team and

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,310
they're all on location and then they

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,140
takes two weeks and maybe something

00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:53,840
really bad is on the web or something

00:29:51,140 --> 00:30:00,110
shouldn't you be able to maybe really do

00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:04,580
something sure that's that's a very good

00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:06,830
point so sure or so in fact yeah what

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,180
happens if if everything's on fire there

00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,650
is an absolute you know there is

00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,030
something that needs fixing immediately

00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:15,860
we were talking about said at our sprint

00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:18,200
about making sure that we would have say

00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,640
emergency point to contact at least for

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,280
all of the relevant places whether

00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,950
that's less masters or planet admins or

00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,470
even FTP masters or something in or

00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:29,300
depending on how things are going so

00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:31,070
that we can deal with that without

00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,230
having to take matters into our own

00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:36,440
hands I think that's how we would like

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:38,810
to go so we don't end up having to do

00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,860
things directly ourselves form

00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:45,100
experiences recently it can it can be

00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,100
problematic

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,760
Daniel

00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:01,440
I think what would be really helpful is

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,530
if there is a kind of escalation letter

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,200
that you that you publicly describe so

00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:09,540
like you know the first time there's an

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,640
issue that you were made aware of it

00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:14,190
that you think you need to act upon you

00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,620
talk to the developer to the maintainer

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:20,760
in private kind of explain the issue

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:23,820
stuff like that show one point then you

00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,890
go and kind of make it more public like

00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:29,010
a warning on mailing list or something

00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,930
like that and a third level or fourth or

00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:34,770
fifth or six you know you're the experts

00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:37,800
I'm not maybe that you submit a request

00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:42,270
to list masters for a temporary

00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:44,670
disabling of that that account or 2d I

00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:46,680
am like you know there's some problem

00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,930
with this person you know we tried it

00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,330
but doesn't seem to be fit needs more

00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:53,760
severe type of warning timeout whatever

00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:56,220
I think the important thing is that this

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,500
is transparent so there is this list it

00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,500
is the same for everybody and when the

00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,330
list is triggered at least in the public

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,400
pieces it is it is made explicit it is

00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:07,860
like an email from you that says like

00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,410
this is your second warning

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,640
this is your second and final warning or

00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,010
something like this and everybody knows

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,370
who's kind of aware of the process you

00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:19,710
know this is where it's at and right so

00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,360
because that's unfairness that we I

00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,340
think in in in the past with the cases

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,970
that have been discussed at length the

00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,980
problem was it was completely hard to

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:31,140
see what is fair or not and then people

00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,910
came up and had kind of all these subtle

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,530
feelings and then it escalates from

00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,020
there so sheron's parentsí and that

00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:41,220
thing is I think the major the major

00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:43,460
thing okay Deb we've got another mic

00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,460
here

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,510
I wanted to add to that because I run a

00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:52,160
couple of other Melling lists that

00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:55,370
whatever the process is I'm very plus

00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:58,789
one on transparency you want a balance

00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:01,970
the stuff you're subjecting other people

00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:04,760
to with the whoever is on notice or

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,289
whatever we're calling it and I know

00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,419
there are other mailing lists that have

00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:10,880
an intermediate step where that person

00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:12,740
is posts in the mailing list have to be

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,120
moderated before they go to the rest of

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,880
the list so that might be one way to

00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,250
balance that so if someone has you know

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,900
two strikes and then it's like okay you

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,490
can still stay on the mailing list but

00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,559
someone looks at your posts before they

00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,080
go and do harm to the rest of the

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,260
community if it's fine it's innocuous

00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,880
you've got your blood down today cool if

00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,039
it's not then we're gonna say hey this

00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,870
is what we talked about so just kind of

00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:37,850
tagging on like that might be one of

00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,610
those steps in that transparent process

00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:42,409
yeah and coming up with that kind of

00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:44,179
process was exactly one thing that we

00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:48,590
spoke about at the team spent a few

00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:50,390
weeks back we won't of course genuinely

00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,919
the last thing we want to be doing is

00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,750
trying to scare people to the point

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,400
where they're not saying anything we

00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,799
don't want to be picking on people who

00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,919
use the old bad word or hole have a bad

00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:02,600
day and are frustrated and complain what

00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:04,820
we're trying to pick up on is the places

00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,789
where there is a genuine pattern of

00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,649
someone you know repeatedly clearly not

00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:12,500
we're not wanting to play by our rules

00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:14,300
not not wanting to be welcoming not

00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,820
following the code of conduct however

00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:19,159
you describe it and definitely we want

00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:24,500
to have a process where we will be able

00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:26,659
to keep to keep track of reports from

00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,879
people about put about to put about

00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:31,129
problems about failures like this and

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:34,340
then we can start actually picking up on

00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:37,310
the patterns if someone is occasionally

00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:40,690
being frustrated we all are we all know

00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:43,609
that if someone is repeatedly genuinely

00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:46,159
picking up or you know causing problems

00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:49,850
with their words with their actions we

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,609
will start by talking to them to say hey

00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:54,409
are you aware that you are really really

00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:57,060
annoying people you're you're making

00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:59,460
people three be frightened threatened

00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,370
offended whatever whatever the the need

00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,110
is if there is a continued pattern

00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:07,050
beyond that point that will be

00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:08,940
absolutely where we will we will start

00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:12,270
to share our concerns with the FTP

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,670
masters not necessarily in all the list

00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:17,040
masters or the planet people not

00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:19,830
immediately to say we recommend that you

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,990
do this but here are our concerns and

00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,850
here are the incidents that we have

00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:27,240
looked at here is a pattern that we are

00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:30,660
worried about we know we're not going to

00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,670
say please remove this person what we're

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,580
going to Det say is we think there are

00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,860
concerns here what do you think and then

00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,320
go from verse so we will then let the

00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,300
appropriate teams with the white powers

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,990
have the information they need at that

00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:49,680
point something I would like to really

00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:53,070
emphasize here is that the goal of the

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,500
team is not to punish people who just do

00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:57,210
something wrong once it's to help people

00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,130
like help the community be a more

00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,720
welcoming place and help people become

00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:04,080
more comfortable interacting with that

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,060
community with our community so we don't

00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,290
expect perfection we just expect people

00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:11,970
to try to do better I think this is the

00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,590
aspect that people have been asking like

00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,780
you know trying to educate people try to

00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,730
set examples try to tell people what is

00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,500
desired behavior which is much more

00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:21,390
important than just you know punish the

00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,210
single sure point of not desired

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,550
behavior but honestly I'd say it is

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:31,500
completely fair to go to the list master

00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:33,630
or do a DA em with a request because you

00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,220
know if you are doing this and if you

00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,500
are seriously working through a

00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,740
transparent and well laid out process

00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,600
then at the end you must have an opinion

00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,880
what a list master should be doing with

00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,980
this person as the next escalation level

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,230
and you may be having a typical

00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,420
recommendation of a one month timeout or

00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:54,030
so on the first case and six month on a

00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,490
second whatever so you know you make

00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:58,410
everybody else's life much easier if

00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,780
you're honest about it and say like you

00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,580
know please remove the person for a

00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,140
period of time please remove him and

00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:07,650
definitely please kick him out of the

00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:09,930
project because you're not kind of you

00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,619
know having all the know-how having all

00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,329
the background

00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,980
have all the tools and then you're

00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:15,960
saying like yeah but you know do

00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,730
something because then we get into the

00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,779
randomness thing again right I think the

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,579
other teams would really like a

00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:22,019
recommendation they will do checks and

00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,609
balance that's good right they build

00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:25,289
their own opinion and if they follow

00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,940
your recommendation then the action will

00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:28,920
take place and if not you get a feedback

00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,079
loop where you may have you know missed

00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,049
the step main on half had all

00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:41,160
information whatever sure did I say yes

00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:44,220
am positing up go for some so just as a

00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,170
point of information we have received at

00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:52,680
least from damn that they specifically

00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:55,109
do not want recommendations yeah other

00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,779
teams may want recommendations this is

00:37:55,109 --> 00:38:01,589
the kind of thing that over time as we

00:37:57,779 --> 00:38:05,249
get a better process here we may end up

00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:06,660
with a better feeling about how each of

00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,940
the other teams what they would like

00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,059
from us we definitely definitely want to

00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,910
make sure the very least we have a good

00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:16,829
record to show what a pattern of

00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,890
problems before we move on that kind of

00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:18,890
thing

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:36,029
I will I think that our goal main goal

00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:40,700
is to make the community more welcoming

00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:44,910
a show place to be and definitely

00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:49,890
punishing anybody is not a goal like

00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:53,099
it's a failure for us for a community

00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:56,119
for everybody like we don't want that we

00:38:53,099 --> 00:39:00,749
want to help people as much as possible

00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:04,460
but at the same time and I think our

00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:06,450
marasmus ability is to protect and the

00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:09,809
rest of the community is the most

00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:13,470
vulnerable in particularly and and so I

00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:16,019
think that's what informs what we do and

00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:20,039
and then we live and then we let all the

00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:20,550
teams that are separate from where hawea

00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,340
has

00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:27,250
so they can take a decision of what is

00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:37,960
the profit these phones show him with

00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:40,090
just our concern is - yeah I'd like to

00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:44,440
point out that we have only a few

00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:46,240
minutes left if I were home do we want

00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,410
to do some sort of wrap up or final

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,120
thoughts in if you have one thing to say

00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:55,030
please go one thing that I do want to

00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,880
say now I'm many of you will have known

00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,130
me a long time and I have always been

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,130
you know I have struggled with being

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:06,630
nice to people it's not something that

00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:08,590
comes naturally to me you know I I and

00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:12,070
I've been on the wrong end of the

00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:14,140
community team more than once and I

00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:17,380
would just like to thank the community

00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:20,590
team for the excellent way that they

00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:23,020
have dealt with me in those situations

00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:26,080
and they have really helped me improve

00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:28,630
I think they've helped Debian I'm

00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,550
perhaps in you know most of you probably

00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:33,070
helpfully won't have had that experience

00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,870
but it you know as somebody who was

00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:37,800
trying to work on this stuff I'm just

00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:43,810
really very impressed

00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:45,460
thank you and so yes you didn't see

00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:49,720
Molly making a heart symbol behind your

00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:53,020
back so moving on from this we do have

00:40:49,720 --> 00:41:01,330
as I said it can find where the pointers

00:40:53,020 --> 00:41:04,930
gone it's no it's not gonna work we we

00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:07,330
we have started work on a scope document

00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:09,340
of what we think we should be doing

00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:13,770
thank you everybody for the feedback

00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:16,270
today and the ideas there is clearly

00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:18,520
thankfully a massive overlap and a

00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,410
massive agreement between what we think

00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,230
is needed and what at least the people

00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:28,630
here think is needed we are going to be

00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:31,900
working with Sam and sending out that

00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:33,280
document very soon for well let's be

00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,020
honest to be beating up on the mailing

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,570
list and you know not not as the

00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:40,090
document and punch and pulled and pushed

00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:43,300
into shape and hopefully get to a point

00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:45,130
where we can get a good project buy-in

00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:48,220
because we know that there have been

00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:49,720
problems in the past were not everybody

00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,910
agrees with what we're doing or what

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,890
we're trying to do clearly we want to

00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:57,180
improve on that while we're trying to

00:41:53,890 --> 00:42:00,040
improve the feel of the Debian community

00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:02,530
