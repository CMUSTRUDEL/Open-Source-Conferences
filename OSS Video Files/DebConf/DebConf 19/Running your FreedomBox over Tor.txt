The FreedomBox blend of Debian offers people the chance to run a suite of personal web services free from the control of third parties ... but it does still require a traditional Internet connection, complete with all of the privacy and anonymity concerns that entails. That caveat disappears, however, if the FreedomBox has the Tor network as its only connection to the outside world. Entirely by chance, I found myself cut off from own public FreedomBox machine last year, but I soon discovered that Tor-only access has some distinct advantages.

This talk will describe my personal experience installing and running a FreedomBox installation that is accessible only over Tor. Some of the difficulties found in combining FreedomBox and Tor are easily overcome, such as properly configuring multiple Tor hidden ".onion" services and securely distributing cryptographic key material. Other hurdles, however, point to weak points that users would be unwise to fiddle with, such as using long-term cookies with Tor Browser.

The talk will describe the challenges and shortcomings encountered in depth — including Tor hidden-service management en masse, working with Let's Encrypt, key management, service persistence, remote monitoring, and mobile-device access. It will offer suggestions for expanding what packages FreedomBox offers, and will detail the configuration and preference settings required to use Tor Browser and Tor for Android with essential services.

Whatever the obstacles, however, audience members will see that it is possible to not only combine the user freedom of FreedomBox with the anonymity of the Tor network, but to come away with a stronger system when the two work in concert.

	00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:12,590
everybody for the first talk of the day

00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:16,160
after cheese and wine party so we

00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:19,310
welcome mater Willy's she will he he

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,509
will talk about how you can use

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:26,599
freedombox

00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:28,070
a over tor browser welcome thanks you're

00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:37,659
all very brave for getting up this

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:39,790
morning make sure I can do this yeah

00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:46,250
okay

00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:50,479
yeah like the like the saying goes I'm

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,430
gonna talk about freedom box and tour if

00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,920
you don't know me my name is Nate and

00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,900
I'm currently a PhD student so I work on

00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,820
font things on automatic spacing and

00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,769
kerning and stuff like that and I have a

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,710
freedom box that I can only access over

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:05,990
tor that's an important distinction that

00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,580
will come back up later and I know if

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,859
you're not clear on exactly what all

00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,509
that means or maybe you've just randomly

00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:14,420
stumbled across this video you're sure

00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:16,520
now I'll be really brief freedom box is

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,939
a debian blend that offers a suite of

00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,710
internet services you can install where

00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:23,840
you're in control of those rather than

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,490
some corporation offering the service

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,990
because it runs on your own machine and

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:33,409
pour is a vast virtual network that

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,840
offers guarantees about anonymity and

00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,030
privacy and traceability while still

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,799
letting you access the real internet and

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:44,240
there's more to that as well but it'll

00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:46,700
come up I do want to be affronts though

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,369
that this is definitely a here's what

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,380
I've tried tog this is not I'm not an

00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:54,649
engineer or assisted men really except

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,179
when I'm forced to be so you know there

00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:58,009
will be things that I'll probably get a

00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,630
little wrong and that's that's in the

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:02,079
spirit of making mistakes in public

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:06,439
we're just gonna proceed with that I'm

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,729
also happy to take questions at the end

00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,429
I'm gonna try and be really short

00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:12,080
because I unwisely proposed to talks and

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,730
the next one I'm giving starts

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,500
immediately after this one but in a

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,750
different place so we can't go along

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,730
and finally just this will come up

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,590
almost immediately but I like making

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,700
diagrams that mean nothing but look

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,040
pretty so you're gonna see a lot of

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,710
those and just ignore all the diagrams

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,360
and just focus on focus on the words I

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,680
know you think I'm kidding about that

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,270
but I'm not so how did we get here it

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,810
was kind of a convergence of some

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:43,950
unrelated things like I mentioned I

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,200
moved to start a PhD that was in January

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,610
it was in a different country since

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,600
that's not permanent I didn't take

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,810
everything with me and I kept a server

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,910
box back in the old country

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,709
originally I was planning on just using

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,100
it for things like off-site backup and

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:04,350
stuff like that but I also wanted to

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,450
install freaking box on it because there

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,160
were packages that were of interest to

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,080
me and I was interested in working with

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,660
the web admin interface and some things

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,760
like that and in particular freedombox

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,060
was my choice compared to things like

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,550
own cloud or next cloud because this

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,519
machine I put it on was already bun -

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:26,160
LTS machine and that meant I knew that I

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,190
could work with any package available to

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,110
me already whereas my impression of some

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,320
of those other competing services has

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,260
always been that you get their ecosystem

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,930
of we've built our own collaborative

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,630
text editor as part of next cloud and I

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,470
wasn't interested in having to relearn

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,350
that sort of thing

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,230
so I had all of this set up it was gonna

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,739
be in a specific location in the US

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,560
before I moved I had Open VPN running on

00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:58,049
a little pocket open wrt router and I

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,600
had open setup on the router I was

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,850
taking with me and I even had dynamic

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,019
DNS names set up so that I could access

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:09,030
this stuff elsewhere if I needed to and

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,709
I could get into the routers and

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,709
configure them that was all great

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,350
about four days before leaving location

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,850
a false part on me doesn't really matter

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,220
why the point is four days it's not a

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,500
lot of time to redo all this stuff so

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,850
the back-up plan was to just move it to

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,090
a different place like a family member's

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,300
house but in the time I had left I

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,640
actually couldn't figure out all of the

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,950
router and LAN and cable company modem

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,540
configuration needed it was over

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,420
hardware and wasn't like at the abscissa

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,640
T we supposedly had the admin password

00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,310
but it didn't actually work anyway not a

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,560
lot of time so the final plan was just

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,480
make sure I could get into SSH over tor

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,880
which I could and then worry about it

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,340
later i reconfigured the window brt

00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,590
router to act as a Wi-Fi clients to join

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,270
the local network there and then I went

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,540
to the airport and honestly I thought

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,640
that I would ssh in over tor which i had

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,680
working already and then figure out the

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,430
land issues and be back in business as

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:17,180
pretty visual plan but i got busy and

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,890
you know how it is playing around with

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,800
it I discovered it actually wasn't bad

00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:25,130
accessing machine only over tor tor

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,169
browser let me get into the plinth

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:30,260
interface and things like that so I

00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:31,550
decided to keep it around and like it

00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,880
might be an interesting use case to

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,340
explore but it actually works more or

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,540
less and I can tell you that it works

00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,880
well enough that I would encourage you

00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,419
to try it if you are doing freedombox

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,419
things yourself

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,930
there's a few distinct dimensions to a

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,160
little report I'm going to give on the

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,660
subject some general how to's about some

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,880
things you need to do

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,330
so what works what doesn't I'm also

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,860
going to talk about the usability of

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:06,090
using tor is your only access to a

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,090
service in the long term and maybe it at

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,200
the end I can get into some things where

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,300
what it's like getting outside of the

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,340
freedombox playground and what that may

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,430
be you can tell us about what we should

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,620
install by default in freedombox because

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,930
it's almost inevitable that whatever set

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,680
of modules are included in something

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,420
like freedombox

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,500
real world use our chicken to find

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,650
something they want to install

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:32,540
themselves to so making those play well

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:34,590
together seems important all right so

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,810
I'm not going to talk about all these

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,770
services that gets pretty repetitive but

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,780
I wanted to give you an overview of

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,030
exactly what I'm doing with this machine

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,090
and I'll talk a little bit about why I

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:47,430
don't use some other modules maybe

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,360
because what specifically you run on

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,980
your freedombox

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,350
is going to vary a lot people have

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,240
different needs and they also different

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,460
motivations for using something like

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,580
this as opposed to using commercial

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,800
services for example maybe there's a

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,450
service that you can't find it's not

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,670
available in your country or it doesn't

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,490
quite offer the feature you need or is

00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:11,430
it more about trying to get away from

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,410
having your personal information reside

00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,940
with an app driven service those are

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,530
very different use cases and they're

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,960
gonna influence how well things work

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,210
this little set the bullet points there

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,240
are things that are offered in the main

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,680
freedom box at least as of the LTS a

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,320
bunch of releases that I'm using which I

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,550
realize is a bit old now things to the

00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,100
bottom we're just other stuff that I've

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,010
used if you pat your calc you probably

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,770
are familiar with those are just online

00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:45,690
office online office document editing

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:48,000
things tbh is a DVR ever use it open so

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,710
speedy are they're all terrible but

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,330
there are terrible different ways I can

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,780
say that because I battled with mythtv

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:57,000
for a decade but one of the ways mythtv

00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,270
is terrible is it you can't administer

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,080
it without a GUI like it's a GUI

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:06,479
interface just to set it up th at least

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,150
you can run that

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,320
Gregg is a podcast aggregator so anyway

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,090
the other important thing I really want

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,699
to emphasize here is that this

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,310
configuration which I described is that

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,740
the machine is at a relative's house and

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,080
then I only access it through tor that's

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,790
important because this is tore out and

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,220
it has a perfectly working internet

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,449
connection in you could look at the

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,150
whole thing from the other perspective

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:36,839
which is what if the machine itself can

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,979
only access the internet over tor you

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,450
would have different setup questions

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,870
there I'm not prepared to answer those

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:48,450
because I haven't tried it and for now

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:49,830
this I think is use case to consider so

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,800
first of all let's start with the easy

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,450
stuff it's right there

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,850
top of the list if you look at the

00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:00,029
plinth web interface for freedombox is a

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,800
network tor and it might not be obvious

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:03,120
what you can do here because there's a

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,630
lot of different things that toward us

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,310
right you can run a tor node you can use

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,600
tor to access the internet things like

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,160
that but one of the things that the

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,690
plinth module lets you do is set up a

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,830
hidden service and that's the key to

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:19,310
accessing it from the Tor network when

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:22,680
you turn it on you get this simple

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:27,209
checkbox enable tor and then down at the

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,610
bottom hey that works 14 service it also

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:32,700
tells you that it's running and what

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,400
port is listening on now the weight or

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,490
services work hidden services is they

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:42,630
just remap a connection from one TCP

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:49,500
port a local host to a service that

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:51,420
faces toward and tor only when you set

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,730
it up you get this gibberish address it

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,010
some done onion the gibberish part of

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,770
that is a public key when the service

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,170
starts up it sends that out to some

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:05,240
random tor nodes in the network that

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:07,200
will be its introduction points and then

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,180
it writes down the name of the

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,100
introduction points signs it with the

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,260
private pair for the public key and

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,750
uploads that to the distributed hashtag

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,590
or on tour which means that when you try

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,040
and connect as a user

00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:23,110
you know it gets looked up on the

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,270
distributed hash and then you get

00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:28,120
pointed to one of those intro points and

00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:30,390
the tour circuit is made now some

00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,580
details here that are important are that

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:36,300
that URL is how you get a symmetric

00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:40,839
encryption so you don't actually need to

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:42,640
necessarily rely on SSL TLS and it also

00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,710
means that the introduction points and

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,380
the nodes along your tor circuit can't

00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:51,089
snoop on the connection but that's not a

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:55,180
panacea and now in theory any app module

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:57,160
that you can access underneath length

00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,020
has a subdirectory you can access

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,130
through the torrent service that runs

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:06,060
with just that checkbox set up as it

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:08,470
turns out that's not entirely true and

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,450
the less easy part of course is that if

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,820
you've got something that doesn't run

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,700
under that as a subdirectory under that

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,860
main Apache instance then you have to do

00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,700
something separate like set up another

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,050
torian's Tory hit service and and of

00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,850
course there are other app modules that

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,880
don't get to use at all either because

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:30,790
they don't speak HTTP or because they

00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,100
speak it on a different port and a

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:36,330
couple of examples there I'm not a Mayan

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:39,490
test person I have user ed of kale and

00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:42,400
Tahoe the chat clients again are gonna

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,170
be possibly different protocols possibly

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,970
just different ports but you don't get

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,580
them for free been doing the hidden

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:51,670
service up luckily you can create other

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:54,430
onion hidden services and it's a pretty

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,230
straightforward process the caveat is

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,490
that the docs you find when you search

00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,950
for how to do this for how to run

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,200
multiple hidden services are incorrect

00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,700
that's for a website or at the very

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,020
least they're not set up the way

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,100
freedombox is set up and in particular

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:15,430
I'll just show you how you'd actually do

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:18,250
it for commands freedombox runs multiple

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,790
tour instances which are each configured

00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,280
with their own system these service

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,440
and there is this command tour instance

00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,350
create which generates the service file

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,960
and generates a little skeleton tour RC

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,120
file so you run that once with the name

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,570
of your service and then you get to edit

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,600
the tour RC file in theory you just need

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:42,830
to specify a directory for the target

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,050
and service plumbing which is in ver Lib

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:48,080
and then you you say what port it is

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,020
that you want to redirect so the port

00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,550
attached to 127

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,650
da-da-da-dah one is what's actually

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,690
running the service and then your gonna

00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,750
redirect it to port 80 so you can use it

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,490
through a web browser and then you start

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,040
it up and when you start it up with

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:07,610
system control it automatically

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,200
generates the key pair and plops the key

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,590
pair that you need as the onion address

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,150
into this hostname file so I've done

00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,760
this a lot I currently have six or seven

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:19,010
services running on the machine it's

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,540
it's kind of in flux because I tend to

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,010
test out applications and then ditch

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,230
them when I find something I don't like

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:28,840
about it for since I still haven't found

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:30,980
a really good like note-taking app but

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,020
there are other issues even if you're

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,140
not gonna just set them up and destroy

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,610
them practically speaking and winning a

00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,490
lot of portent services means you have a

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,380
lot of those onion addresses which is a

00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,470
kind of usability issue you can't

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,490
memorize that many so you have to

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:50,050
distribute them to the machines you're

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,050
using access which is not always easy

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:58,190
there are also issues that you'll run su

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,750
with picking a random non freedombox

00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,930
package and trying to set it up this way

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:05,990
for one thing apparently a lot of people

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,490
doing web development these days have

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,190
things that break if they're not running

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,720
up the web routes and I'm told this is

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,460
because of the popularity of something

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,670
called docker which I have not had to

00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,320
use necessarily but regardless you'll

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:21,890
have to jump through hoops in order to

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,260
do fix that the second thing is that a

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:28,310
lot of applications aren't necessarily

00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:30,139
going to use TLS and you know in theory

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,439
you have that built-in encryption with a

00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:35,720
portent service but you just shouldn't

00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:37,939
always trust the network and a

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,600
particular towards a high-value target

00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:44,079
so I would recommend trying to set up

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,360
TLS for every service that you run your

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,889
freedom box and if it just doesn't work

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,040
then you have to do something like set

00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:55,629
up a reverse proxy which I've had to do

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,709
once I think it did that for 40 beheaded

00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:59,389
another thing is that there are a lot of

00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:01,129
applications that are just designed to

00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:03,079
not support user accounts which is

00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:06,110
another level of getting security rights

00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:10,249
that could be by design like etherpad is

00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,389
designed to anyone can set up they need

00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:13,639
document they want that's sort of the

00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:15,499
point but that could be an accent like

00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,269
some of the note-taking apps I've seen

00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:19,279
were just a little too experimental and

00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:22,309
didn't really have that level of user

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,050
security that divergence between the

00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:26,149
tour Docs and in reality is a much

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,860
tougher thing I remember that I saw

00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,959
where the Tor project was looking to

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,240
hire a documentation person I don't

00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:35,180
recall whether I saw that they had done

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,399
that but it's really hard to find

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,290
details on which options in tor RC are

00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,120
gonna conflict when you have multiple

00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,970
torrents this is running in practice

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,920
usually what I do is just go back to the

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,660
plinth file and just jostle the port

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,040
numbers a little bit to make them all

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,750
work there also caveats you need to

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,259
understand just sort of generally

00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:00,439
running tor the first and foremost is

00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:01,970
that many networks blocked or this is

00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:04,699
not just if you're living in some

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:07,069
repressive nation state where they hate

00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:09,439
freedom you can get cut off from your

00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:11,000
freedom box if you just go to say a

00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:14,240
university network where they happen to

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,649
blocked or it's also it's gonna be

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,540
harder to debug when something goes

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:20,649
wrong if tor is your only entry point

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,699
I've had that a few times where I

00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:24,079
couldn't figure out what could have gone

00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:25,670
wrong and just eventually had to send an

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,199
email to someone and ask them to reboot

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:33,379
the machine another thing is that you

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:35,360
when you when you set up applications

00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:37,339
like client applications to use tor you

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,370
frequently have to use the socks proxy

00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,900
which I'll get to in a second

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,020
and a socks proxy doesn't have an easy

00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,220
way to check whether it's working or not

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:48,280
if you're using the browser there's

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,720
check dot or project org where you can

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,580
see if your tour condition is working

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,480
basically you socks or any other

00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,250
application that's not due to the

00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,930
browser it's a lot harder to figure out

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,820
if something that's gone wrong or

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,410
there's a tour issue or not and the last

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,190
thing is that toward definitely adds

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,240
overhead you know I get to in a bit if

00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,770
you want to access things over your

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,020
mobile data connection you need to worry

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,060
about that but for now let's talk

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:16,300
usability for the web application it's

00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,340
in particular so the first thing to

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,140
realize and again the diagram means

00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,570
nothing here but you only have one

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,730
choice of browser and that's tor browser

00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:25,990
so if you don't like Firefox because tor

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,550
browser is a derivative of Firefox

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,740
you're out of luck I mean hypothetically

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,080
you could proxy some other browser over

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,430
tor but you don't want to do that if you

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,950
read the early snows for tor browser

00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:40,410
which I do the sheer number of leaks

00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,410
that they plug is astonishing and scary

00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,840
the other thing is that you have to deal

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,850
with these scary certificate warnings

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,230
I'm talking about this thing it rather

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,020
rudely suggests I've done something

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:58,900
wrong here and not set up my website

00:17:53,020 --> 00:18:00,370
correctly but you if you use TLS you

00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,000
probably don't want to use self-signed

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:06,970
certificates because remember as they as

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,160
I said that tor onion address that's not

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,770
part of DNS it can't be part of units

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,710
because it's actually a key right and

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:18,040
the issue is that you can't get CA

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:21,340
signature on an onion domain so even if

00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,990
you were to set up let's encrypt or

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,850
something with the TLS certificate for

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,200
some domain you control when you're

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,150
using tor browser you're going through

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,980
the onion address which means the names

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,200
don't match so you are gonna get this

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,560
warning no matter what you get something

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:38,410
like after awhile increasingly annoying

00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,700
because you can save an exception when

00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,740
you see it but you can't save it

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,720
permanently in tor browser so it's every

00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:49,180
time along those same lines your

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,000
sessions your logins will expire in tor

00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,090
browser in theory a tor circuit can stay

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,540
alive as long as

00:18:53,090 --> 00:19:00,050
active in in the browser case this

00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:02,050
depends on how the web web application

00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:04,520
is set up whether it's keeping the

00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:07,310
session alive or not but even if it's

00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,950
supposed to suspend your machine the

00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:11,540
circuit is broken if a node that you're

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,210
using somewhere in that torture it goes

00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,500
down temporarily the circuit is broken

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,230
and if you're just idle too long you can

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,540
get disconnected network reasons is that

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,640
your control regardless every time you

00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,770
start up you have to login to everything

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,510
again and at this point I'm talking

00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:31,880
about logging into freedombox and the

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:32,510
applications themselves here again for

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,910
browser

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,110
you can't save usernames and passwords

00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:38,000
there are some hacky ways to get around

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:40,790
that but it's a warranty voiding thing

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,470
and really I'm just pointing this out as

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:46,100
a staying at the usability level this

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,780
will irritate you to do all day long you

00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,550
also can't use things like Firefox Sync

00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,060
so if you have a dozen

00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:54,550
onion domains you have to add them in

00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:58,880
separately this is an actual screenshot

00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:00,710
my tor browser so yeah I bookmark those

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,560
things it's kind of nice it's like

00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,910
having a little tour but to use it on

00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,050
multiple machines I have to manually

00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:11,060
copy those addresses around somehow the

00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,520
other thing is that tor browser is very

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,410
tight about add-ons technically you can

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,970
install add-ons but you're really not

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,430
supposed to and they make it extremely

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,170
clear and that's wise because add-ons

00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,510
can do a lot of stuff on their own they

00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,580
get in the way

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,440
TTR SS the feed reader is probably the

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,300
thing I use the most on the screen box

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,580
and it would really be nice to use

00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,820
something like Zotero which is a

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,410
bibliographic tracking thing and comes

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,140
with the plugin for Firefox but that

00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:41,120
would be a huge anonymity issue and it

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,870
wouldn't go away if I was using tor

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,550
browser for some other reason so it's

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,600
sort of an all-or-nothing situation with

00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:51,440
modifying tor browser

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,570
I said he's like restoring the tabs from

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,590
previous session that are disabled into

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:59,669
a razor

00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,960
for some reason favicons and broken for

00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:03,210
me quite a few times I'm not sure if

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,440
that's just a way the request is phrased

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:10,019
thing or what but and finally HTTP basic

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,330
authentication which is what you see an

00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:15,419
application that's not doing TLS but

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:18,539
just ask like this that's actually a bad

00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:20,279
example my my point here was that this

00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:22,289
authentication page generally does not

00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,720
show you the name of the site it just

00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:26,129
shows you this on memorizing bol onion

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,360
address although in this case I a

00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:30,720
screenshot at the wrong one because

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,249
reticule does tell you what it is but if

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,289
you just see that the gibberish address

00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,869
and you have to remember which one that

00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:39,210
goes with you've got a modal window

00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:41,490
blocking your ability to see what your

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:44,519
bookmark is there okay so there's some

00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,889
workarounds you could in theory copy or

00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,240
save logins from another Firefox profile

00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,610
you can definitely do that with

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,039
bookmarks it's pretty easy you can run

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:55,499
several four browsers

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,539
down load up the different locations use

00:21:55,499 --> 00:22:00,240
one for freedombox use one for accessing

00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:02,389
the Internet at large it's actually

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,039
possible to override these certificates

00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:08,309
exceptions lists there's a description

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:11,460
at that link about what it contains it's

00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:13,379
not like obfuscated or anything and

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,269
there you could just install a bunch of

00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:17,490
extensions and not care about the

00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:19,139
implications I'm not saying these are

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,330
insurmountable challenges I'm just

00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:23,009
saying that these are things that make

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,929
the experience a bit less pleasant I

00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,549
need to watch out personally I think

00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:29,639
adding all this work arounds just makes

00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:31,379
it more convoluted and probably isn't

00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:35,460
worth the effort considering that

00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:37,080
there's risks okay moving on tor browser

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,259
is your interface for all those web

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,619
services onion hidden services are your

00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:45,990
connection to the web and to certain on

00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:48,149
web service endpoints because you can

00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,970
actually set up that service like you do

00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:54,119
with SSH to support any other protocol

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:56,269
or TCP port that you need to but in

00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,190
reality you need to do more than that

00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:02,159
because you have to use client

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,410
applications for things and freedom and

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,300
freedom box as

00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:08,480
a lot of services to do this there is

00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:12,400
this horrified command line app that you

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,440
can use to launch foo or anything else

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,090
what that actually does is it's a

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:23,090
wrapper around tor socks which is a

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:27,110
socks5 proxy it also handles DNS so

00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:29,210
you're not going to leak lookups that's

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,370
not always perfect that everything

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,070
survives being run over a socks proxy

00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,950
without its knowledge applications can

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:40,190
get too clever for their own good and

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:42,260
break down when they try and I don't

00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,970
make requests or parse domain names and

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,780
don't understand onion addresses that

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,980
sort of thing it's it's not every app

00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,810
you have this issue if there are a lot

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,210
of apps that have proxy support built-in

00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:56,360
it feels like less of those and there

00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,520
used to be so you find one great your

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,740
problem is solved you also need to

00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,380
realize though that toward does not

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:06,410
support UDP it would mean read

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,060
architecture entire tor network so if

00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:11,900
you want to do that you can tunnel it

00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:14,720
over SSH outside of Tor I haven't tried

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,770
that it's significantly more work the

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,450
reason I haven't tried it as I haven't

00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:22,880
tried to use it let's look at an example

00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:26,420
of something that gets outside tor

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,150
browser and uses vow to kill this is a

00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:32,480
web dev based client and the calendaring

00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:37,760
application so CalDAV and carddav are

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:40,520
the standards technically the difficulty

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,710
with reticule is well I'm not sure how

00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:46,130
to classify this but there is an HTTP

00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:48,500
HTTP front-end but it's the web DAF API

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:51,230
endpoint it's not a web application that

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,000
you can use to set up your calendar it's

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:56,780
also interesting to note the freedombox

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,970
Doc's say that the reticule endpoint is

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,800
accessible underneath plinth but it

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,720
actually runs on its report I'm not sure

00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,090
if something happened that's unique to

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,740
my machine but regardless you need to

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,960
find a client application to actually

00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,870
use it to create a new calendar if you

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,030
want more than one

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:16,340
to create your events to modify them to

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:18,720
create contacts that sort of thing so

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,880
lightning is generally the answer on a

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,680
desktop machine or something like CalDAV

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,780
it's not so easy here though because

00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,790
lightning is tied in to Thunderbird and

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,620
if you want under bird to use tor

00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:31,860
there's a extension for the heck hole

00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,120
for birdie I never found a combination

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,190
of settings I would actually get that to

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,870
work toward birdie is fine you can test

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,030
that my suspicion is that lightning is

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,430
doing something too clever when it

00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,360
shouldn't

00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,610
lightning doesn't get as much attention

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,940
to something like Firefox so I'm not

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:50,130
trying to criticize them whether it's

00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,470
lightning being too clever about the

00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,559
URLs or what you never actually connect

00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:58,140
to the Davin point there there's other

00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:01,470
possibilities for the what the issue is

00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,000
maybe tor birdie is not actually proxy

00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:07,710
I have correctly it's designed to handle

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,750
SMTP IMAP so I don't know I gave up I

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,280
honestly never really liked user

00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,370
interfaces you guy with lightning so I

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,170
moved on you could say ok what about

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,730
gnome calendar this is a lightweight

00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,470
application it doesn't have all the

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,990
baggage of having a built in web browser

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,700
and that sort of thing thing is no

00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,640
calendar actually uses evolution data

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,900
services to get its calendars so if you

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,580
want to tour fine normal calendar you

00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,460
have to also tour Phi 80s for the

00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:36,540
calendar comes from EDS actually gets

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:40,110
its counter accounts through normal

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,370
online accounts and those two lower

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,440
level services are definitely not

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:46,230
expecting to have to deal with onion

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,230
domains it might be a different story if

00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:54,630
you're using tor as a system-wide VPN I

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:56,970
don't know and it's also possible that

00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:59,070
you just run into issues with tor Phi

00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,240
itself because it what it does is making

00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,450
best guess when launching the

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,450
application and so socks is fine for

00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,679
some things but maybe just throwing too

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,840
many different protocols I don't know

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,130
once it's gonna crash it regardless

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,320
ultimately horrifying a lower level

00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,490
system service like EDS and gnome online

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,440
accounts is a bad idea

00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,980
because it will break other things on

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,669
the system

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,899
just know what you want eventually what

00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:26,669
what I did this is just a couple of

00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:29,220
weeks ago is Astrid working with in

00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:33,179
cloud which is a web front-end to write

00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:35,909
a kill and I haven't like partially

00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:38,700
working there's a lot of assumptions in

00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:42,710
the code about whether the the dev

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,710
server lives on the same machine as the

00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:47,460
in floud a platoon of

00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:48,720
and it has protections in place against

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,630
cross-site scripting and things like

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,100
that that makes it hard to do when it's

00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,480
actually on the same machine but it has

00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,750
two different addresses and they're both

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,970
dot minion addresses and some of this is

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,080
stuff that you can you can figure out on

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,169
the backend but some of these

00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,559
assumptions are hard-coded into the

00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:09,029
front-end JavaScript stuff so I'm not

00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,730
recommending you do that yet but I think

00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:14,789
that's probably the best way forward in

00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,200
reality there's a much easier solution

00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:21,840
for mobile which I'll get to in a minute

00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,490
or two different example IRC bouncers RC

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,750
redirection points so they stay logged

00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,230
in for you

00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:30,450
I've tried both znc and Casso on this

00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:33,000
either one has Sox support built in at

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:37,500
least on the versions I've been able to

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,200
found you also have to then deal with

00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,970
the IRC client issue and there's a

00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,539
varying support for things like

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:47,580
self-signed certificates want to use a

00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:49,889
TLS certificate generally sometimes the

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:53,460
IRC network also mandates that you have

00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:59,789
different kind of certificate like free

00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:01,980
node uses sasl sasol i guess and you

00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:05,220
will have a hard time probably getting

00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,889
all of those certificates layered on top

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,370
of each other in a way that it works

00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:14,610
also have to worry about the clients

00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:16,950
clients can be really smart and decide

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:19,080
that you've been disconnected pool areas

00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,269
is the worst in my opinion about that it

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,820
never disconnects you I guess for some

00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:25,740
reason it destroys its trust memory of

00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,750
their certificates so then when it

00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,279
reconnects you then have to re add

00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,179
exceptions to all the self-signed

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,179
certificates and things

00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,580
honestly I'm not sure it's worth it for

00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:39,559
me to have I can use IRC on a local

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,830
machine I like the idea of having the

00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:44,870
bouncer stay logged into for me but I

00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:47,570
haven't reached we just happiness there

00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:51,140
the point is really just that this is a

00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:53,299
different sort of set of worry than you

00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:56,000
have with the web applications anyway

00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:59,150
moving on and at least sunny Android

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,980
there's a some nicer stories than the

00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,200
desktop client applications so I'll talk

00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,730
about that now you do have tor browser

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,580
for Android it's essentially the same

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,530
it's on the desktop so that's good you

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,289
can bookmark you can't save logins that

00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:14,900
sort of thing there's an app called or

00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:19,640
bot which can act uh Storify and allows

00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:22,010
you to selectively tag apps as always

00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,870
using more but it's a preference that

00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:29,659
you save the apps still need some level

00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:32,000
of cooperation on this and then you run

00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:36,049
into the issue that the app now doesn't

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,039
run if robot doesn't run again like I

00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:41,900
said TT RSS is the thing I used the most

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:46,610
there are several Android apps for

00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:48,860
accessing T TR TR TT RSS instance the

00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:52,490
one that I found that works with the

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,700
onion setup is called TT RSS reader the

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:58,299
one called tightening RSS does not work

00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:00,919
either way that configuration is tricky

00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:04,010
the interface is not expecting there to

00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,600
be a tdrss account and a freedombox

00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,250
account so it's a little bit ambiguous

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,210
when it asks you for your username a

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:12,230
password there's also a lot of

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:15,760
authentication settings that can be

00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:18,440
confusing to read for example tdrss has

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,870
two settings one says accept all

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,730
certificates yes or no yeah this is

00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,440
accept certificates from all hosts yes

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,630
or no

00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,929
I think I know what they're getting out

00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:33,740
there but at only after a lot of deep

00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:36,620
meditation there's also some issues in a

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:39,409
lot of Android apps where they may tie

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,190
into something like TT RSS can use

00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:44,029
Google Play server

00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:46,159
is I think for some level of certificate

00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:48,590
checking there's a it's a switch to

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,419
disable that but you need to be aware of

00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:54,830
that if you're if your goal in running

00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:58,460
freedom box is to stay away from that's

00:31:54,830 --> 00:32:01,429
for a corporate infrastructure radical

00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,769
is the same Sri were their mobile apps

00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:06,700
available that speak Kelvin card now

00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:09,740
it's great that it's a you know standard

00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,299
protocol like that and the one that I

00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,340
found that that works the best is damn

00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:17,210
droid used to be called that now they

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,769
want you to call it of x5 and that the

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,909
five is supposed to be a superscript I

00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:23,480
don't do that when you're naming your

00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:25,519
projects I've also tried a count simple

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:31,309
counter without success either way

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:33,649
getting that set up is tricky but like I

00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:34,460
said earlier reticule running on

00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:37,309
freedombox

00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:39,110
doesn't give you a UI to create counters

00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:40,850
or do create events so you will have to

00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,240
do something like this just to get

00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:45,200
started

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,720
but it's convenient and you also when

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,610
you're looking at apps you need to be

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,529
sure that they do create counters

00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,700
because not all of them do there are

00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:54,529
some that are just designed to

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,230
synchronize a CalDAV source with your

00:32:54,529 --> 00:33:01,250
google calendar your android calendar or

00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:03,710
whatever and that has an anti feature

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,600
angle too as well which is that they ask

00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:09,669
permission to access the system calendar

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,669
and maybe you don't want to do that I

00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:14,539
think Oh goddamn Troy it does have one

00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,580
additional anti feature which is that

00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:19,429
when you sign in with your username and

00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,080
password for the radical instance it

00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:23,720
asks you if you want to save it to the

00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:27,110
phone's password service which won't

00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,429
sing it maybe you choose good passwords

00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,899
that's not an issue but it's kind of

00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:34,789
thing you have to have the check so

00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:37,899
assessment time I've had this going for

00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:43,480
about seven months looking back on that

00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:45,980
how does for your box fare well

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:50,149
your freedom box Q's case may differ a

00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:51,590
lot from mine for me I obviously

00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:53,059
everyone can have an opinion about this

00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,429
and they're all worth exactly the same

00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:57,769
but a lot of times I feel like those of

00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:59,840
us in the free software community can

00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:02,000
prep prioritize the wrong thing there's

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,750
a lot of emphasis on getting your Gmail

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,990
your email out of Gmail to me and I feel

00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,700
like countering contacts are much bigger

00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:13,520
privacy targets than were then we're

00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:15,800
aware of my calendar tells you where I

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,030
am and what I do my contacts are always

00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,339
trying to be harvested other

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,500
applications and things so I would say

00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:26,720
freedom box really needs to come with a

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:29,089
web interface for reticule I also like I

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,810
mentioned I'm using Japan use your calc

00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:34,609
either things I think keeping it outside

00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:38,839
of services like Google Docs is pretty

00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:42,409
important to consider too so those would

00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:43,460
be things I would like to see added on

00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:46,460
the other hand there are a lot of

00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,200
text-based chat programs in freedombox

00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:52,250
and I'm not sure that that's really so

00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,960
important anymore maybe some of the

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,680
publishing apps that would have used if

00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:01,520
they were more modern like like like

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:04,220
mastodons we'll see the last one though

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,730
I feel like we got to make it easy to

00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:09,589
publish a free software project so

00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,700
offers something like get lab or

00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:13,040
something lighter weight than good lab

00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:18,050
out of the box of APRI and box might be

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,849
useful to people and a few others set of

00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:22,339
comments not about the modules

00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:26,390
themselves it's you can you can add your

00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:27,050
own admin module to plinth but it's not

00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,970
easy to do

00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:32,260
it's Jango I've done just enough Jango

00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:34,579
development my time to appreciate it but

00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,380
the process is repetitive if you do this

00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:38,030
multiple times I feel like maybe we

00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,800
could make that simpler to just add

00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,839
something and get that checkbox that

00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,960
turn it on or off

00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:46,400
doesn't seem doable to me and then the

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,800
client application it's like every

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,109
module that you install that needs a

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,599
desktop client application it says that

00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:54,969
gives you a link in the plinth

00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:59,369
interface I think we could go further on

00:35:54,969 --> 00:36:04,209
that and it's often in free software you

00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:06,069
you face this wall of choice as soon as

00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:08,259
you decide to do something oh you want

00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:09,880
to run free operates great you need to

00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:12,160
choose a distribution which is the word

00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,459
you've never heard before and you have

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,839
no information on how to do that so good

00:36:15,459 --> 00:36:19,269
luck and whichever one you choose it's

00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:22,239
your tribe for the next ten years and

00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:23,739
that happens in smaller ways too you

00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,439
want to set up Mastodon first thing you

00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:27,519
have to do is choose an instance I don't

00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:31,029
know we could make that a little bit

00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:33,669
nicer I think specifically if you like

00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:36,429
maybe we ought to work better on the

00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:37,749
mobile side of things first the reason I

00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:39,459
didn't really use those text chat

00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:42,759
applications is that I use things like

00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:45,009
like signal and telegram and so do most

00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:46,479
people I know there's different

00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:50,549
challenges with mobile apps and desktop

00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:52,689
apps but you know it's worth maybe

00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:54,939
collaborating more closely between the

00:36:52,689 --> 00:36:56,919
desktop world and the mobile world but

00:36:54,939 --> 00:37:01,869
will apps bit rock quicker it seems like

00:36:56,919 --> 00:37:04,599
or at least at the whim of Android and

00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:06,640
then also it's probably obvious but I

00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:08,409
think making everything work on tour is

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,559
a great idea at the beginning I thought

00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:14,079
this was a quirky corner case but it it

00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:15,489
does more than reveal amusing usability

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,169
issues I think there are benefits for

00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:19,839
real people to making this work I think

00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:23,349
we gotta support letting any tour I mean

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:29,019
letting any module be torrefied through

00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:31,119
the plinth interface be a big win if we

00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:34,989
do that I think we get to pick our spot

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,479
on this meaningless graph and make

00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:40,359
things better so that's all I have to

00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:42,759
say thank you for listening usually you

00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:44,859
can bug me about things we have a few

00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:47,469
minutes if there are questions I'd be

00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:49,659
happy to field them and then I have to

00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:53,400
rush off to the other room and give them

00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:53,400
other talk so thanks

00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:09,280
and I honestly can't season so you

00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,990
talked about the to the usability issues

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,330
you had in various things what what

00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,410
about the sort of latency issues you're

00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,540
saying you're in a different country

00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:19,450
obviously there's some overhead of using

00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:22,390
tor do you find that that impacts the

00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:24,340
the use of your tor services or or does

00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:26,380
not just not ready factor I'm sorry I

00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:31,650
didn't tell you I'm curious about

00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:31,650
latency issues in a different country

00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:40,390
enough for yeah actually that was one of

00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:42,730
the very early on when I thought I'm

00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,530
just gonna use SSH and get it a machine

00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,420
and configure it it was because I was

00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:50,440
expecting the latency to just support

00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:53,580
that and I was pleasantly surprised to

00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,870
find that so many things works great so

00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:58,420
that the Tor network has expanded

00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:01,780
apparently a lot in capacity in and just

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:03,280
size since the last time I spent too

00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,980
much time on it but yeah I have not

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,670
generally encountered latency issues

00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:11,500
with tor that made it hard to use unless

00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,700
I was experiencing latency on the

00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,480
network anyway in which case is not

00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:19,120
force fault but yeah it's been

00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,450
remarkably remarkably quick this year

00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,450
especially

00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:35,510
so when there are no more questions then

00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,510
thank you very much

00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:41,849
