After 4 releases of Debian with OpenStack, we now have Buster that is shipped with the first OpenStack installer. This installer has been written from scratch, and represent 1 year of development. It was very shortly presented last year in Debconf Taiwan. As it is now production ready, this is now time to show the world how it works.

This presentation will go over details of how to use OCI, and how it can be used to deploy OpenStack under Debian.

Details about OCI can be read over here: https://salsa.debian.org/openstack-team/debian/openstack-cluster-installer
