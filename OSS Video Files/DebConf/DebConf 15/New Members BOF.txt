	00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:32,289
to be people

00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,289
[Music]

00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:00,120
people become developers which is

00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,120
exactly the same

00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,990
[Music]

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:36,620
and that's what we are talking about so

00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:42,739
the general idea is that you one doesn't

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:47,060
need to be but at some point when

00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:57,650
somebody's already a contributor it's

00:02:47,060 --> 00:03:00,760
nice to get living here it's nice to be

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:12,440
able to vote for federal elections

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:18,019
that's idea the process so how many of

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:21,620
you already know about all this how many

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:24,010
of you didn't know about this kind of

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,010
structure

00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:48,370
how many of you to note where is your

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:51,280
hand so the point of this meeting is a

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,230
bit about figuring out how this is

00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:00,780
working at the moment if that our

00:03:53,230 --> 00:04:05,919
problems won't could be improved so that

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,750
it's not just the people who kind of the

00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,629
coal developers of the project that have

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,269
an idea what is going on but that other

00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:15,280
people know it because for example I'm

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:18,609
the person that develops the site and

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,560
end up you know mostly but I write code

00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:26,860
than anything to forget to tell people

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:29,410
what I did and and then there is

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:38,909
confusion and so at least once a year we

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:38,909
can have the new man the process has

00:04:46,430 --> 00:05:00,750
has a number of people involved there's

00:04:49,680 --> 00:05:07,650
none that have responsibility over the

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:39,979
membership in Debian so I am one mu is

00:05:07,650 --> 00:06:07,430
one gama phys one took the and from this

00:05:39,979 --> 00:06:11,520
that help around the process emeritus

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:22,520
and from this of the nm process is not

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:22,520
from desk on that and then

00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:34,189
application managers that are deaf in

00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:36,650
developers that have a conversation with

00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:41,840
people who are getting an account to

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:45,490
kind of figure out if it fits people

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:50,469
that already have experience of that yet

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,469
and then this allocates

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:10,080
um

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,879
there are people who that anyway been

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,090
developed that can say that person is

00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:23,530
not that mean developer but he or she

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:28,770
should be and that starts the process so

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:34,000
you enter somehow by invitation and then

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:36,460
the rest of the ritual and that's I

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,180
think the what did I miss

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:42,180
the names he knew - oh yeah

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:14,850
and the applicants of course how many of

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:27,229
you are dead you'll notice there are

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:27,229
maintained s applicants advocates

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:37,020
application managers okay there's a

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:40,080
little Bible input

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,080
[Music]

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,010
so we start with a simple

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:03,960
but so it's not just me talking because

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,050
it's about so we are all here and

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,630
they're sorry another diverse

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:20,020
organization of things we also have some

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:29,140
peering to maintain at least one first

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:32,650
remain anonymous that after Indian

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:37,060
emphasis after we decided a person

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:40,110
should have an account we asked the GP

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:43,330
GP to the Debian theorem which then

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:47,680
makes that he recognized to the rest of

00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:49,870
the system for hoping approval and also

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,570
things and then the second system

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:56,140
administrators that create the account

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:59,070
for the denote machines so that's a bit

00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,070
of everyone in the room

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:35,410
so any of us questions problems feedback

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:35,410
I have a question between the other side

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:43,870
for those of you that are either already

00:10:49,960 --> 00:11:13,000
I have no idea what it looks like and I

00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:16,720
had at that time already appear from the

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,720
philosophy in with something

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,530
but these crest stop looks from the

00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,530
heart

00:11:40,380 --> 00:12:35,510
I went to our wiki page about it I doubt

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,510
I know the

00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,100
[Music]

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:48,709
and after some at reproduce that I went

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:52,139
to evolve from a person I I heard that

00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:53,130
you are using you are never asking

00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,380
questions you are doing killed

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,959
everything on your own so here you

00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,420
should be ready for taking developer but

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,100
at the same time from looking at my game

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,050
level and the brightest I'm not sure

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,459
whether this is correct a problem

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:16,160
because as we try to buy up the king of

00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:16,160
one of the things I'm wondering

00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:31,010
speak to me that you don't want to okay

00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,650
[Laughter]

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,320
yeah just just go put okay you do baby

00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,900
devil is about the hole there in

00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:07,080
technical ecosystem and you don't need

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:09,120
to be out of all of subsystems yeah -

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:16,190
University goodness won't stay in there

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:16,190
or never leave it I'm high I believe me

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:26,730
I think it stumbled about your sentence

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,160
you are not asking any question anymore

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,710
already for the UN develop and see if

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,850
this is exciting I should lose my status

00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:42,060
a lot of questions I can't answer myself

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:44,670
and I also asked on Delia mentors which

00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,760
is to mentor people because we have so

00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,730
many different spheres of knowledge not

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:56,070
the same person can we finish this also

00:14:49,730 --> 00:15:00,270
yeah I keep on asking question and one

00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:02,790
thing that I noticed is that the a lot

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,680
of the documentation for the new member

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:08,070
process is from before

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,800
Debian maintainer were thing so if you

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,230
are a Debian maintainer already you

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,910
start in a different part of the process

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,530
like if you're just following the

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,450
checklist the first like four or five

00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:46,530
steps don't apply and

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:46,530
none of the documentation like and then

00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,959
[Music]

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,409
[Music]

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,850
[Music]

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,160
[Music]

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,619
[Music]

00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:20,990
and the reason there is a distinction is

00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:23,690
because if somebody's not interested in

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:30,170
our clothing then we can just skip a lot

00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:35,030
of it's about responsibility

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:37,220
so normally there's what's what's

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,940
checked in the human the process is that

00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:45,190
one knows what that beam is about

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:45,190
because we we want to pass that people

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:52,390
become both the members in a community

00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:55,070
that they have some idea how it works

00:17:52,390 --> 00:18:00,890
because otherwise there's not much point

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:02,960
whole thing and then we need to trust

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,000
people know how to interact with the

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,210
rest of the community so like using the

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,210
back tracking system that people

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:14,660
understand the social contracts and the

00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:19,670
benefits of the guidelines that are the

00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:25,880
essential common guidelines of the whole

00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:27,550
process that people understand the rules

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,920
for using that

00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:34,510
infrastructure so you don't log into a

00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:40,530
Debian machine and start sending out

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:44,350
spam or something like that and that's

00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:46,600
for everyone so being responsible

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,810
members of the community because the

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:53,680
account kind of gives oh what you get

00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:56,920
from being from what you don't have as a

00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,890
Debian contributor base official

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,540
responsibility you kind of have a

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,070
responsibility towards your own

00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,110
reputation but that's it

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,450
but when you are a member of the project

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,280
you are the responsibility of you know

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,620
sending out emails with a Libyan or

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:17,170
address somehow presenting the project

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:18,880
or both or logging into machines so we

00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,970
kind of want to make sure that you have

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:27,130
a pmid about that and if you have an

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:29,620
idea about that apply to be and to get

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:32,110
the flow rights we also want to have a

00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:35,260
look that you have an idea about

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:38,650
maintaining packages which ideally

00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,750
should only mean having a look at your

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,450
history of contributions in Debian and

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:48,240
saying holy Oh maintaining boxes since

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:53,980
2008 and finally you have a clue so good

00:19:48,240 --> 00:20:00,420
and there could be some extra question

00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:00,420
asked yes

00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:25,809
which I have an idea of automating that

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:29,009
oh yeah the whole thing has only two

00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:32,440
mandatory questions which is please sign

00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:36,580
this your reply to these two questions

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:39,340
with your GP GP and the question dua the

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:43,499
data social contract and face of the

00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:45,999
guidelines do you agree with them and

00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:49,629
deteriorate the Debian machine uses

00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:51,849
policy and agree with it and there's

00:20:49,629 --> 00:21:02,649
only one valid answer for those who

00:20:51,849 --> 00:21:07,749
didn't get that part I know how to fix

00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:14,619
it I have planned so I want to implement

00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:19,059
the concept of validated key fingerprint

00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:22,269
in the site so when you have a record in

00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:25,289
the side you get a fingerprint and you

00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:28,960
can say validate it and it will ask to

00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:32,739
answer those questions sign and paste

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,349
the sonic bit and check the signature at

00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:39,159
the point it goes in a queue where from

00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:43,419
this people go yeah yeah that pays that

00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:47,109
stuff was nonsense yeah yeah you want

00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:51,999
some no and no because you can't machine

00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:53,739
parts the content of that and I don't

00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:56,109
think that is a poop size that that that

00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:58,599
finger putting kinds of science

00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:59,559
statement on records so with the me to

00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:02,440
ask for that anymore

00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:04,090
and everyone can just go into it and

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,559
that's kind of something I want to do

00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:11,649
because that then enables applying so

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,940
that you maintain abusing besides it's

00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:16,179
kind of recommendation

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:20,769
I had that idea recent we are like time

00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:22,629
to implement it now yeah maybe do the

00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:25,210
abstract abstract from the technical

00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:27,159
implementation of that 20 years ago

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,619
Debian was a small project and getting

00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:32,950
into it was pretty easy you just from

00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:37,239
had one phone call but then there were

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:39,669
many more people and getting the Debian

00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:43,179
part needed to be formalized that was

00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:45,840
when me you member process was invented

00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:51,460
it was abuse be called numerator process

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:54,639
um and at one point it was very

00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:59,429
complicated and that's when people start

00:22:54,639 --> 00:23:04,029
to get afraid of it like being afraid to

00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:08,289
every to answer to many pets or about

00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:10,599
licenses and yeah curvy our since a few

00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:14,409
years ago we are trying to get that back

00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:18,039
to the more sensible state like if you

00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:19,659
have been packaging stuff for yeah we

00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:25,929
all need it doesn't have to be that long

00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:30,700
then you just you will still be required

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:35,080
to about licensing because not obvious

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:36,639
about usually not obvious obviously

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,190
visible in your previous step in

00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:41,769
contribution but if it is because you

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,749
have been posting to it I'm not going to

00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:47,169
say legal but they're in demo a project

00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:49,809
for some time answering questions

00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:53,019
reasonably then you can probably house

00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:55,800
ahead we're from the spot so um Jonathan

00:23:53,019 --> 00:24:24,360
two questions are the same

00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:36,790
it's not English language English

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:39,630
understanding English English is a

00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,630
conversation

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:41,970
[Music]

00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:46,500
there's a new thing that is happening

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:49,410
now because we have a problem with some

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:52,050
application managers tend to take longer

00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:55,020
and longer kind of lose enthusiasm but

00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,910
not retired just kind of hand they have

00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,770
a really good intention and they still

00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:03,300
want to do it but they don't have the

00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:05,400
time and so there isn't time they take

00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:09,540
like weeks to apply and that the most

00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,640
evades people and and that's the only a

00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:14,970
bit of a problem it also works the other

00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,560
way around with applicants taking longer

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:25,410
and longer and the motivating the

00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:28,110
application manager but we now have a

00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:31,020
qualified to calculate the median

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:35,310
response time to email of a fundamental

00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:37,380
process so we can see if we have some

00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:42,020
application manager that's starting to

00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,020
become struggling and say

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,709
[Music]

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:12,920
[Music]

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:14,600
so the ideal sources and I say that's

00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,140
exciting because I'm really bad

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:30,380
answering email but the ideal process

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:32,060
should go through in a week I actually

00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:39,020
went through within a week is that

00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:42,350
possible yeah and that was because I was

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,740
slow as an application manager people

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:49,930
apply to each of my names of questions

00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:52,280
within half an hour because you got both

00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:56,110
waiting for an application manager so I

00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,110
downloaded the list of all the questions

00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:08,120
answered and then so you will like

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:19,910
unusually fast and I was like what's

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:22,930
going on right now but that's been cases

00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:28,880
where it has been a fast

00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:36,230
yeah I think my process took three days

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:39,110
because I was so the idea of the week is

00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:42,920
because when you join you already have

00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:44,930
experience in that way if the

00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,710
application manager sees that people

00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:52,040
maybe struggle with finding basic things

00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:54,890
then one should say as soon as possible

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:57,290
you may want to try again later and have

00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,900
no experience in Debian if somebody

00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:04,640
joins and it's impossible to find any

00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:08,970
track record of contributions visible

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,980
and one asks so what did you do and one

00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:15,760
puffy Olivia was a passing by and got

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:18,720
furious then one could say you want to

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,760
get a bit more info then come back so

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,570
ideally it should be obvious that a

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,760
person is ready to become a that in

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:30,850
development there's tons of exchange of

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:35,350
questions to work out the norm of these

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:36,970
bits like it canvas person be trusted to

00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:40,059
approve news of the interview

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:43,330
do they have an idea whether a license

00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:46,690
is free and non-free or they can't tell

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:50,760
and they should ask somebody else this

00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,760
third thing is extremely important

00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:04,120
because none of us are lawyers

00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:07,360
there are licenses I don't understand it

00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,549
so I want the products and I'll ask and

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:14,620
that's responsible Tejeda

00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:16,750
so absolute knowledge is not requested

00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,600
the responsible behavior is requested

00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,280
that's the idea and it's possible

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,630
behavior is able to say well I don't

00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:29,740
know ask and that's perfect

00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:32,620
so yeah and so a quick thing bamba four

00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:35,169
or five emails answered in a day or two

00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,690
that gets you in the end of the week and

00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:39,630
that's it if somebody's busy I can say

00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,580
I'll be busy for a while

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:45,490
that's put it on hold on people I'll be

00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,080
back from holidays in September or the

00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,210
application manager can say and this is

00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,809
for work this week take me back at the

00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,659
beginning of next week those can happen

00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:58,150
but that's kind of the expected process

00:30:55,659 --> 00:31:01,809
if an application manager becomes busy

00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:03,940
there's a button on the side to say give

00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:05,980
this applicant back to come this and

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:10,770
we'll find another person and there's no

00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:13,410
shame that if an african becomes

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:17,040
uncomfortable divorces it's totally okay

00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:19,490
to say sorry I think this is not my

00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:23,880
place I'll come back after six months

00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:27,720
and there's no problem with any of that

00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:33,420
so so that's the ideal thing the

00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:35,760
practice is different because I guess so

00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:39,480
far is the system that follows the role

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:43,200
of inflation of bureaucracy where when

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:48,390
people are responsible for making a

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:50,190
choice they try to make sure that it's

00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,590
the right choice and always ask for

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:56,160
something more and with a good intention

00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:58,140
of improving the process but that tends

00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,770
to inflate and require more and more

00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:04,590
energy so as an application manager is

00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:08,790
much better to tell a person you should

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:10,530
come back after six months then having

00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:13,050
not so bad to see as women try to teach

00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:16,680
them and deplete of energy over the

00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:18,570
course of months okay they approve of

00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,090
that package trying to fix that thing

00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,070
let me see that you love that thing

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:27,360
that's mentorship it's not application

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:32,040
management men needing to mentor

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:34,440
maintenance not yet there's again men

00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:40,830
those forums I hope they do their job

00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:43,650
well so yeah that's the expectation real

00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:47,580
life may divert from expectations by a

00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:49,880
week or two more it's assigned it as a

00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,880
problem

00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:05,000
so application managers here can you

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:08,020
tell me some stories of reasons why he

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,020
things get stuck

00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:34,180
right spin a month later email yes okay

00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:36,540
here's a tip for you don't look at that

00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:39,160
packages look at the change box and

00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:41,410
there's a function for it on the site

00:33:39,160 --> 00:34:21,010
and if you see the pair of clothing

00:33:41,410 --> 00:34:23,950
packages since if I say things like you

00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:26,700
can copy and paste URLs in your again

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:31,450
process surprise I'm serious you can

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:33,490
what is now allowed is tasting the paste

00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:38,590
in seconds with no attribution because

00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:41,830
that's the reason but it's all very okay

00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:46,020
to say I have no idea I go here's what I

00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:46,020
found from that link sounds reasonable

00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:07,090
looks like the exam of something high

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:12,460
school exam and so it comes with a lot

00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:15,790
of package that really does not fit so

00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,740
yes an exam with no time limit and

00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:20,080
availability of the whole internet and

00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,470
the possibility of asking people over I

00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,470
see

00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:28,980
and mostly things are asked to make sure

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,720
that one is a way of a thing because

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,720
that's one of my favorite

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,600
all my favorite questions

00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,420
is this one

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,130
Oh is there any of these bits of that

00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:09,400
beam that you haven't heard of or of

00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:11,500
which you would like to know more and

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,470
then there's QA team localization

00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,300
website bugs washing parties that wiki

00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:23,830
that takes conflict of interest for

00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:26,410
metrics and so on or anything else you

00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:28,480
have cues about know that I only want to

00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,770
show that they exist and what the point

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:39,790
there are some tips if you are

00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:41,620
interested so there's questions like

00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:45,900
that that that kind of gives an idea of

00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,900
the spiracle of things

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,900
[Laughter]

00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:07,080
from tomorrow there will be more bugs

00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,640
that you know data into contributors

00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,050
that you know can you make found out

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,100
that you've been attending contributor

00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:18,600
since 2003 because we write mails to the

00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:22,790
BTS from waiting of time that we think

00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:27,210
so that's going to be interesting yeah I

00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:29,070
have had a case of me getting stuck in

00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,080
the process because the applicant sent

00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:34,230
the mill and it got stuck in my spam

00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,820
filter and he didn't want to ask me

00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,580
because I thought something was wrong

00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:41,400
and that got stuck for I think a month

00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:44,369
before it send another ping mail which i

00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:48,170
think is fairly problematic because I

00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:48,170
should have send a ping not as well yeah

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,249
before combat

00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,249
[Music]

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:23,610
took me like a month just to say what's

00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:25,770
going on are you known to be seein you

00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:29,610
know the first time it was like it was

00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:32,510
my problem because you want to be

00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:44,300
perfect and that's the problem anything

00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:44,300
come on the way sometime

00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,860
I've been around years and this right

00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,860
this should be

00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,750
[Music]

00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,690
[Music]

00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:54,930
- okay yeah which was definitely wrong

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:58,210
yeah that impression is yeah yeah

00:42:54,930 --> 00:43:01,450
there are TDS who have to be told but

00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:03,369
they were yes definitely good enough to

00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:07,270
become a DD because they already

00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:09,430
maintain 200 packages and yes definitely

00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,660
good enough to be calling themselves the

00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,099
maintainer of this particular package

00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,650
because they've been doing the uploads

00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:16,750
for it for like two years now and so

00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,210
this is perfectly normal that you have

00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:21,940
people who think they're not good enough

00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:27,089
and convicting them otherwise might be

00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:27,089
difficult but yeah it happens more

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:40,119
but Debian our process it was even if I

00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:42,040
drove like a ball is getting free / free

00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:44,020
games for developers and it sound like

00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,240
it's probably much easier you know to do

00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:49,809
a mess Tomita or something you know

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,460
graphical stack it's not reality of fact

00:43:49,809 --> 00:43:53,170
it's much harder than them flying ashes

00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,290
for that their membership but we kinda

00:43:53,170 --> 00:44:00,309
know like if you say like yeah I applied

00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:03,180
for definitely yeah that me feels like

00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:05,950
that intimidating you know public

00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,500
picture I don't know how that might

00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:11,920
happen but it's done yeah it's difficult

00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:13,930
to say I mean we can't really say anyone

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,210
can become a libel developer apply now

00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:19,260
and it's easy to do it because there are

00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:24,190
ladies able to when a lot typical people

00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:26,680
before the sexual life like I'm going to

00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:34,170
go to the door at smashing or I'm going

00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:34,170
to arch packages but even they did

00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:44,520
that sounds like about

00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:10,640
click on the ok

00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,190
the last one Oh

00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:26,790
okay there's activity all may have gone

00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:26,790
missing

00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:33,359
[Music]

00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,160
three ranked

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,130
Oh

00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,130
[Music]

00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:42,150
so the lesson in this is if you get no

00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:48,600
apply within March to August is about

00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:50,610
five months but even one week send an

00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:57,630
email to when I'm at the Vienna organ

00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:59,550
ask body is going on because you would

00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:02,090
have been through it four months ago if

00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:02,090
you have done that

00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:21,559
we are I will take that button away from

00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:21,559
the side yeah

00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,930
well I should eventually I should

00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:32,200
actually the best solution is to

00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:34,510
implemented but at the moment it's

00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,810
falling an improvement to take the

00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:40,690
pattern away so to prevent the queues in

00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,820
the water at a time people take me to

00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:46,500
the vintage and then send an email to

00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,500
all the people that are in that state

00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:12,350
thanks for raising that

00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,079
[Music]

00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:39,410
yeah it goes

00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:42,489
it was so easily prevented in this way

00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,489
[Music]

00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:57,070
yeah there's another potential factor

00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:58,750
that confusing things which is that and

00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:01,420
I think at this point it's only a really

00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:03,099
old documentation refers to Debian

00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:20,190
developers with uploading privileges as

00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:20,190
Debian maintainers maybe it's also

00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:29,800
Constitution they make references to

00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:32,680
being emulators me like all Debian

00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,619
developers because this is like it meant

00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:42,849
Debian developers and like their ilk or

00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:48,820
something no this fits mentors this is

00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:50,079
maintained errs but not millions just

00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,759
segment

00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:56,900
they might they been lower kiss em

00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:59,029
maintain errs okay someone needs to

00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:02,930
reread that and then make something

00:50:59,029 --> 00:51:08,779
Ettore changes editorial or chart with a

00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:11,059
phrase like principal level documents it

00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:13,369
may not be the Constitution itself but

00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:36,799
it's like one of the like really old big

00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:40,579
ones maintain and slightly overloaded

00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:43,460
and maintaining a package doesn't make

00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:45,109
you formal them in maintainer Debbie

00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,059
maintainer are you if you're in that

00:51:45,109 --> 00:51:49,460
Debbie maintained us hearing that allows

00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:53,839
you to act actually uploads stuff today

00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:56,329
mean if you are listed in a control file

00:51:53,839 --> 00:52:00,470
of a package that just makes you someone

00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:04,220
maintaining this package so there's no

00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:06,640
point in getting Mikey sign to upload if

00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:10,839
you want to upload the package yourself

00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,839
you need a sign key yes

00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:47,839
and then you can go through lots of so

00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:58,599
if you have a package if you want to get

00:52:47,839 --> 00:53:03,020
into digging ok with yourself so the

00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:06,020
control file the 9 Turner Field is the

00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:10,869
person that gets email if a bug is

00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:10,869
imported to the package 15 minutes

00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:22,580
closes are the people that can sign

00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:24,349
appear in the change look as the user

00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:28,490
maintenance instead of

00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:30,380
non-methane Ellis loads so the people

00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:42,730
that generally do the work in the

00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:46,480
package makes you one of the maintenance

00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:46,480
applause there is a titanium

00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:58,410
no disrespect I am yeah I thought this

00:53:54,990 --> 00:54:12,690
is a bad name it in that case it's you

00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:16,730
was a you something else that life

00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:20,160
started but not all mental are uploaders

00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:22,020
that because you can maintain things and

00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,870
ask somebody else to close it it used to

00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:26,610
be worse when the new member process one

00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,340
comment was called you maintain a

00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:30,419
process

00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,419
[Music]

00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,540
[Music]

00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:47,590
on WCW knock slash never join or

00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,390
whatever it's called I think it should

00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:51,630
just be removed because it's all days

00:54:49,390 --> 00:55:09,070
and no one is working

00:54:51,630 --> 00:55:12,210
yeah okay well to summarize the things

00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:12,210
that I want know

00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:33,990
and the recyclable cancer guess the big

00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:37,470
deal is Arby's okay and the site isn't

00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:38,970
any jungle where the nose Python and

00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:46,910
Django and would like to help

00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:49,170
wait working on it get in touch with me

00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:58,109
does that mean you get to cheat and make

00:55:49,170 --> 00:56:00,060
it so it means that you are listed as -

00:55:58,109 --> 00:56:06,839
contributors or contributors that you're

00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:12,570
not actually you know it and for the

00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:16,430
rest you know is the email to use for

00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:20,220
pretty much anything and it's safe space

00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:22,800
and it's pretty hard that you write to

00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:47,160
that and somebody replies you shall be

00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:53,490
ever again lots of new am accounts it's

00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:57,170
the developer breakfast like it doesn't

00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:57,170
look like a real updated since first way

00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:05,100
okay yeah

00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:10,070
okay so there's no gap from this top the

00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:10,070
next so we need to evacuate them

00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:15,020
