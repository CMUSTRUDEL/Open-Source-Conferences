https://debconf15.debconf.org/

Debian is among the oldest GNU/Linux distributions still active 
today.  A community-led project with democratically elected
leadership, Debian remains a shining example of a project that
serves developers and users rather than for profit interests and
wealthy trade associations that so commonly control and
manipulate Open Source projects today.  Debian culture embodies
the ethos of software freedom and the tradition of enthusiasts
and hobbyists (rather than businesses) directing the future of
Free Software projects.

As an independent observer and Debian user, in this keynote, I 
will examine the reasons why these principles have served Debian
well, considered early decisions that Debian made that have
assured a commitment to principle, explore how Debian can
continue to help everyone, introduce future collaborations that 
might succeed in helping Debian in its goals, and discuss the
unique role Debian can play in advancing software freedom.

so I I'm I have to be honest I I'm

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,929
really honored to be here and I don't

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,750
say that to just every conference I I

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,790
care a lot about Debian this is my third

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,199
Deb Kampf I've ever been to there's been

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,720
a lot of them so I haven't obviously

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,820
been to that many it turns out I was at

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,220
Deb Kampf one which I just learned today

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,369
that it was zero base so it wasn't the

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,750
first up cough which I should have known

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:29,279
but but I didn't for some reason I

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,579
thought I so I was at the second Deb

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,930
Kampf and by accident somewhat because I

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,700
was going to leave her sophomore meeting

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,040
and just happened to book my flight so

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,379
that I could be at Deb comp as well and

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,510
I because it was in New York City where

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,129
I lived at the time I gave a regular

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,230
track talk at 10:00 about the gplv3 and

00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,390
here I'm giving an invited speaker talk

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,940
or a keynote or whatever it is it's

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,360
called here and that really means a lot

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,609
to me I'm a fan of Debian I'm a user of

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,489
Debian I don't actually consider myself

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,049
part of the Debian community because

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,030
other than filing a few bugs over the

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,150
years I haven't contributed all that

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,770
much to Debian but I've relied on it and

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,900
used it and been a fan of it for so long

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,330
then I really love your project so I

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,950
really am honored to be invited to speak

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:22,710
here and I really believe that Debian is

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,880
a very special project for a lot of

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,579
reasons first of all it's thrived for

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,770
longer than almost any free software

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,720
project in existence in a lot of ways

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,700
there there are a top ten list of

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,439
projects that have been certainly on as

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:43,310
far as longevity goes maybe the top 5

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,030
its governance is one of the few

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,430
democratically elected and

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,340
democratically controlled governance

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,960
processes in free software everyone's a

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,880
fan of talking about this benevolent

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,759
dictator stuff which i think is really

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,899
horrible actually the fact that somebody

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,360
would call themself a self-appointed

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,119
benevolent dictator for life is really

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,649
disturbing but you all are democratic

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,780
you elect your leadership you have

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:10,020
referendums on major issues that

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,840
everyone can vote on that is amazingly

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,980
rare impressive and important for free

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,239
software

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,069
the other thing that really impresses me

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,800
particularly being somebody from the

00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:23,500
nonprofit world is that Debian has been

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,989
staunchly non-commercial for its entire

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,010
existence and of course I don't mean

00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:32,799
that by that Debian can't be used in

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,560
commercial settings DFS g-free means

00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:37,959
that things can be put into commercial

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,390
products what I mean is the project

00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,160
itself has always been non-commercial

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,500
meaning that the people that work on it

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,940
or volunteering and even if their

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,470
employer is paying them to work on it

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,549
they are part of a community and not

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,569
doing their work inside Debian as

00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:55,090
officially part of some commercial

00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:57,190
activity most free software projects

00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,890
these days are controlled by some

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:04,239
commercial entity or another Debian is

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:08,019
not so I was at Def Con 1 which was

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,510
really exciting for me I was a young

00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:12,610
executive director of free software and

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,290
you know Karen Sandler whom I work with

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,360
I showed her this picture online last

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,889
night and I told look how different I

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,139
look and she says I don't look different

00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:21,519
at all but speaking as the person who

00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:24,700
looks at that face in the mirror every

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,230
morning ignoring the fact that it's you

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,750
know this wasn't high pixel quality it

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,549
was 2001 there are a lot more lines on

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,340
my face than there that is it that is a

00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,889
smooth looking baby face that I had 14

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,680
years ago they do not have anymore

00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:41,349
and I was pretty casual back then you

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,609
know I'm I'm actually not in short

00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:44,019
trousers anymore which I apparently

00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:45,940
they're it's hard to see you can see it

00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:48,730
some of the other photos I was I haven't

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,010
more even in this heat worn short

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,310
trousers in a very very long time

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,919
and here what's that yeah you know I

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,180
mean out you know I figured you would be

00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,190
in front actually I was thinking about

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,470
mentioning you and now I have to cuz

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,299
your your your heckling me yeah that'd

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,220
be don't be Dell is the one you know

00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:07,930
adult in the room who can dress like

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,329
everybody else but I can't pull it off

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,040
and I respect you know that he can that

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:13,959
the tide I still works for him and I

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,489
stopped wearing t-shirts years ago at

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,950
conferences and Here I am sweating and

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:21,579
my and my long sleeve you know halfway

00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:23,229
between hacker and suit attire and then

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,860
I'm talking to Martin Michael Mayer and

00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,169
I'm gonna do questions at the end Mars

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,840
that's okay I'm not good with questions

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,979
because I get off-topic easy but I left

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,750
17 minutes at the end for questions

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:36,050
which bTW I'll just took three of but

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,629
anyway so so there I am talking to

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,479
Martin Michael Mayer when I first met

00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:44,020
him and so a lot of things have changed

00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,979
since I've looked at this photo

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,379
obviously but one thing that hasn't

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:50,449
changed if you look you see this face

00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:52,340
this Martin is making he still makes

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:54,289
that face at me every time I talk to him

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,030
which sort of says like you do not know

00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:58,400
what you're talking about and so that

00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,719
hasn't changed which is good I'm glad

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,120
he's laughing in the back there yeah so

00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:03,650
some things have stayed the same Martin

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,110
still thinks I'm full of it and I

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:11,509
probably am so that's that's okay

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:13,370
I like people to keep me honest but

00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,409
other than jokes the the thing that

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,909
really hasn't changed since I first was

00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:21,800
introduced to the Debian community in

00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:24,259
person back in 2001 is the ethos of this

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,550
community is still the same one that I

00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,469
remember even though a lot of the

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,419
developers have changed I talked to

00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:31,370
somebody who had never even installed

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,779
Debian when they're at DEFCON 1 I talked

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:37,250
to somebody who was 12 years old when

00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:39,139
Deb conf one happened I find it

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,060
impressive that the what I call the

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:45,770
morality of the hobbyist contributor

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:49,069
still lives strongly and Debian the

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,539
people in Debian I find that I meet want

00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:52,430
to do what's right for other people

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:55,729
their users their co developers their Co

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,800
contributors and they also volunteer to

00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:00,319
do that and as I said before it doesn't

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,759
mean that they're not being paid to do

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,990
their work and it's the classic free

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,000
software thing lots of people get paid

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,000
to write free software what I've seen

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,819
recently in many free software projects

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,710
is that companies have used that I think

00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:14,599
OpenStack is one of the the worst

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,189
examples of this to really control a

00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,479
project by just hiring a lot of its

00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:20,120
developers and they have this kind of

00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:21,650
pull over the project and I think a lot

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,089
of people who work on OpenStack would

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,740
say they're their employers employee

00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:27,620
first and it opens that contributor

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,750
second I know nobody in Debian who would

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,000
not say I'm a Debian developer first and

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,740
then I happen to be employed as a second

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,740
issue Debian is their first priority

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,020
they're a job is their second and that

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,000
culture of the hot

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,979
hobbyist culture of my volunteer work

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,400
matters more to me than what actually

00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:47,979
pays me for a living is the kind of

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,069
mentality that I am such a fan of and I

00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:53,319
try to live my my own work as well and I

00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:54,970
like interacting with a community I find

00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,800
conferences very stressful usually this

00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,180
one I do not find a stressful other than

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
I'm standing a room with a huge number

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,840
of people but other than that stress I

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,550
don't find this that's stressful because

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,840
this is that kind of community that

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,699
thinks that way and I think a lot of it

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,580
has to do with the other structures you

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,380
set up around yourself the idea of

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,050
having charities that you work with

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,090
which you have chosen to do a multi

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,530
charity situation where you have lots of

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,110
charities around the world that you can

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:26,770
interact with one of which was founded

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,780
by a Debian developer initially and then

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,080
you reach out to other partnerships with

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:34,960
charities as a non-commercial community

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,569
that allows you to have an

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,789
infrastructure that you can rely on that

00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:43,240
helps you maintain that community and

00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:44,770
I'm very glad that you all do that the

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,000
other thing I want to mention is it goes

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,530
back very very far

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,849
I always love to remind cuz I used to

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,630
work for the FSF I'm still on the board

00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:51,180
of directors I'd like to remind

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,590
everybody that early in the project

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,659
episode episode Debian was more or less

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,210
a good new project for a while it was

00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:59,889
part of the FSF I know that relationship

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,419
between the Debian community the FSF has

00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,479
never been perfect and is sometimes

00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:06,789
rocky and sometimes better but the FSF

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,009
saw this in Debian to very early on that

00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:11,110
it was something was a really important

00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,060
way to begin the whole distribution

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,669
thing of free software and that that

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,889
culture was a match with FSF's culture I

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,349
know I know that where the issues are

00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:22,419
and John's here to talk to you about

00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:24,840
them I'm sure but I think there's a lot

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:30,340
of cultural connect between the FSF and

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:32,050
Debian now I find myself I'm a little

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,240
obsessed with this quote I don't I guess

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,940
it's because I saw it in real time I was

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,789
subscribed to come OS MINIX in August of

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,130
91 what it was when it was posted so I

00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:44,290
saw it go by in real-time somehow I've

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,000
always been obsessed with this quote and

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,070
part of it was when I started working

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,260
for the FSF I started thinking about

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,460
this quote and I was like well ok this

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,110
organization when I

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,400
workfare had seven employees it still

00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:00,640
has under 20 employees that's not big so

00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,410
III don't think of it as big and I guess

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,720
strictly speaking since the FSF is a

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,380
very professional organization and sort

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,420
of take the strict definition

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,340
professional it means you get paid to do

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,100
this thing if you do it for a living

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,690
yes the FSF staff are professionals in

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,850
all the ways you might use the word

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,190
professional but I don't think that's

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,350
what meanness was going for in this

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,400
quote I didn't think he meant those

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:26,650
normal things about professional I think

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,210
what he was going for is he was trying

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,560
to create Linux back when he was humble

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,130
because people forget leanest used to be

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,770
really humble

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:38,230
once upon a time what's that I don't

00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,490
know okay I think someone who's early

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,710
post more humble but okay we could we

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,360
can debate that I suppose but I think he

00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:46,510
I think one of the things that leanness

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,300
understood well was that he wanted to

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,040
create a project where individuals

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,690
collaborated together get together in

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,790
their own capacity he when he wanted a

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,280
hobbyist kind of culture and and was

00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:01,330
interested in that kind of culture I

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:05,950
think that what he got wrong was not

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:07,690
realizing how important charities are to

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,460
that culture and I think Debian has

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,860
always gotten that right you've always

00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,790
interacted with charities in good ways I

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,940
think you keep them at arm's length

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,500
which is okay and and reasonable but

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,820
you've always seen their value and

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,310
you've always seen the connection

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,740
between being a non-commercial hobbyist

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,050
controlled projects very professional I

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,940
think but still hobbyist controlled in

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,860
the sense of you are volunteers doing

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:33,070
the right things for everyone in your

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,390
community but at the same time reaching

00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,370
out to these charities and letting them

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,080
help you get done what you need to do in

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:42,670
the logistical world outside of your

00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,280
project what I've seen in other projects

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:47,830
that Debian has not suffered from is the

00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,050
politics of the projects have bifurcated

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,940
there's the technical politics which are

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,100
the usual arguments about this

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,380
technology versus that technology to you

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,470
know say oh I don't know system D vs.

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:01,900
upstart something like that but there's

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,940
also and that I think in almost every

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,610
project still remains under developer

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,950
control

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,290
people who are developers decide

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,360
technical decisions like that but the

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,839
political governance in most other

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,940
projects has been hijacked in my view by

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,339
various different groups depending on

00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,160
the project but it's usually some mix of

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:24,709
kind of lorry business lawyers or

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,800
business type people who are in somehow

00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:29,329
it for-profit companies or industry

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,279
controlled trade associations that have

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:32,839
taken over the political governance the

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,300
reason they've succeeded in doing this I

00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,490
think is because most developers care

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,050
deeply about the technical politics but

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,220
not so much about the other politics

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,050
they want to kind of make those

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,940
decisions once and leave them alone a

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,070
lot of my work in Conservancy is trying

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,690
to help developers make those decisions

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,220
right once and then be able to leave

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,620
them alone without it having bite them

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,100
later but I think a lot of projects have

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,510
faced that situation where the

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,660
non-technical politics of their project

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:01,880
are under the control of people who are

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:05,240
not members of the community not really

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,380
and I think that has really happened to

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,029
Linux I think that the Linux

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,949
non-technical politics are out of the

00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:16,370
hands of the developers and it's a very

00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:18,730
sad thing from my point of view I think

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:22,310
the company's control those politics and

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:25,430
they don't keep developers out entirely

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,890
but they get keep from letting certain

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:30,110
developers into the politics of what's

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:33,230
really going on in the non-technical

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,709
space and I've met many Linux developers

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,870
who feel disenfranchised it's why

00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:42,740
Conservancy has a GPL enforcement

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:45,230
project for Linux because they've come

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,199
to us to ask for someone who has a

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,420
charitable mission to do the right thing

00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:52,190
for the public good as opposed to

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,070
whatever the companies are in front of

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:57,110
and I think that's what these charities

00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,579
serve I think if you look at any of

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,500
these charities that we have out there

00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:03,980
it's Conservancy software the Public

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:07,339
Interest FSF they do the things for

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,410
hobbyist developers that are the morally

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:12,980
right thing to do but are sometimes

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,899
controversial that developers actually

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,700
really need maybe sometimes don't want

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:19,510
to spend too much time on because

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,680
more interested in other things but

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:24,790
companies and trade associations don't

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,190
need them in fact they often oppose them

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:31,520
as I said we're doing at Conservancy the

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,440
GPL enforcement for Linux because it is

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,200
not in the business interest of the

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,360
companies who invest in Linux to see the

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,810
GPL enforce many cases they actually

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,090
oppose it being enforced at all which

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,830
brings me to copyleft generally my last

00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:49,130
talk to all of you was at DEFCON 10

00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:53,390
where I told you about GPL v3 and how

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:55,190
wonderful it is and how much I respected

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,390
Debian's commitment to copyleft no

00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,740
that's not to say that everything in the

00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,180
archive is copyleft I would guess

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,640
probably most things in the archive

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,090
aren't as it turns out but there are

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,380
many many important things in Debian's

00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,600
archives that are copyleft and in many

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,950
Debian meta projects that you all rely

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,440
on every day as part of your development

00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,300
that you have chosen to copy left so I

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,510
see Debian as a strongly connected

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:20,410
project to the broader copyleft

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:24,410
community which I am heavily involved in

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:26,510
I'm excessively involved in it you might

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,090
say the organization I work for is

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,010
funding a lawsuit here in Germany

00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:33,250
against VMware for violating the GPL for

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:36,440
a very long time and refusing to comply

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,330
Christophe Helwig is the plaintiff it is

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,050
in a berlin court Phil Jaeger is his

00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:46,820
lawyer and you have to go read the FAQ I

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:48,260
am admittedly not as comfortable with

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,270
the German legal system as I am with the

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,160
u.s. I am used to the US where

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,330
everything is public the German legal

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,520
system doesn't work that way

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,350
I respect the cultural difference and

00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,240
therefore we put what we could in the

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,740
faq so you can go read it so if you were

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,000
hoping to hear all about the VMware

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,620
lawsuit in this talk this is the only

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,290
slide that covers it sorry to say you

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,610
can load your browser maybe FAQ I guess

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,880
the interesting thing that I can talk

00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,260
about is the aftermath in the politics

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,510
in the community that I think a lot of

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,070
people even people in this room got

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:21,260
wrong about what was going to happen

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:23,420
after we sued VMware I have myself been

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,850
a little bit surprised that the response

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,890
by many for-profit companies in the back

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,020
channels this has not been impressed

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,470
releases obviously

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,740
has been to attempt to eradicate

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:38,800
copyleft entirely or at the very least

00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,150
stop its enforcement at this point for

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,190
anybody who wants to make a strong

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,160
commitment like Christophe like me to

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:47,620
spend a lot of time enforcing GPL it is

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,260
an extremely politically treacherous

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,020
decision we have people in our GPL

00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,800
enforcement project for Linux at

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,970
Conservancy who insist on anonymity

00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,440
because they are terrified it will

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,330
affect their ability to get jobs and

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,710
other things if they're even heard to be

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:07,480
talking to people who do enforcement I

00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:09,160
think what's happened is that the people

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,130
who have always been against copyleft

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,930
subtly and quietly now see there's some

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,850
chinks in the armor there are very few

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,740
people still enforcing the copyleft the

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,360
only two organizations doing it as a

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,870
part of a charity or the FSF and

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,340
Conservancy it's a time for the Sharks

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,900
to circle and see if they can finish off

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:29,650
the rest that's what I think is

00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:31,030
happening now this matters to you I mean

00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,810
even if you don't care that much about

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,360
copyleft

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:38,230
it matters and blunt to was violating

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,540
your copyrights for two years they had a

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,570
trademark policy that contradicted the

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,980
GPL it's a violation the GPL Free

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,610
Software Foundation and Conservancy

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,980
worked very very hard for two years to

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,810
get it resolved it's been resolved the

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,070
trademark policy as it stands you can

00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,950
read the statements on both

00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:00,820
conservancies and FSF's websites are in

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:02,590
compliance with the GPL so I'm glad the

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,570
canonical limited eventually did the

00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,790
right thing however you've got to read

00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,070
the fine print because what they've done

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:13,390
is they've said well by using this Trump

00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:17,050
Clause thing to comply it means that all

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:18,670
the non copy lefted software from Debian

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:22,839
which of course then ends up in a bun -

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:24,280
is then proprietor eyes effectively when

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,930
it goes into a bun tube because all

00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,410
these additional restrictions and terms

00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,970
in the trademark policy that are

00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,950
contradictory - copyleft the trump

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,170
clause passes them out for copyleft so

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,300
you can't have those contradicting

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,880
copyleft but they happily don't

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,430
contradict the two clause bsd license or

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,760
the apache software license or various

00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:46,930
other

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,640
licenses so a lot a lot is being

00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,920
proprietor eyes now it's totally

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,780
permissible by the copyright license but

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,460
I would encourage everybody in the

00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,340
Debian community think about how much

00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,960
you like that because your goal is to

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,610
make everything in Maine to be DFS

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,500
g-free but when it gets into a bun to

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,320
Maine it automatically if it's not copy

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,090
lefted become falls under this trademark

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,160
policy that's unfriendly to free

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:13,240
software and I would argue DFS G non

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:16,300
free I think we're facing some really

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,660
tough challenges I believe free software

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,340
has been largely co-opted by for-profit

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,780
companies that's why I still say free

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,730
software and not open-source because I

00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:28,360
think open-source I actually agree with

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:31,480
RMS about this is a term that allows

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,790
companies to take the good parts they

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,350
want from free software and leave the

00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,540
political stuff that many of us care

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:40,960
about and still be able to exploit it

00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:43,960
for their own purposes meanwhile Debian

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,240
is a hugely important political part of

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,610
what's happening because Debian is this

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,900
really important non-commercial project

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,220
probably the largest non-commercial

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,600
project of its kind that's still

00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,180
extremely relevant in the free software

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,910
community and your long history and your

00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,830
good governance had insulated you from a

00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,500
lot of these politics that have happened

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,420
in other projects what's happened to

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,190
OpenStack would never happen to Debian

00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,140
because you're all too old for it

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,640
happened to you it's it's just kind of

00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,960
nice that it works out that way some

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,640
usefulness and being old but but

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,130
eventually the pressure will catch up to

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,070
you somebody's gonna do it canonical

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:26,020
just tried it and didn't succeed thanks

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,490
to the fact that we stopped them but

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,460
someone else will come along and try to

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:33,240
do it next I think it's just a harbinger

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,410
of things to come at this point and

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,440
copyleft is gonna matter more and more

00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:41,380
to Debian as time goes on because it is

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:46,720
the thing standing between these kinds

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:49,000
of maneuvers and free software I always

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,970
see Debian as a key building block of

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,400
other free software people build stuff

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,690
on top of Debian all the time I find in

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,760
my work investigating GPL viola

00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,950
plenty of times where it's a Debian

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,020
system they just took and then gave no

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:07,550
source code and moved and moved it into

00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:09,080
a product and are violating the GPL that

00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,520
means that people who are powerful and

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,920
corrupt will want to control it because

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,260
it's essential and if they could somehow

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,450
take control of Debian they could

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,770
control a lot of the software world

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,110
I think they can't get control of you

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,460
because of the way you're organized but

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:27,290
that doesn't mean they're not going to

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:29,360
try now I think that is so successful

00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:33,020
because Debian has always been about

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,640
people the the the decision to make the

00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,870
Debian developer and I know it's

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,030
different now but originally was the

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,530
Debian developer was the pinnacle of how

00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,570
you became part of this community you

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,310
passed your Debian developer stuff which

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:47,030
I've never been able to pass because

00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:50,360
some lame but I always believed that

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:52,850
that people oriented manner of operating

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,890
was essential to how that worked now

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,240
since that first Deb Kampf I admit I

00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,100
have not spent much of my time with

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,810
developers certainly not as much as I

00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,490
would have liked I spend most of my time

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:05,750
around lawyers and businesspeople in the

00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:08,090
last thirteen or fourteen years and they

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:11,480
would look at Debian or in fact any free

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:13,940
software very differently most of these

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,200
people look at it not about the people

00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,490
they see people is basically fungible

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,310
any developers good is the next right

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,560
from a business person's perspective but

00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,630
the assets that sit there things like

00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,360
copyrights that they look at as the

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:33,470
output of Debian the value that Debian

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,330
generates and there is a certain

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,890
technical correctness to that right

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,180
until you it's kind of like until you

00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,790
write something down it doesn't exist

00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,800
kind of thing so the fact that Debian

00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,080
generates copyrights as you all are

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,420
doing your work packaging packages

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,820
writing documentation everything that

00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,620
you do that's the record of what you did

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,080
which is then copy writable so that so

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,380
there's a certain logic to this lawyers

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,790
way of looking at Debian to say oh it's

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,170
just the assets that it's a trade some

00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:05,060
trademarks it's some copyrights

00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:06,290
yada yada yada what I think you all

00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,370
should think about in response to that I

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,990
said well maybe there's some value to

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,410
that maybe we should leverage the assets

00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,160
we

00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:15,370
as a way to fight for ourselves fight

00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:18,320
for a good cause of free software

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,780
there's one way to look at copyleft is

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,300
is really and this is one I like almost

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,310
the best is that it's really just a

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,930
mechanism to leverage assets which lots

00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:30,440
of us agree shouldn't exist I'm not a

00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:33,530
fan of copyright by any means but you

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,270
take those assets that are forced upon

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,210
you basically by the system we live in

00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,490
and try to utilize them in some novel

00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,280
way to maximize fairness and goodness

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,990
and benefit to other people or NSA years

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,240
ago with Richard Stallman about this

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,220
about how the power to choose a license

00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,740
on software is this inappropriate power

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,340
that people shouldn't get they get it

00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,900
anyway

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,290
so the only thing we can do is make a

00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,550
good choice about our licenses to

00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,880
neutralize the power that we should

00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:03,020
never have been given to start with I

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,030
often talk about this is using the tools

00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:09,290
of the oppressor against the oppressor

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:11,060
and if we're gonna do that that means we

00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:14,000
have to look at every tool they use with

00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:16,220
regard to copyright we've generally just

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,200
looked at the licensing tool the tool of

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,130
what license do I put on my software

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,630
that's how I'll do it I'll put a

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,820
copyleft license so that I'm defending

00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,980
software freedom by putting a copyleft

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,480
license on my code but I think Debian

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,420
could go even further and use these

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,930
tools in additional ways to help defend

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:35,090
software freedom and with that I'd like

00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:37,310
to announce a thing that Conservancy is

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,350
doing for Debian this was officially put

00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,060
into place in April we waited to

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,470
announce it until my keynote here

00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:46,610
because we knew I was going to be

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:48,560
keynoting and is agreement that's been

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,990
signed between the DPL and the

00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,090
Conservancy to offer the following

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,650
services to the Debian project all of

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,500
which are optional to all Debian

00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,670
developers so as a program begun as

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,650
under the software freedom Conservancy

00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:04,070
we recognize that it's a member of SPI

00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,780
we asked SPI if it was okay if we did

00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,280
this before we did it because we wanted

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,040
to make sure we were offending your

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,300
other charity organization in the United

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,840
States and they agreed that this was

00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:19,220
fine it permits any Debian developer who

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:22,100
would like to to optionally or and in a

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,840
configurable way assign any copyrights

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,370
in there dead

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,010
related works the Conservancy if they

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,080
would like to if they don't want to do

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,060
that it also permits them if they would

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,610
like to sign an enforcement agreement

00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:36,250
with Conservancy to ask Conservancy to

00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:38,200
enforce free software licenses on behalf

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,670
of that developer and that's an

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,660
agreement that we can cancel I'll talk

00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,510
more about that in a minute

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,830
and probably of the most interest to a

00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,990
lot of you because it's going to come up

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,320
the most often is Conservancy will

00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:53,320
provide licensing support and advice on

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,240
an ongoing basis for the Debian project

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,420
and I'll talk more later about how we're

00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,430
going to do that and the whole reason

00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,530
this exists is because a key Debian

00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:04,540
katroo contributor came to us and asked

00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,250
us to do it and we were happy to do it

00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,890
and I'll talk about that wasn't a few

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,600
minutes but first I felt I have to talk

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,280
about this right because I've spent a

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,220
lot of years lately in fact the last

00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,450
time I was in Germany I was here to

00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,090
debate Mark Shuttleworth

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,080
about copyright assignment so the fact

00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,430
that I've just pitched you that

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,600
copyright assignment is now available

00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,400
for Debian developers I'm sure is

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,520
probably leaving you to wonder a little

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,490
bit and it's certainly true that the

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,070
kinds of problems I'm talking about

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:34,000
sometimes come out from the fact that

00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,010
for-profit companies come to free

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,540
software developers and convinced them

00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:40,150
to assign their copyrights to that

00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,100
company or they ask them to sign some

00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,140
heavy weight contributor license

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,850
agreement which is the almost legal

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,880
identical effect to a copyright

00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:52,570
assignment and the reason they do that

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,550
is because they want to usually make

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,160
proprietary versions of those

00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,930
copyrighted works or otherwise exploit

00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,310
them in some way that the free software

00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:02,650
license that they would have gotten

00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:05,890
anyway would not allow them to do I

00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:08,560
began stall of that I'm opposed to using

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,660
copyright assignment in that way but

00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,610
then when I think about the original

00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,380
notification motivations of copyleft it

00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,980
always was using tools that we were not

00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:20,770
totally comfortable with existing at all

00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:22,660
against themselves and so why not look

00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:24,730
at copyright assignment this way if you

00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,560
only assign your copyright to charities

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,560
that take a good strong stand for

00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,080
software freedom you'll be able to

00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,900
actually maximize the benefit of your

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,610
copyright it's allowing a organization

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,260
that say enforcing the GPL

00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,730
or otherwise trying to do the right

00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,760
things with those copyrights to advance

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:45,250
software freedom you can help that work

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,900
along by doing it the other point I want

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,750
to make is the only reason those

00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,820
nefarious uses of copyrighted sement can

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,740
ever work is because they collect a

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,720
hundred percent of the copyrights I

00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,820
think no project should have

00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,360
consolidated copyright at 100 percent

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,340
anymore

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,799
I think that's an antiquated way of

00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:05,049
thinking so I would encourage Debian to

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,760
have multi copyright held forever which

00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,860
it probably will there will never be a

00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,960
single copyright holder of Debian I'm

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,280
sure or even if you just took the parts

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,630
that Debian developers have contributed

00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,880
not all of them are going to assign to

00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,650
one entity so even if a few Debian

00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,929
developers assigned to Conservancy or

00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,669
many there will still be a nice diverse

00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:26,770
copyright base which I think creates a

00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:29,260
healthy community and it comes down to

00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:31,480
it there's a very sad but but simply

00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,130
true reason that copyright assignment is

00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,559
important this is from the Debian

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:38,620
history file we've lost people in our

00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:41,169
community we will lose more as time goes

00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,120
on most of this community is very young

00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:48,220
but I'm aging we're all aging at the

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,360
same same rate more or less and I think

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,549
you need to think about that question

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,410
what happens if something happens to me

00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:54,700
what happens to my contributions to the

00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:57,700
community what do they do where do they

00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,980
go and I think we should think about

00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,200
that I've had to talk to developers

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,150
errors on the phone to get licensing

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,530
problems it's one of the most horrible

00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:10,120
things I've ever had to do on my job and

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,830
think for yourself about do you want

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,280
your heirs or people who are in charge

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:18,220
of your copyrights when you pass having

00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,260
to do that the only more I guess less

00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,450
sad problem is people forget to take

00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,650
care of things and they put them off

00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,110
especially when they're boring and

00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:28,440
annoying so things like copyright

00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:32,500
enforcement they're copyleft enforcement

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,910
tends not to happen I know from my years

00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,320
and years of experience doing it that

00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,030
there are constantly hundreds and

00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,100
hundreds of violations all the time all

00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:41,740
of them are urgent more or less because

00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,510
they're all really hurting users and I

00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:47,160
don't know about you but when you have a

00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:48,820
bug queue where every single bug is

00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,650
critical

00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,650
none of them are critical right because

00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,550
then it's like it's over the project is

00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,830
screwed

00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,140
that's how GPL enforcement has felt for

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,730
years and years and years so while you

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,170
can think about having their own

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,640
copyrights as well it's my privilege to

00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,770
have my own copyrights and use them it's

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,720
actually also a burden because if you

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:10,750
care about the license you chose and

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,640
people are ignoring it broadly all

00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,680
around the world all the time violating

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,120
the copyleft or even if it's a I see

00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,580
lots of violations of non copyleft

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,640
licenses to you you don't have a

00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,350
mandatory requirement to enforce but if

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,000
you cared about the license you kind of

00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,500
should be feeling gee I should take care

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,550
of that make sure that the license is

00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:32,680
respected and that's why a Gregorio it

00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,210
might be better to aggregate the

00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,090
copyright somewhere where people are

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:40,540
trying to do the work of enforcing the

00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,500
copyleft licenses and I don't think you

00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,120
should be ashamed if you want to be

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,860
unburdened I think that if you feel like

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,270
look I care about the license I chose

00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,400
but I really want somebody else to

00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:51,490
handle the copyrights there are other

00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,980
people who feel this way to stuff stuff

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,900
at home as a Corolla was the first to

00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,010
sign up into the aggregation project

00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,410
yesterday

00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:01,870
Zack assigned all of his past and future

00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:04,660
contributions to Debian to the software

00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:07,030
freedom Conservancy I can't think of a

00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,500
better endorsement I'm honored that Zack

00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,330
is going to trust the organization that

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,040
I work for with taking care of his

00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:15,580
copyrights taking care of copyleft on

00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,950
his behalf and he gave me this quote

00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,430
which I'll just let you read do you want

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:23,380
to read it out loud

00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:24,790
Zakhar no please no he says I'm not

00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,480
gonna make him come to them to the mic

00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:30,940
and read it and he's not the only person

00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,560
Paul tagged choose chose the kind of

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,180
optional like choose what you want to

00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,910
assign he assigned a few things from

00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,740
from what he's worked on in Debian to

00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:42,430
Conservancy I forget what it was but he

00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,750
can tell you if you want to ask him I he

00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,040
listed them off to me at lunch since a

00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,560
few minutes ago and they've already left

00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,120
my brain I apologize I read them too and

00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,030
they left my brain too I didn't get much

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,040
sleep of a plane that I mentioned and he

00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,450
also provided a quote that he wanted to

00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,130
share with you about how he feels about

00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,130
this new initiative that we're doing

00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:06,150
and there are others who are talking

00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:08,100
about signing and I was really glad that

00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,750
Clint just agreed at lunch that he does

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,179
he does he hasn't done yet but he plans

00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:14,670
to and he's very he's actually like me

00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,740
he's very anti CLA anti-copyright

00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,929
assignment agreement but I think the

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,640
distinction between assigning to a

00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:22,679
charity and assigning to a company is

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,200
different and so I think there is a lot

00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,250
of value there but I also want to talk

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
about the other things we're doing other

00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,280
than that I'm really excited about this

00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,720
program I know I don't sound excited

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,130
because I feel like the problems that

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,540
solving are very grave so I sound like a

00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,919
really like this is urgent and my voice

00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,929
because I think it's urgent that we deal

00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,720
with the problems that this program

00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:41,309
seeks to address but we've created a

00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,760
bunch of different interesting ways to

00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:44,250
do it

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,020
Conservancy already had this problem

00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,850
before where people were like well I

00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,799
care about the GPL but I don't want to

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,090
sign copyright to anyone is there

00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,320
another way we can get enforcement done

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:55,260
it's another way we can make sure

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,210
copyleft is upheld and for the samba

00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,860
project for a busybox project for the

00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,360
GPL compliance project for linux

00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:03,929
developers we already have these things

00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,179
called enforcement agreements and what

00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:08,100
it is is an agreement between the

00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,299
individual and the organization that the

00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,340
organization will act as their

00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:13,200
enforcement agent to go out there and

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,299
ensure that the copyleft is complies a

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,309
copyleft license of the project is

00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:18,960
complied with and they're accountable

00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:21,450
agreements so if you decide that

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,860
Conservancy is gone crazy and is doing

00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,929
the wrong things you cancel the MOU 30

00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,510
days notice and that Conservancy is no

00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:28,590
longer your enforcement agent I will

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,059
have these pretty now I think I've been

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,919
print out yet but I will have them print

00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,360
out about Deb comp if you want to look

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,720
them over and sign them and I can even

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,460
we can email them to you as well but

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,169
before I go to questions I also want to

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,669
talk about this part of it because I

00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:44,280
actually think this was this was one of

00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:46,830
the major requests that VPL had for us

00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,960
about what it's actually the previous

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:54,090
DPL Lucas that we negotiate all this

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:57,059
with they there was a really big concern

00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:59,130
that Debian doesn't have access to

00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:01,770
licensing policy advice on a regular

00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:04,740
basis in a committed way with an

00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,150
agreement so we agreed we actually we

00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,200
had a lot of debate inside Conservancy

00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,220
about this because we're a small

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,770
organization we only have three people

00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,220
on staff but we felt Debian was

00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:14,400
important

00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,990
we agreed four hours a month sorry no

00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,030
rollover minutes that doesn't add up

00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:20,160
but four hours a month we can take

00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,930
questions from the Debian community

00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,950
about licensing and so forth obviously

00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,900
what these be funneled through the

00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,930
leadership so we don't just we're not

00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,570
gonna answer Debian legal is what I mean

00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:34,710
but I mean I'm on it but I only post

00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:36,540
when I really get trolled bad but but if

00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:39,750
if there are questions officially coming

00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:41,400
from Debian that about licensing policy

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,750
those sorts of things Conservancy can

00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,160
answer that and so that's going to be

00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:48,000
part of the service that we're going to

00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,680
be offering Debian and so I'm really

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,050
excited about our ability to do that and

00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,550
it's gonna be work for us but your whole

00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:57,720
probably in a minute sign but I can't

00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:59,280
read it then okay okay I have 26 on my

00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,640
back that's fine I'll be done soon

00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,230
and Karen Sandler and I who both worked

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,060
for Conservancy where we're two of the

00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,890
experts in free software licensing so

00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:12,450
I'm really glad to be able to give

00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:13,530
something back to Debian because I was

00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:16,410
worried I was gonna get a motion on this

00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:17,850
side I tried to become a Debian

00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:20,720
developer a long time ago I never had

00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:23,280
time to actually work my thing and I

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,530
haven't always used Debian this is my

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,510
distribution history but I've spent more

00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:34,620
time using Debian than anything else and

00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:36,180
I and I want to thank everybody for all

00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,160
the work that you've done I wake up

00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,440
every morning and i unlock my screen and

00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,940
I see the swirl and I don't have to

00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,860
think about my operating system all day

00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,960
and those of you who are software

00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,730
developers know that when you make

00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,770
software that your user can use and not

00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:51,420
think about that's a true success of

00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:53,580
software development

00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:55,440
Debian just works for me every day and

00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,030
I'm not really a foam but I have a phone

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,350
but I mostly I want a laptop in a

00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,890
keyboard I can type on and that laptop

00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:04,260
is running Debian and I couldn't do my

00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:07,020
work without everything you do I feel

00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,430
like you're all my friends who are just

00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,020
making sure that I have everything I

00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:15,099
need to get my

00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,099
[Applause]

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:26,109
and the idea that I can that we can do

00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:28,490
this project and give something back

00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:31,460
which I know some of you are gonna want

00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:32,750
and some of you won't but I'm so glad to

00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,700
finally have something that I can get

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,740
back to Debbie and then do some work to

00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:40,579
help Debian and if there's anything else

00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,990
you want that I know how to do or my

00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:44,809
colleagues at Conservancy know how to do

00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:46,369
ask us cuz I want us to be able to do

00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:49,160
more for you because you've done so much

00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:53,380
for free software and for me personally

00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,380
- thank you

00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,670
so I think you can line up here for

00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,079
questions and there's gonna be like

00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,039
questions popping up on the screen from

00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,989
the other room or something I'm supposed

00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,549
to look for I think that sound supposed

00:36:09,989 --> 00:36:13,410
to work so you're supposed to wind up I

00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:20,249
think supporter questions please go to

00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:22,789
the microphone in the middle o doubt

00:36:20,249 --> 00:36:25,109
there'll be a I want to sign up for your

00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:28,190
enforcement thing also can I leave my

00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:28,190
copyright to you in my will

00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:35,609
Karen Karen has actually been working on

00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:37,380
that question for 10 years it's actually

00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:39,719
much harder than you think

00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,489
and she could explain to you all the

00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,599
reasons why I was on the phone with her

00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:44,369
I knew I was gonna get those questions I

00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,589
was on the phone with her on one of my I

00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,849
think my layover or something asking her

00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:50,009
and she starts listing off all these

00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:51,630
legal problems with doing it and I had

00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:53,670
like slept like two hours in the last

00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:55,440
fourteen or something or 25 something

00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,239
like that and so I was not really

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,579
following all the stuff there's things

00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:01,619
like it has to be evaluated and your

00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,209
heirs can fight over the valuation and

00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:06,359
all that it's crazy and it's different

00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:09,029
every jurisdiction she's got a couple of

00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:11,999
different ideas of the estate planning

00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:13,920
copyright thing we don't have a solution

00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:15,930
for it yet one of the reasons we didn't

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,549
announce the project back when the DPL

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,809
signed the agreement in April was

00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:20,910
because we were working we were looking

00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:22,410
at that problem and we don't have a

00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,519
solution for it still but we decided to

00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,749
proceed with the agreements we have

00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,180
we've got it we've got a cup of regular

00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:29,130
copyright time agreement both an EU one

00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,469
that's been vetted by EU Council so that

00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,809
it's like copper II assignment from and

00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:36,119
from a European person to a u.s. entity

00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:39,180
is complicated and weird but we've got a

00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,829
vetted EU agreement by European lawyer

00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,329
that we believe will work we've got a

00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:43,650
u.s. one we've got the enforcement

00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:45,239
agreement which I think is one you were

00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,359
interested in so we have those three now

00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:49,680
I agree with you we need that for it the

00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,569
whole free software community needs that

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,069
and I think we're committed to working

00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,680
on a solution I don't have a timeframe

00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:56,519
because the problems are so complicated

00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,349
that's the best I could tell you now

00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:59,579
it's not a great answer but we have

00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:02,519
thought about it and we've worked on it

00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:04,769
for a long time that hope okay thank you

00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:05,789
maybe I'll talk to my own lawyer yeah

00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:07,349
well I actually if you learn anything

00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:09,420
share it with us right if they're if

00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:10,769
they they find a solution maybe one that

00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,610
just works in your jurisdiction we'll

00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:14,350
have one for your jurisdiction right

00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:16,270
if your lawyer finds one certainly if

00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,350
you want a fun legal help that will pass

00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:22,260
information to us that would be

00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:22,260
wonderful thank you

00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:28,570
my question is could you just say a bit

00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,280
more about this enforcement option which

00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,830
is just passed by so far because the

00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,570
things that was it quite interesting yes

00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:37,180
so so we've done a lot of these

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:38,590
agreements and we'll probably and the

00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:41,080
agreements we just finalized in this

00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:42,730
week because various reasons you know

00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,060
it's deadline we got up to the deadline

00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:48,070
but the the enforcement option the basic

00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,410
way that it works is you sign an

00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:52,480
agreement that simply appoints

00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,420
conservancy as your agent to go and do

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,160
certain activities which include

00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,740
contacting violators of the license

00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,300
negotiating with them to agreements it

00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,950
doesn't go as far as litigation so it

00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,690
specifically says that litigation would

00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,040
have to be a separate agreement we never

00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,780
want to be litigating on behalf of

00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,250
somebody willy nilly we'd want to go

00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,510
back to the person and talk to them

00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:14,200
so basically everything up to but not

00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:15,910
including litigation 30 days cancel so

00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,070
that if you decide wait I don't like

00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,980
what you're doing cancel in 30 days so I

00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:23,140
will talk to Tennille I guess and figure

00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,700
out where the best place to post these

00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,440
agreements are and how to handle if

00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,670
their I didn't I don't know I we weren't

00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,400
sure how much interest is gonna be you

00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,570
know I know people I don't know a lot of

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,370
people do want this I know some people

00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,260
don't so if there's a ton of interest

00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,850
we'll figure out a more streamlined way

00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,020
to get it done if there's a little bit

00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,940
of interest I could just talk to each of

00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,530
you individually about what your needs

00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,790
are and we can treat everybody like a

00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,400
special stuff like that's I know that

00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:49,510
we're very Debian way to do things right

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:52,480
so once we come to our saying over to

00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:55,210
you what can we do to

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,880
if you go bad or if you die and your

00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:00,609
successor doesn't really follow up with

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,730
the spirit of the original thought of

00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:06,819
Sanka variety you and so on how do you

00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:08,859
reduce or how do you keep your own

00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:12,369
attack surface in check so you are not

00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:14,559
taking over and all things come down the

00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:16,299
drain in one go yeah I mean that's

00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,890
that's the typical criticism that

00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:20,049
copyright assignment gets this is why I

00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:22,329
make the distinction between assigning

00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:24,130
copyright to a charity and assigning to

00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:26,619
a corporate entity that can be sold a

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,240
charity can't be sold in fact in the

00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:29,559
United States I mean I'd like the

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,019
charity law I know there's charities

00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:33,549
laws in every country the charity laws

00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:35,920
in the US are kind of neat because they

00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:38,950
call it the the it's from the tax code

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,240
in the US the 501c3 black hole and the

00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:42,430
reason they call it that is because once

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,799
something's in one of these charities it

00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:47,920
can never go to a non charity and the

00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:50,140
IRS in the United States requires that

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,510
charities always act for the public's

00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,700
benefit so I've always argued that for

00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,619
example if a charity went rogue did the

00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,240
wrong thing and this is true is true for

00:40:56,619 --> 00:41:00,539
the upset as it would be for Conservancy

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,769
under this program people can file a

00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:04,869
class-action lawsuit as copyright

00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:07,119
assignors saying I assigned under the

00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:08,079
belief I was signing to a organization

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,630
that was going to act in the public

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,369
benefit and I believe it's not using my

00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,779
copyrights in the public benefit now

00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:16,000
that would be a long drawn-out

00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:19,180
protracted process to solve the problem

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,609
I agree completely the implication of

00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,289
your question which is that ultimately

00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:26,019
copyright assignment is a trust

00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:27,940
agreement that's relatively permanent so

00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:30,160
you're basically trusting that entity to

00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,869
do the right thing forever and you don't

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,009
know who's gonna be elected on the board

00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:36,069
of directors and all that sort of thing

00:41:33,009 --> 00:41:37,930
that's why we want to offer multiple

00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:41,259
options because we know that that trust

00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:42,609
is very hard to get to and and some

00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:43,930
people trust organization I've assigned

00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:45,730
some of my copyrights to the up stuff

00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:46,930
because I trust the FSF and that was

00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,430
before I was on the board of directors

00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:51,039
the up staff so it was it was a time

00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:52,839
when I actually had to trust it so I I

00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,250
think that if you don't trust our

00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:55,809
organization you don't trust the up

00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,059
stuff you shouldn't assign copyrights to

00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:58,990
them and that's my personal position

00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:00,490
that's why we do the enforcement

00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,259
agreements we had these same

00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:04,119
conversations with people in the busybox

00:42:02,259 --> 00:42:05,950
project I mean it's funny Eric Anderson

00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:09,310
who I've done enforcement work

00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:11,050
since the early 2000s he's done

00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:13,780
enforcement work with me across three

00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:15,369
different entities and has kept his own

00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,320
copyrights because he always wanted to

00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:19,030
do his own enforcement so it's always

00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,829
been an enforcement agreement as opposed

00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,869
to an assignment I would expect that's

00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:25,150
going to be the more popular option it

00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:26,980
was actually that to be I'm gonna sorry

00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,420
Zack it was Zack who insisted we have to

00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,990
operate assignment right I want to be

00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,160
clear about that

00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,770
yeah I mean I'm right about that I mean

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,210
Zack Zack really felt as an option that

00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,980
it had to be an option on the table I

00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,520
actually argued that maybe we nobody

00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,079
would want it

00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,190
I said well everybody hates copyright

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,210
assignment right I mean that's been my

00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,270
position too this whole conversation

00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:44,980
internally and Zack really thought it

00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:47,050
should be an option because it because

00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,609
there are people and Zacks argument was

00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,780
I mean that that burden thing is more or

00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:51,310
less X I mean it's basically your

00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,440
argument is that it's a burden to have

00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:55,660
copyrights you have to keep track and

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,240
you have to care about the license of

00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,710
violations and so that burden argument I

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,300
think is compelling if you really don't

00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,440
want the burden he's like I just want to

00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,730
make sure somebody's taken care of this

00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,099
so I'm never gonna pay attention to it

00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,540
myself I think that's when you would

00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:09,400
want it otherwise you probably just the

00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,660
enforcement agreement I III like the

00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,310
enforcement agreements we have these

00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,720
mailing lists internally of everybody

00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,280
who's signed one that we talk about

00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,349
every violation matters so it's kind of

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,200
a community of itself a private one but

00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:21,280
but a community nonetheless so I just

00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,430
take the next question somebody's

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,099
telling me to take the next question how

00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:31,000
to compare sort of Friedman's version

00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:32,980
with GPL violations well the easy

00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,940
comparison is GPL violations doesn't

00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:39,069
exist anymore and Conservancy does

00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:41,020
Harold Harold was basically the primary

00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:43,180
force behind GPL violations that org

00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,410
you'll notice the websites been gone for

00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,900
six months now

00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,819
and he hasn't been working on

00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,930
enforcement himself for a thing two

00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:54,780
years maybe three at this point

00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:57,099
enforcement see the thing the thing is I

00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,930
get two reactions about enforcement

00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:00,490
people either think it's really cool or

00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:03,040
they think I'm like totally evil for

00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:03,970
doing it but I think it's but if it is

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,470
really cool they're like all you do

00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:07,260
enforcement you you go in there and get

00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:10,329
the compliance like I'm some sort of

00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:12,369
Marvel superhero or something right but

00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:14,470
it's nothing like that it's sitting on

00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:16,480
conference calls with people who do not

00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,750
understand the license do not did not

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,420
know GPL software was in there

00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:23,790
and explain to them in gory detail the

00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,410
same questions over and over again but

00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,090
you can't just send them an FAQ because

00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,740
they just ignore it so you have to sit

00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:30,690
there and handhold them all the way

00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,460
through the process and try to get their

00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:34,950
source code to compile which it doesn't

00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,440
over and over again until it finally

00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:39,690
builds and then you say okay it builds

00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,359
now so it's just made it it's finally

00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:45,840
compliant with the GPL and doing that is

00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:47,400
not enjoyable and so and so Harold got

00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,290
sick of doing that he wants to be a

00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,330
developer not a GPL enforcer for a

00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:52,020
living and so that's why it doesn't

00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,849
exist anymore

00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,740
I really respect Harold's work actually

00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:57,390
Harold is the person that convinced me

00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,310
we should sue people I used to think we

00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,780
should never sue anybody over GPL and

00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,940
how until want to convince me that if

00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,230
you don't sue there's basically no

00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,480
consequence all you have to do is

00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,650
violate the GPL wait for somebody to

00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,270
contact you and then you come into

00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,340
compliance so why would anybody come

00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,390
into compliance if their nefarious from

00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,500
the beginning they just say well when

00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:15,170
somebody calls me I'll come into

00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,150
compliance otherwise I'll just violate

00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:20,040
the threat of a lawsuit and having that

00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:22,470
truck be real is the only way to get to

00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,750
get people to comply voluntarily because

00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,430
they fear a lawsuit and how old is the

00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:29,609
one that taught all of us that and so

00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:31,980
his work is so seminal and essential but

00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:37,320
it's also over so does that answer

00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:38,940
question one more question

00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:43,890
there's only one person in line that's

00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:46,080
perfect so if someone assigns you the

00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:51,480
copy why not me personally well your

00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:54,780
group your Conservancy what's the common

00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:58,770
workflow is there workflow at all needed

00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:02,640
to change the copy rights of that person

00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:05,490
in all the projects the person was a

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,440
Warsaw is involved you mean literally

00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:10,050
changing copyright notices you mean yep

00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,880
you really don't have to I don't know of

00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,560
any jurisdiction where you're legally

00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,140
required to change a copyright notice

00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,330
after assignment you certainly can

00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,640
change it the copyright notice is

00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:22,200
inaccurate but there are thousands and

00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,060
thousands of inaccurate copyright

00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,280
notices all over every free software

00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,740
project certainly me I know the us the

00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,440
best certainly in the US there's no real

00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,800
problem or issue with enforcing over

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,690
copier

00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,640
rights what we would do in a lawsuit if

00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,080
it came to that for example we just

00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,700
produced your copyright assignment

00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,900
agreement and say well those copyrights

00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,700
that you're seeing with your name on it

00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,320
or deny ours over under this agreement

00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:47,790
and then it would be done that will be

00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:49,410
the only thanks all right so we're done

00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:51,060
what sigh I said I can't read the signs

00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:53,220
I don't know whether to my bad eyes or

00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:55,580
the reflection but it probably says get

00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,580
off the stage

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:11,070
