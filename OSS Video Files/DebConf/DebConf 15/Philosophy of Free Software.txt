As a community, Debian is driven by many passions, but none so deep and lasting as the philosophy of Free Software. Born in an era of increasing social freedom but increasing political and corporate conservatism, Free Software didn't begin as a rebellion against an entrenched proprietary majority, but more as a jolt of surprise that earlier attitudes of open collaboration were disappearing. Academic experimentation gave way to the "Big Business" of software, and to economic motivations to lock down legal ownership. Until the 1970's, the United States considered software as a "utilitarian good" and granted it no copyright protection. Free Software and proprietary software grew more-or-less at the same time, in response to new ideas of software as a creative work, due the same treatment as other forms of property.

Free Software has always been firmly planted in the ideals of freedom, liberty, equality, and a society of individuals working toward a common good. These concepts are steeped in a heritage stretching back centuries, including Socrates, Plato, Scotus, John Locke, Thomas Paine, Thomas Hill Green, and numerous others. This talk explores the philosophical roots of Free Software, for a deeper understanding of the movement today.

that's working okay so welcome everybody

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,840
to our next featured speaker it's Alison

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,610
Randall and she will talk about the

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:22,100
philosophy of free software so welcome

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:24,960
her please so a few words of warning

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,240
this is not a comprehensive history of

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,740
philosophy I'm gonna cover a little over

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,560
two thousand years of history in 20

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,170
minutes so it's very light on details

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,270
and I'm not endorsing the views of any

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,100
particular philosopher that I mentioned

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,559
many of them believed very crazy things

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,300
that like slavery was good and women

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,070
we're equivalent to property and all

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,340
sorts of other things so just because I

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,120
mentioned some idea here that seems very

00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,370
interesting and you want to delve more

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,110
deeply you may find things in their

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,760
belief system that you absolutely do not

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,260
agree with I am NOT so grouping by

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,550
chronology I'm not grouping by topic so

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,170
things are gonna jump around a lot

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,270
you're gonna see a lot of skipping

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,309
threads here and there so what I'm kind

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,950
of trying to trace is the development of

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,369
ideas through time and a few ideas that

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,680
I want you to keep an eye out for our

00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:16,049
freedom rights as in human rights

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,540
individual rights the rights of social

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,180
units or societies or States or

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,100
governments and then also what's right

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,430
as in what's right or wrong or good or

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,259
bad and then all the concept of property

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,630
because that kind of leads into the

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:36,360
concept of software as I get to free

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:39,090
software towards the end so most of this

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,400
talk talks about Western philosophy but

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,229
I want to do a very brief bit on eastern

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,049
philosophy because it predates Western

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:49,170
philosophy a few ideas that kind of feed

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,909
into the later developments so buddha

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,280
believed that suffering suffering was

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,890
universal and it was really in your mind

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,350
you caused it through your own complex

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,420
thoughts and could be liberated from

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,890
suffering by doing what's right where

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,469
what's right has a whole array of pieces

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,970
in the way that humans live that was

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:14,410
that were outlined in in great detail

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:18,860
Confucius he had an emphasis on

00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:22,070
humanness and culture and doing what's

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,110
right and one of the things that that he

00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,060
that sort of go through his teaching is

00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,130
the idea that you know property is

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,170
important but humans are more important

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,700
human life is more important and the

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:37,190
rights of humans is more important than

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:39,590
property Heraclitus he believed in

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,590
constant change all things around us are

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,660
changing constantly he also believed

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,830
that there was a sort of a fundamental

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:53,870
law a truth behind all laws that that

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:55,550
humans expressed Socrates we don't

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,770
actually know very much about Socrates

00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,770
because only Plato ever wrote down

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,540
things that he supposedly said but some

00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,200
ideas we can pick up from him

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,430
he believed that the value of craft or

00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,820
techne which is where we get the word

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,220
technology was is in its benefit to

00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,959
users and not in how much money you

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,430
could make off of it he considered

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,019
making money to be a different skill but

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,290
that was not related to how you evaluate

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,630
technique and he also had an idea that

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,390
there was kind of a there was a right

00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:29,180
and wrong there was a good that was

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:31,100
independent of when his case it was

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,950
independent of divinity he had one of

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:37,190
his one of the the great debates that

00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,750
Plato recorded is around so is something

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,550
right because the gods tell us it's

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,200
right or is it actually fundamentally

00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,060
right and that's why the gods are

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,150
telling us that and he concluded it's

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,799
that there's a fundamental right nests

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:53,299
and even if the gods told us that lying

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,100
was good it still wouldn't be Plato was

00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,380
a student of Socrates and he kind of

00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:01,220
took this fundamental nature of things a

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,799
bit farther into almost a concept of

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,110
classes and objects that you know you'd

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,400
have an abstract idea of a dog and then

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,590
you would have all these instances of

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,720
dogs in the world but the true nature of

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,380
a dog is that abstract idea

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,989
so the fundamental truth he believed

00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,729
that human beings came together to form

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,220
societies in order to meet their needs

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:24,860
and that one of those needs that was met

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,000
through forming societies was justice to

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,370
avoid oppression

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,290
he was a big fan of philosopher Kings

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,480
what we would call benevolent dictators

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,190
highly enlightened human beings who

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,110
would have absolute power and make

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,860
society good because of using that power

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:44,280
well he also believed in constant legal

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,010
reform that since the laws were only

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,970
there to meet the needs of human beings

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,620
and of course you would have to

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,810
constantly revise them so they would

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,080
more accurately meet the needs of human

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,080
beings

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,430
Diogenes actually was around the same

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,870
time as Plato but he was an active

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,750
critic of Plato because he said that

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,240
creative Plato was entirely

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,370
misrepresenting Socrates yet through the

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,169
writings but really the only recording

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,260
we have of Socrates is through Plato's

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,540
writings he believed that individual

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,880
freedom wasn't was a much more important

00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,370
value than the traditional hierarchy but

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,560
he also believed that there was sort of

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,980
a universal sense of right and wrong

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,660
that was not defined by culture or the

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:33,000
particular context that you're in right

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:35,370
now Aristotle was a student of Plato and

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,800
he believed that individuals should be

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,660
able to own property but they should

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,790
always should always be shared so you

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,970
get this sort of pride of ownership but

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,530
then the pleasure of sharing with others

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,930
he believed that societies were formed

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,479
to respect rights and he believed that

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,850
doing right is sort of the proper

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,919
function of a human being like you might

00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,200
say the proper function of a hammer is

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:02,940
to hit a nail sort of doing right is the

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,500
proper function of human being and then

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,840
we kind of skip a few years because they

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,510
went off into this strange tangent where

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,430
the question was whether your life was

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,840
entirely dictated from birth to death

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,120
and there was no way you could change

00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,919
anything and it kind of like made a

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,919
whole lot of debates about freedom and

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,660
and rights completely meaningless if you

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,220
can't actually change anything in your

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,870
life the entire time so there wasn't a

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,540
whole lot of interesting conversation

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,280
about freedom going on there except the

00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,280
question of whether freedom even existed

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,340
Thomas Aquinas he believed that there is

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:41,460
sort of a universal truth universal law

00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,410
good bad right wrong

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,130
and that we discover it through reason

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,810
through the faculties or mind but he

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,720
believed that what we're discovering is

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,700
something that is dictated by by divine

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,470
law so it's sort of the opposite of

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,720
Socrates he decided that there was a

00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:02,310
divine truth and we could only discover

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:06,750
it through reason SCOTUS he believed

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,400
that humans have a natural tendency to

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,280
pursue happiness which is sort of an

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,350
individual freedom but also a natural

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,980
tendency to pursue justice which is kind

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:19,170
of like a society freedom and that the

00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,810
freedom of individuals was in fact the

00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,180
power to way between the two decide when

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,070
your individual happiness is worth

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:31,920
sacrificing for the justice of society

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:34,520
and vice versa Descartes kind of

00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,620
elevated reason to the absolute height

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,800
the pinnacle of everything so reason was

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,610
the ultimate source of good and bad and

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,680
truth and the way you determine what's

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:52,470
right and what rights humans should have

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:54,900
is through a process of reason Princess

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,870
Elizabeth who was by the way born right

00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,900
here in Heidelberg she is famous for a

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,110
series of dialogues with Descartes that

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:07,520
led to one of his most famous works

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:10,350
passions of the soul and she argued that

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,070
the thing is we have reason and it may

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:15,900
lead us to land on good things but

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,340
there's no guarantee that your reason is

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,910
going to lead you to making good choices

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,380
or taking good actions and even if you

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,450
have good intentions you may

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,100
accidentally end up doing things that

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,810
cause harm through the best of

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:32,820
intentions and you still have to

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,280
evaluate by the results she having been

00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,050
born of royalty she argued that

00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,000
centralized rule has a serious problem

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,360
that it really does lack the information

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,190
to make proper decisions around what

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:51,240
individuals need around what society

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:52,740
needs John Locke so his idea is that

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,030
freedom is sort of a fundamental

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,300
property of human beings

00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:00,300
fundamental nature of human beings and

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,430
that by your fundamental nature you have

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,980
a right to own property a property was

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,540
very important in these contexts because

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,420
there was a there was an opposing idea

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,040
of serfdom where the royalty or the

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,480
ruling class would own all the property

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,670
and all you could ever do is limb live

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,200
on it and like grow food for the royalty

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,110
and that was it so then there was the

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,520
concept of freedom is property is the

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,320
kind of freedom that you have the

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,470
ability to own your own things to own

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,760
your own land to create your own food

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:32,820
he believed that society is about

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,430
creating security for individuals and

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,400
that in order to create the society that

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:43,650
adds security you end up giving up some

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:45,510
Liberty sound familiar so he believed

00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,860
that that that property rights is

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,080
actually one of the most important

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,820
freedoms and that the government is able

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,620
to enforce property rights better than

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,330
the individual because the individual

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,920
can only like argue against other

00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,200
individuals whereas the government can

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,300
sort of dictate from the top down

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,070
so he was in favor of strengthening

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:08,160
governments in order to protect property

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:12,030
rights and security du Chatelet she had

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,100
a number of dialogues with Locke on the

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:18,000
laws of identity of contradiction she

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,890
believed so so identity is a thing a

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,980
thing is what it is and contradiction is

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,660
if a thing is it can't also not be so

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,040
Locke was saying there is no such truth

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,810
to either of them and she's saying no no

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,670
there's a fundamental reality here if

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,400
something is it is and if it is it can't

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,130
not be which kind of goes into her whole

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,070
idea of universal principles there's

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,920
like a fundamental truth underlying all

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,200
human knowledge and actions now she's

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,090
primarily famous as a mathematician and

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,450
physicist for her commentary on the

00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:51,900
works of Isaac Newton and work on that

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:56,430
was actually so pre-staged some of the

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:57,930
work of Einstein on kinetic energy I was

00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,670
300 years too early so it's like very

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,940
rough but there's actually some of the

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,140
formulas end up in Einsteins work so you

00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,790
can kind of understand being a

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,020
mathematician and physicist why she was

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,910
so concerned with no no there's a

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,060
reality and it

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,320
is what it is like this is a common

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:17,900
common thing among mathematicians and

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:20,270
physicists Hume he believed that humans

00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,460
have a natural benevolence but it's only

00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,950
two people in close association so like

00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,140
your close family and friends and so the

00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,920
Justice of society is something that we

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,540
create by convention he thought that

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,490
property art rights were some of the

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:38,570
most important rights that we can create

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:41,260
by convention and one of the things he's

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,670
famous for is Humes law which is to say

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,380
describing the way that society works

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,600
today doesn't really tell you how it

00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,460
ought to be and it's actually very hard

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,010
to reason from what you see around you

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:59,090
today to what should be you shouldn't

00:11:52,010 --> 00:12:04,130
try to make that connection jean-jacques

00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:07,310
Rousseau so he believed and this is kind

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,110
of the opposite of back-and-forth here

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,210
there's a lot of dialogue people having

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,580
different ideas of the same fundamental

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:16,190
principles so he believed the natural

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,270
state of humanity is to simply follow

00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,010
your dog desires

00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,830
sort of like animals wandering in the

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:25,160
field you own nothing you need nothing

00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:29,270
just sort of hunter-gatherer sort of

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,670
kind of natural freedom but he believed

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,440
in a very industrial revolution kind of

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,680
way that the purpose of forming

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,660
societies is for progress that is the

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,910
fundamental reason that we joined

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,710
together and things like property and

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,030
protection that come out of that they're

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,370
just they're just really side effects

00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:54,500
the main purpose of coming together is

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:56,780
for progress Immanuel Kant he kind of

00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,910
elevate he also elevated reason as sort

00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,140
of the fundamental definition of of what

00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,970
is right and wrong you'll see that

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,580
coming up more and more as time goes on

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,320
sort of the idea of divinity as the

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,080
fundamental definition was replaced with

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,300
the idea of human reason as being a way

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,920
of reaching what is the definition of

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:17,540
right and wrong and what human rights we

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,790
should have his focus was on intentions

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,110
and actions so what's important is that

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,029
you want to do

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,649
what's right and you do what you think

00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:26,000
is right but if it has terrible

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:30,380
consequences that doesn't really matter

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,839
at least you tried your best and he kind

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,760
of unified to ideas that were floating

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,620
around before the question of whether

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,140
reason or experience should be the

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,980
primary definition of reality by saying

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:45,050
that so our experience is actually a

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,380
combination of what we perceive what our

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:50,660
senses can can absorb and how we reason

00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,000
about what our senses absorb so it's

00:13:50,660 --> 00:14:01,040
actually both together defines what we

00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:04,820
experience Thomas Paine uhm he believed

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:09,470
that no one should own property by

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:11,690
default but that property came about for

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,420
agriculture so it's kind of like that

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:18,860
progress idea but a very specific sort

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,660
of progress which is necessary so

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,790
agriculture was necessary people needed

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,560
to like mark off a lot of land if they

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,209
were going to go going to grow food in

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,540
it but it's not actually a good thing

00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:31,339
that they own that and in recompense for

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,860
taking that land away from other people

00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,690
they should pay taxes and those taxes

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,880
should be used to the benefit of all the

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,699
people who don't have land so they're

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,800
kind of like paying for the the

00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:48,680
obligation they've created through

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:51,529
taking property away from others Bentham

00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,390
is another opposite again he believed

00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:57,829
that there is no such thing as natural

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:59,779
law or rights and again it's reason that

00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:01,550
defines what is right or wrong

00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:04,519
but the way you evaluate what or is

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,470
right or wrong is by social utility so

00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,390
he believed that because there's no

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,430
natural rights whatsoever the only

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,170
rights you have are the ones that are

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:16,250
granted by the state so that includes

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:18,470
property and that violating those rights

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,740
is perfectly justified for the good of

00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,019
society because the state only gave you

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,860
those rights they can take them away if

00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:26,860
it's for the good of everyone

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:34,339
Hegel believed in a concept of

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,649
developing yourself to the greatest good

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:38,839
but that that that development could be

00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,610
limited by the social institutions you

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,610
live in and so you should create very

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:47,449
very strong governments in order to

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:50,449
protect your ability to become the

00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:53,180
greatest self so the rights granted

00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:56,180
allow you to exercise your individual

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,249
choice and he saw a life freedom from

00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,749
full slavery and property as like the

00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:03,019
most important rights that you could be

00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:04,970
granted he's credited as being one of

00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:08,240
the significant influences behind the

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,769
Nazi movement but he would have been

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,930
completely horrified to see that what

00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:14,199
his idea of the strong government ended

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:21,079
up creating as opposed to creating

00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:23,480
self-actualization Thomas Hill Greene so

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:25,550
you kind of start to see a shift like

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,199
from we need strong governments to

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,459
protect people it's like no no the

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,649
government should stay out of the way

00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,959
and they should only intervene in order

00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:34,579
to protect Liberty so it's like you can

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,680
really get too much intervention if you

00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:38,600
go away over the top on the on the

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,370
strong government side and that the

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,519
whole purpose of group forming together

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,319
into social units is to promote the

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,999
development of individuals promote your

00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:48,999
your own greater good

00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:56,720
my least favorite philosopher so

00:16:54,439 --> 00:17:00,139
Nietzsche believed there is no such

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,420
thing as truth there is only an infinite

00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:04,429
number of perspectives there is no such

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,589
thing as right or wrong it does not

00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,390
exist all there is is a bunch of

00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,309
cultural definitions and you know the

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,199
culture you were raised in will tell you

00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:14,750
what's right or wrong but in fact your

00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,740
culture is probably like has no grounds

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,789
for telling you that and you should

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,169
ignore it and that the strongest people

00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:22,880
will define their own values they'll

00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:24,709
throw off the shackles of culture and

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,649
define their own values and impose their

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:29,690
will on the weak and he believed that

00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:32,899
the fundamental truth of human existence

00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:35,720
is the will to power the desire to

00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:39,740
impose your will on everything and

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,940
everyone around you creepy dude even all

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,940
the photos of him are creepy

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:52,130
Hemme little uh refreshing break so

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:54,590
gandhi he lived in a system that was it

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,039
was very unjust towards a certain set of

00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:00,470
people the set of people he was part of

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,030
and while there was at the time an idea

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,830
that the way you deal with a system you

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:07,850
don't like is through violent revolution

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:11,570
he believed that instead you should take

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:14,690
a path of non-violence and express what

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,000
needs to change in a very constant very

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,940
visible but very peaceful way and he was

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,150
very successful at it he also believed

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,919
in like accepting a wide array of

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,679
beliefs especially a wide array of valid

00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,360
religions for him but that he believed

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,159
if you dug deeply enough he would find

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,020
there's an ethical core across all of

00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,750
them so there's a fundamental truth that

00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,850
you find sort of woven between all the

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:43,039
the value systems of the world that was

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:43,760
his perspective keynes he's kind of

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,580
coming at it from an economic

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,830
perspective he believed that the free

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,179
market doesn't always work it can

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,480
actually cause problems when it goes

00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:55,039
awry as a sort of partly out of the

00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,520
depression the Great Depression of the

00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,159
20s sort of a reaction to that he

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,570
believed that self interests may not

00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,880
always be enlightened it may be

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,620
completely selfish and self-interest may

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,510
not serve the public interest so

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:11,809
sometimes you have to impose structures

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:14,090
so that the self-interest doesn't Drive

00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:16,789
in ways that are destructive

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:19,070
he believed that state intervention was

00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:21,140
a good thing to mitigate recessions and

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,450
depressions and he also believed that

00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,220
social units forming together can

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,900
accomplish more than individuals and

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:31,070
that was kind of why you should form

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:35,360
them and give them power Hayek was a

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:37,820
great opponent of Keynes because he felt

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,679
that Keynes had sort of encouraged a

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,169
growth of big government and the

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,690
destruction of free-market capitalism so

00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:46,940
his argument was that social order is

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:50,120
just so incredibly complex like human

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,039
societies are so incredibly complex that

00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,809
you just can't completely understand

00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,040
them to the point of really being able

00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:57,380
to effectively

00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,080
direct them from the top down it just

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,880
doesn't work which actually is an idea

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:09,380
that kind of you can think hark backs to

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:12,530
the shuffle a as well Philip a foot she

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,230
believed in right sort of defining

00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,780
what's right by what's beneficial to the

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:20,720
individual and society evaluating it

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,640
both ways and that there was a certain

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,280
compulsion to read like there was a

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,050
certain reason towards it like you could

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,550
reason your way to deciding what was

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,410
right but there's also a voluntary

00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,480
aspect so it's not like you're a slave

00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,190
to reason you have in fact a choice and

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,820
there's there's value in the fact that

00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:40,370
you make that choice she was very

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,370
opposed to Nietzsche she wrote actively

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:46,300
against him believed that kind of

00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:49,070
parking back to Aristotle a bit that

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,930
justice and benevolence are sort of the

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:56,090
fundamental Constitution of a human

00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:58,310
animal like you had to evaluate humans

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,860
by their fundamental Constitution sort

00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:02,630
of like you can't evaluate a cheetah

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,310
running fast the same way you would

00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,690
evaluate a tortoise running fast they're

00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,910
different animals they have different

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,470
fundamental constitutions and so you

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,270
evaluate them differently but for

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,000
evaluating humans justice and

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,430
benevolence is one of the most important

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,170
aspects of their basic behavior and I

00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:21,050
couldn't find a photo for her under a

00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,910
public domain or Creative Commons

00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,400
license so this is a photo of one of the

00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,890
very earliest philosophers who is

00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:32,180
according to Plato was Socrates teacher

00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,320
in rhetoric her name was Aspasia it just

00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,670
looked a little weird having no photo

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,670
there after everybody else had one

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:43,700
Martin Luther King jr. so he was like

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,590
Gandhi operating in a system that was

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,660
unjust although in his case it was a

00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,030
system that was founded on the

00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:54,470
principles of freedom they just weren't

00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:57,170
applied equally his his philosophy of

00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,570
non-violent civil disobedience was very

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,310
much inspired by Gandhi he even took it

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:05,540
a little further and he believed in

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:08,909
using established legal channels in

00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:11,220
order to bring about social

00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:18,840
change and he was very successful at

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:21,359
that Martha Nussbaum believed or defined

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,879
a set of sort of universal abstract

00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,710
norms so one of the hard things about

00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:27,590
defining what's right in a universal

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,940
sense is we have many cultures and

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,039
cultures have different ways of

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,809
expressing things so she sort of took a

00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,849
step back from saying well that cultures

00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:37,349
bad in all ways it's good in all ways

00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:39,869
and said let's define it more abstractly

00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:42,389
maybe a bit like Gandhi in a sense that

00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:43,649
we have these things and then they will

00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:45,840
be expressed differently in different

00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:48,840
cultures so she called these the

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,539
functional freedoms so they're valuable

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,399
both in themselves they're valuable to

00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:58,049
human beings and also as a means to an

00:22:53,399 --> 00:23:00,119
end so one of these is one of these

00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:01,919
values is or one of these functional

00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,899
freedoms is personal control over your

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,399
environment so that includes both the

00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:08,399
right to participate in the political

00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:11,039
process the right to own property the

00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:14,029
right to modify your environment around

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:18,840
you to reason about it and to improve it

00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:20,429
and it's in her work that I see the

00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,570
greatest influence on free software

00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:27,359
which is not necessarily surprising so I

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:29,249
I don't believe that Stallman ever met

00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,679
her or attended one of her classes or

00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:34,950
read her books but she was getting her

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:38,999
PhD in philosophy and at Harvard he has

00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:40,320
met her I wonder when yeah so she was

00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:42,869
getting her PhD in philosophy at Harvard

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,519
in the early 70s and she was teaching

00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:47,279
philosophy in Harvard through the 70s

00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:49,710
and 80s which is exactly when Richard

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,710
was sort of defining the principles of

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,479
software freedom and whether whether he

00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,369
had already met her yet or not that in

00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:58,109
those academic circles those ideas were

00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:01,320
coming they're becoming quite vocally

00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:02,729
circulated so there was I'm looking at

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,259
the details of her work I'm quite

00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:06,269
confident there was influence even if I

00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:08,749
don't know exactly when they met or what

00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:08,749
they talked about

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:15,700
and here we come to what I consider to

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,820
be one of the greatest philosophers of

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,590
our time richard stallman so some of the

00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:25,560
things he's famous for are the for

00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:28,840
software freedoms copyleft licensing and

00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,250
the rights of users or defining the

00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,890
rights of users in defending the rights

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:36,250
of users so this is where I'm going to

00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:38,770
spend a little bit more time so

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,630
originally in 1940's when software was

00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:43,030
first created it was seen as a

00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,560
utilitarian good it was not protected as

00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,810
property Hardware was protected as

00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,550
property but software was not it was

00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,990
considered like a bridge you can't

00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:55,420
really own it it's just sort of an

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:57,730
expression of it in the 1960s in the

00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,740
u.s. copyright registration started to

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,540
be granted but they were granted under

00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,510
something called the rule of doubt which

00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,370
is where the the Copyright Office would

00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,890
basically say we really don't think this

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:11,710
is copyrightable but will will issue you

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:13,770
a registration just in case it's proven

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:18,340
to be copyrightable later just in case

00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:20,410
in 74 there was this Commission form to

00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:24,040
investigate the question of whether

00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:26,110
software should be copyrightable it took

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,180
them until 1979 to bring back an answer

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,530
so when Bill Gates sent out his letter

00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,410
to hobbyists saying you're stealing

00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:37,150
software by sharing it he was wrong they

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:39,340
were not it was perfectly legal in 1979

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,320
they issued a statement that they

00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,730
believed that that software should be

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:49,090
copyrightable but it wasn't actually

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:50,920
added to copyright law until 1980 so

00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,390
there's an interesting factor of timing

00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,400
that I didn't really realize until I

00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,050
started studying this and that is that

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,420
Richard Stallman's first statements

00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:02,710
around communal software the the nature

00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:04,150
of free software was 1981 so in another

00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,670
talk that I gave this year kind of

00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:08,500
explained it as free software is an

00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:10,330
equal and opposite reaction to

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,740
proprietary software you know a lot of

00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,780
people kind of think of it they think oh

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,460
yeah proprietary software has been

00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,570
around forever and free software's this

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,800
strange new idea

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:22,450
no same time same place and same reason

00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,170
they were both sort of created in

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,450
environments

00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:27,070
of Oh suddenly people are thinking about

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,690
the possibility that software might be

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,630
something you can own and what does that

00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,610
mean

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,590
so in 1983 he published the canoe

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:39,160
manifesto and started the good new

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:41,290
project in 1985 the free software

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:45,820
foundation was launched and also the

00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:49,840
canoe Emacs license 1987 moves the GCC

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:52,720
GPL this is the the GNU Emacs license

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,840
the GCC GPL were kind of the precursors

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,480
to the GPL 1.0 or version 1 which was

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:03,790
1989 but that you see that the ideas

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,350
shaping in his head over that decade so

00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:07,330
you're probably all familiar with the

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,350
for software freedoms but I will repeat

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,810
them anyway because they're worth

00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:13,660
repeating they're the freedom to use

00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:15,790
study and modify redistribute and

00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:19,720
redistribute modified versions of

00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:21,610
software now the reason I kind of read

00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,960
like reflect these back to Nussbaum is

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,030
if you think about her functional

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,160
freedoms the idea is so it has to be

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,750
valuable in itself and here you have

00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,370
these freedoms are valuable in

00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,750
themselves it's valuable to use and

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,930
study and modify and redistribute

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:37,150
software but there's a greater purpose

00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:40,330
it's also a means to an to an end it's

00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:42,490
also a means to user freedom to

00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,920
increasing the freedom of the people who

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:47,980
are doing these activities so it's it's

00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:51,330
both pieces it's it's it's the inherent

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,330
value and the means to an end

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,730
so copyleft

00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,010
is you think back to Martin Luther King

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,630
it's a bit of using the established

00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:05,110
legal system to bring about social

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:07,450
change so it starts with the idea that

00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,100
software is property now people will

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,630
debate even within the free software

00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,090
community whether software should be

00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,780
property or should not be property but

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:19,600
right now under copyright law it is and

00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:22,540
copyleft builds on that principle to say

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,340
ok it's if it's property then we still

00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,890
want to make sure we ensure this sharing

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:29,260
as well so a developer owns their

00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:31,900
software that they create the product of

00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:35,680
their labor and that developer grants

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:37,059
the four freedoms and at the same time

00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,009
requires that

00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:41,919
anyone who benefits from those four

00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:44,289
freedoms is also required to grant the

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,200
same freedoms so it's like it's in a

00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:50,350
sense it's twisting the original idea of

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:56,759
copyright to hold things the lock things

00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:59,470
down in order to require them to be free

00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:02,789
so if there's any question about whether

00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:04,840
Stallman thinks of this as philosophy

00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:06,639
these are a couple of quotes but there's

00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,399
certainly plenty more and in the first

00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:11,139
one he was responding to someone who is

00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:12,549
like narrowing him down on what the

00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:13,960
legal interpretation of something would

00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:16,869
be and he's like no no no we're not

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,659
talking about what the current law would

00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:21,639
say we're talking about ethics so this

00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:23,259
is this is a completely different

00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:28,269
question we're talking about ethics

00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:30,730
which is philosophy and a second quote

00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:32,830
where he's comparing he's again saying

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,899
I'm thinking about what the law should

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:38,139
be so this is philosophy the philosophy

00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:39,820
is sort of the principles and then law

00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:42,309
is the expression of that in our

00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,049
practical society sometimes it's an

00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:45,369
inaccurate representation of our

00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:47,379
philosophy sometimes it's a more

00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:51,279
accurate representation he also

00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:53,169
explicitly compares like proprietary

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,080
software with the Jim Crow laws which

00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:58,450
are the racial segregation laws of the

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,149
1960s that Martin Luther King was so

00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,039
actively fighting against so he very

00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:04,840
definitely see whether he talks about it

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,279
most of the time or not there is very

00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:11,320
definitely an aspect to his thinking

00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:14,499
that sees this as philosophy so to tie

00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,539
it back together a bit within free

00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:19,269
software we have a sense of a right and

00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:21,730
a wrong there is a fundamental right and

00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:24,820
wrong freedom versus proprietary and

00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,830
there are people like Nietzsche who will

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,929
take everything they can get and give

00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:31,090
nothing in return this is the social

00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:34,029
injustice or the the will to power but

00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:37,149
they are wrong they are not the way that

00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:40,080
society should operate there's also a

00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:43,179
sense of of using the laws that we have

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,360
copyright in order to create social

00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:49,830
change working within the system now to

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:53,880
change it to more accurately reflect the

00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:55,470
fundamental philosophy that we see the

00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,720
thing that I really want people to carry

00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:00,750
away from this is the sense that free

00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,700
software is not a frenzy idea it's not

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,649
like a little segment of people on the

00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,929
side sort of working on software this is

00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:10,230
actually one of the fundamental

00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:11,940
philosophical debates of our time and it

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,010
all has to do with this new thing

00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,320
software that never existed before and

00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:19,380
how that should be integrated into our

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:25,500
whole system of society and humanity and

00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:38,970
Bright's that's it any questions do you

00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:41,240
have time for questions Allison for a

00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,240
talk

00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:52,410
so please queue up at the microphones so

00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,450
I know you were you're trying to give

00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,120
this whirlwind tour so you you missed a

00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,950
few things that I actually and you

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,270
probably know them you just decided cut

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,950
them and I'm actually basically asking

00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:05,060
why you cut them because I know you're

00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:07,350
aware of them the two philosopher

00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:10,050
philosophical schools that I've recently

00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:13,890
modeled free-software around and this is

00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:17,070
influenced by my experience in recent

00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,690
times in free software our Hegelian

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:22,530
models of triads which you didn't

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:24,360
mention because I feel like we have this

00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,400
free software versus proprietary

00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,000
software our modeling of it is basically

00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,530
in this high DeLeon sort of way I don't

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,840
know if we're modeling it correctly I

00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,130
think there might be flaws in saying you

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,510
mentioned a few times free software

00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,220
diametrically opposed to proprietary

00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:41,400
software that's kind of the Hegelian

00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,540
thesis and antithesis and I worried that

00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,360
we're modeling it that way

00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:47,520
mistakingly which leads me to Koko who

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,500
you didn't mention whom I generally

00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,380
dislike but there's a certain post

00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,150
structuralist argument to the manner to

00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,560
which we've interacted with power and

00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:57,750
the way we've created these different

00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,250
power structures both in the proprietary

00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,050
software side we're just using copyright

00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,670
power to just totally restrict people

00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,500
and then obviously we have to admit to

00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:06,540
ourselves with copyleft we're using that

00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,250
same power we always say is it's this

00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,960
judo move to fight against but we're

00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,550
also creating power structures that have

00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,020
created complexities and then when I

00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:15,510
think about things like proprietary

00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,280
relicensing and and having using

00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,890
copyleft the way I see a pharaoh GPL

00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,050
being used it disturbs me as the author

00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:23,700
of the license but another hand I think

00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:25,050
of pecan I'm like well that's I've just

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,450
created a power system that's now being

00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,610
used against me and I created it right

00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,920
and so I wonder if you think about those

00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,960
two ideas like the Hegelian triads and

00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,060
and Foucault and post-structuralism and

00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,520
how it interacts with our current issues

00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,930
of the day in free software it comes

00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,400
back to my warning at the beginning that

00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:43,200
I can't cover two and a half thousand

00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,000
years of history in 20 minutes and do a

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,580
very comprehensive job of it but those

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,680
are two very interesting ideas and that

00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,540
actually so what I said last night that

00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,250
now I want to do another talk which is

00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,840
instead of doing the history and then

00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,520
kind of tying it into free software at

00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,560
the end I want to take free software and

00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,029
I do the philosophy of free software in

00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,590
much more detail those are

00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:04,379
things I would put in and also news

00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,820
bombs sort of functional freedoms is

00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:07,440
another thing that I would expand much

00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:11,419
more thoroughly in another talk or blog

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,369
poster but but yes that's true thank you

00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:17,220
hey listen thank you very much my

00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:18,839
question is a bit left-field I think and

00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,359
if you can't choose not to answer it

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:24,480
feel free to I'm a biologist and I'm

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:28,139
very interested in the current research

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,139
I guess of biotechnology and I've seen a

00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:34,500
quite a few quotes quoting that biotech

00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:38,129
right now is the software movement of a

00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:41,609
decade ago and it to me as well adjust

00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:44,279
the propriety is the one thing but the

00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:45,599
life aspects of biology is the other

00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:48,539
thing if people start tampering with it

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,099
and I'm my question is do you think you

00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:51,629
can use the same philosophical question

00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,929
that you're raising here about the free

00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:57,569
software towards the biology angle I

00:34:54,929 --> 00:35:00,119
think you can from the proprietary angle

00:34:57,569 --> 00:35:03,539
so many of the arguments that we make

00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,770
here do apply there I think in terms of

00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:06,180
the fact that you're mucking about with

00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,980
life

00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,930
aside from free software being used it

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,960
isn't like medical contexts where it

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:15,150
could it could like malfunctioning could

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,250
cause like the loss of life I think

00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,690
there are there are ethical concerns in

00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,190
biotech that we don't that we

00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:22,049
fortunately don't have to deal with in

00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,089
software in some ways it makes our

00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:26,760
questions easier so you get the next

00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:30,109
round so my follow-up to that is a

00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:32,460
comment that I see they the biotech

00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:35,190
community is taking a lot of their cue

00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,740
from the software movement and I was

00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:40,619
wondering if we could consider that

00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,990
responsibility carefully because if we

00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:46,260
omit that responsibility they might do

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:49,410
so as well but I'm not sure if you we

00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,240
feel that that is our job so I think

00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,680
software developers alone probably don't

00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,240
know enough to do it but I'd love to

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,650
start a conference in Cape Town with you

00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:05,000
about that it's a dialogue we need we

00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:07,619
need both involved yeah well comments

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,829
what if not then let's thank the speaker

00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,829
again

00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,010
