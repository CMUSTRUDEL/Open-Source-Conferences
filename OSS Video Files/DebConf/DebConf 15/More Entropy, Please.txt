https://debconf15.debconf.org/

In this talk, I will discuss Monty Hall problem by its computer simulation and will show how Random Bit Generator is important, and more entropy is needed.

In Debconf 14, I listend the talk by Tom Marble, which was titled "Security not by chance: the AltusMetrum hardware true random number generator".

It was very impressive for me.  (I had a TRNG implementation of mine, but I didn't recognize its importance.)

Since then, I have been considering some promotion for more entropy, and l wrote the article (see the first URL).

The story doesn't directly discuss TRNG itself, but it explains that bias should be killed and it discuss an effective side channel attack, and it emphasizes more entropy is required.

hello everyone thank you for coming

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:12,390
I'm introducing niba with his talk about

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:16,020
more entropy disease hi

00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:20,160
[Applause]

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:27,000
today's topic is more entropy freeze the

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:32,099
title says all and and during this

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,800
conference our family doing a promotion

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:44,070
of more entropy freeze so so please call

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:49,230
us about the game and I will explain in

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:55,140
this talk I I explained the promotion of

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:58,820
more entropy freeze the game and and I I

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:03,390
will explain a proof its philosophy and

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:09,450
product and before explanation of the

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:13,650
game is because I don't have enough time

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:17,580
I I explained a bit off of its law

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:22,250
Sophie that these days people cares

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:28,770
about an encryption after the Snowden

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:32,759
incident two years ago but we choose to

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,909
for better encryption we need good

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,390
Londoners that's the point

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:43,350
so yes the I think that people deserve

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:46,110
to control their own computing and I

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,100
think that most of the people in this

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:53,070
room understand this philosophy and but

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,590
unfortunately backdoors on the software

00:01:53,070 --> 00:02:01,049
vulnerabilities were so common these

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:03,409
days and the surveillance massive

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:09,090
surveillance is very difficult to avoid

00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:13,910
from the viewpoint of the just a user so

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:18,050
our our fighter is

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:23,900
using encryption and we have a dog

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:28,250
project let's encrypt or FSF has a page

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:32,660
email self defense and we encourage and

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:37,970
we we we have we work very hard for

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:41,660
their project like guna PG to hotel but

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:47,270
the important point is that for

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:52,630
encryption key key is important little

00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:57,130
early and the key includes static key of

00:02:52,630 --> 00:03:03,320
the pair of a public key and private key

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:08,870
session key or nouns etc and those keys

00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:13,270
should be London London here means no

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:20,330
one can control or guess its generation

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:22,940
yes that and in to summarize people

00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:27,170
deserve to control their own computing

00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:31,820
and because we use more encryption these

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:37,010
days more randomness makes sense

00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:41,000
so and in the central of computing

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:43,850
freedom we have a single point we need

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,300
London number generation which no one

00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:54,170
can control and the here is a promotion

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:58,250
for no one's control of the random

00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:02,720
number generation we have a product yes

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:06,970
and for do-it-yourself hackers for

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:11,350
electronics these days I recommend this

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:15,350
board educational evaluation board or

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:21,350
FluMist st-michel I think that it's

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:24,410
something like 10 euros and by 10 you

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:27,410
know you get to London by generators I'm

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:33,040
sorry because we have a Dumbo

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:39,400
under another target board yes and and

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:42,980
if it's so big for you my business

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:48,070
selling the smaller smaller one if we

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:51,460
want and this is this comes with a

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:56,170
transparent tube because the

00:04:51,460 --> 00:05:02,230
transparency is very important for us so

00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:02,230
[Applause]

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:12,650
here comes the first part the our game

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:21,560
to promote the concept more entropy

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:25,700
please the I wrote a story in my my wish

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:29,120
and I insist that the more enthalpy is

00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:32,720
required in this context entropy means a

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:37,130
Londoners and the game

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:42,820
I am country introducing the interesting

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,820
math game called Monty Hall problem and

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:54,110
it is described like this but I quoted

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:58,340
quoted from the Mullins website but I

00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,020
think that my own explanation would be

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:06,070
better

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:11,360
the in this game we have a full five

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:16,820
five people host today it's me Yutaka

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:20,890
and there are three doors my family

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,890
please yes

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:30,599
each each person the placenta door a

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:36,659
single door story

00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:41,990
this is a door and then she lost she is

00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:51,180
my son and are you me is my daughter yes

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:54,690
yes she's somehow so sure and now we

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:58,740
have a player Yuki hallelujah Buki also

00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:02,849
from Japan and we have three doors and a

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:09,780
player and a Yama host and the game goes

00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:13,409
like this host host select I have to

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:20,939
explain the door behind the door we have

00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:23,639
a car or sheep or goat I think that we

00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:31,979
Japanese don't have a good distinction

00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:37,889
between ship and gold yes and I select

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:45,680
the car and and the London s is very

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:51,270
important here to shuffle and behind

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:54,599
behind the door we have a car and the

00:07:51,270 --> 00:08:01,919
purpose of the player is to get to win a

00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:08,909
car and the second is that I ask player

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:13,259
the initial choice of him so which door

00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:19,889
do you sell do you choose yeah boots on

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:25,979
that's an initial choice he's he lost my

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:29,729
son and then I host I open another door

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:35,089
other than other than he lost and Richie

00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:41,629
is has a gold please open

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:45,589
stewey yes then the number five I asked

00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:53,410
Priya the final choice sticker a switch

00:08:45,589 --> 00:09:10,420
I'm I mean that keep his first choice or

00:08:53,410 --> 00:09:12,379
switch his and I asked a second choice I

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,339
I asked

00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:21,680
Yabuki Sam for the final choice which

00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:26,870
you change you or not your decision you

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:30,980
stick your first choice then I host open

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:32,439
the door of the final choice please open

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:39,399
the door

00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:47,029
he was she Oh God McCarron okay they

00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:51,620
lose yes that's the game and and there

00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:54,559
are possible strategy of player the the

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,980
initial choice is London then always

00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:02,809
stick the initial choice or always

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:08,120
changed the first choice well there are

00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:17,290
many we could consider many variant of

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:22,279
the strategy but and the how London s is

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:28,720
important in this game is that the host

00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:33,319
me should be fear and I should avoid

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:36,529
some attacks against side channel attack

00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:43,549
side channel attacker is very easy to

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:46,930
explain Yabuki can sneak sneaky that

00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:50,990
this is a side channel attack

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:55,279
that I should prevent those kind of side

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:59,660
channel attack and under another

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:02,990
important point is that it should be

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:12,500
constant time my computation time to

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:17,720
decide with out which door open how to

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:21,470
say my computation time to decide the

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:27,110
opening door should be constant time to

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:31,600
because the clever player could observe

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:39,910
my behavior to answer the final choice

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:44,740
yes this is a just a metaphor in many

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:49,900
software implementations like do not eg

00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:54,279
with the developer of those software

00:11:49,900 --> 00:12:03,910
should care those things constant time

00:11:54,279 --> 00:12:08,450
computation and Londoners yes and and

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:12,709
the point of this lesson is that to be

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:17,540
fair for fair host this means that the

00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:21,320
good software for encryption London s is

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:25,520
so important under even if it's not used

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:29,770
directly or it appears it will not

00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:35,350
needed we actually need more Londoners

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:42,320
so my point is that more entropy please

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:46,520
yes and so in this promotion in this

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:52,730
week our family are playing this game

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:58,670
and if you win the winner get Japanese

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:59,779
candy so please join this game please

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,259
call us too

00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:08,110
during this game during this conference

00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:11,959
that's our presentation and we have a

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:19,699
seven minutes or so question-and-answer

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:23,089
time so thank you

00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:28,040
Yabuki son and my family and let me

00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:33,620
again explained he is a Japanese Debian

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:43,519
developer Yuki Holly avati under my

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:50,449
family my wife story and the my son he

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:56,019
is so shy he lost and Ayumi my lovely

00:13:50,449 --> 00:14:07,189
daughter thank you very much

00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:09,680
so do you have any question yes the USB

00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:14,209
device that you showed earlier

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:19,399
yes is the firmware on that open yes sir

00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:24,670
the yes it's very good question it's not

00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:29,209
only the firmware which is free the the

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:36,199
for this product the PCB design is as a

00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:38,809
free design and I did my best to it

00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:42,550
should be my opinion is that those kinds

00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:47,569
of the hardware should be lipid

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:48,800
reproducible by anyone and it should be

00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:57,170
transparent

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:58,610
tigrerra like that so I I was very

00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,670
worried about this problem a few days

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,800
ago because I generated new keys yes to

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,079
bring to this conference I didn't have a

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,529
device so I went looking online for

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,660
better ways to feed ever andum and I

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:12,390
found that there is not a centralized

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,570
location

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:18,570
to explain yeah what types of demons you

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:21,660
can use I'm what their drawbacks and

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,340
advantages are I have those of you that

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,930
want more entropy which I would like to

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,390
have more entropy have you thought about

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,730
trying to consolidate I ended up using

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:32,070
random sound which is a demon that's in

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,890
Debian that will read off the microphone

00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:37,020
to add to dev random and on a webpage I

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,360
found the video one that will take

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,070
pictures Union and do that so I added

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,080
those to my wrench people to make it

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,630
better but I would love to have had a

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,480
tutorial on all of our current ways I

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:53,940
can yeah yes so is anyone working on

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:57,840
that I don't think so unfortunately but

00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:00,840
your question is very good one and in

00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:08,970
general it would be easier to use

00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:10,890
average demon each the IDI and that the

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,460
entropy is also is the computation

00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:18,630
itself

00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:22,490
the CPU it uses Londoners of the gnome

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:27,090
no control the ability of the CPU itself

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:33,270
to get enthalpy and it is easy to just

00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:36,750
up to get a PhD yes that's a easier one

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:39,600
but if you if you control your own

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:42,870
computer it's not a really yes or

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:48,500
something like that in that in that case

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:53,070
I I would recommend that one but under

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:57,890
those kinds of the hardware is spiria

00:16:53,070 --> 00:17:04,020
because the have HD depends on the the

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:09,150
CPU manufacturer and if we use this kit

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:12,230
we it is a kind of abuse you know this

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:15,680
is an educational evaluation kit the

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:22,560
semiconductor manufacturer the vendor

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:26,160
don't expect such usage yes so it would

00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:30,480
be no backdoor by the

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:35,850
dr. fender but it is highly likely that

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:40,470
the famous CPU by Intel or something

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:44,520
like that it would be a target to to

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:48,390
have yes by the someone yes so you

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,430
should have those kinds of the many

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,670
random sources yes

00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:57,780
that's my recommendation but I don't

00:17:53,670 --> 00:18:01,080
know that any good difference tutorial

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:05,670
about that it should be available and I

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:09,200
would like to do some improvement in

00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:11,250
this area thank you for your question I

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,780
just wanted to say that one of the

00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,890
really big risks of asking a question

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,420
like that at a big conference is that

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,250
you have a large number of witnesses to

00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,200
you volunteering to write that

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,130
documentation so thank you for doing

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,180
that

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:28,880
[Applause]

00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:32,150
so the last word is happy hugging and

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:39,230
let's pray more enthalpy please game yes

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:43,420
thank you very much honestly seriously

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,420
