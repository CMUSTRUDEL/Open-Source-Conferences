00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:21,600
so this is the second trademark forensic

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:27,090
both today basically about what the

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:30,269
trademark achieve it does what it and

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,059
what it should do and just work the for

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,910
the outgoing strategy for Debian as an

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,250
entity should be with regards to

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:50,190
grounding trademark requests and also

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:52,820
potentially so same as last round does

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,820
anyone want to start

00:00:52,910 --> 00:01:12,150
or should say well we all agree that

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,010
there is official Debian and you can all

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,960
agree that official dentists I take

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,140
official images I install it on a

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,159
machine are you not an ADA that points I

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,799
don't know the name the contract

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,549
mumphrey whatever and when I install

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,400
this this is a system which has been

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,979
which is officially tell you anything

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,710
else if I enable contract if I have

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,439
backwards if I whatever it's not

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,310
official data anymore we'd also all

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,310
agree that there is

00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,670
which are on the far side in which I

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,280
derived from Daniel but which are not I

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:52,210
mean anymore in between there's this

00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,250
field which we were talking about it

00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:59,530
seems that the rough consensus is

00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:02,380
leaning in the direction of they'll be

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:06,250
named in some form or other are you

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:09,369
supported by a test suit of some kind

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:12,910
which can be run on a machine to see if

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:16,390
it behaves as a medallion shoot together

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:20,620
with a set of what you need to do to

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,480
actually for example if you wanted sauce

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:35,500
fiber even if you go through all the

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:38,350
tests we also which basically because

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,120
this test student everything the

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,830
assumption is people want to be as close

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,900
to official Daniel as possible to think

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:50,680
it kind of do really efficient at it but

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:53,260
they they want to so this is there's

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:57,430
also people toss them in on a laptop

00:02:53,260 --> 00:03:00,670
install this guy install drivers these

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:03,300
regions and this is somewhere in between

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:08,440
the I'm trying really really hard and

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:12,700
I'm just going to really care about so

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,920
that's the and in the second and maybe

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,690
in one of one or both of the middle

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,060
categories is something we have

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,350
oversight from the project or some

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,980
relationship with the project is

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:28,080
probably lies as well yes yeah

00:03:25,980 --> 00:04:13,540
[Music]

00:03:28,080 --> 00:04:16,690
so that's the other conversation so we

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,579
were talking about the direct one of the

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,859
drivers from this conversation is that

00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,479
we want the value that the community is

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:26,110
giving to this platform to be

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,700
acknowledged as user from the right so

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,600
we want to indicate where the source of

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:34,810
value is - and this is important since

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,600
there's work to be done there's going to

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,450
be effort to implement this program or

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,250
to define the program or to enforce the

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,760
program or if we need additional bars

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,110
we're going to have to work on that so

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,830
anytime there's effort there should also

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,340
be a corresponding now

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,920
the value is that the market will become

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,550
aware more aware of the contribution of

00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,430
the community in the Debian pool right

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:05,600
as opposed to somebody else's for bank

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:07,100
event so just an important point right

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,750
then we're not just doing this for

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,490
random reason we're doing it because we

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,490
want to create value to the mark

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,889
[Music]

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,370
[Music]

00:06:48,760 --> 00:07:00,410
basically largely in my response is to

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,480
feel incoming email marketing what that

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,780
means is largely we haven't published my

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,180
policy

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,670
website where there's a lot of uses that

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,820
are permitted particular learner in

00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:16,230
regards to let's merchandising like

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,640
branding like t-shirts cups these kind

00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,440
of things where you don't need to ask

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,180
permission but there are certain cases

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,240
reusing that the permission and that

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,800
email address mission and any question

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,890
was about using the Deming favorite

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,440
person to that a lot of the email

00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,820
requests we get are can we put it on the

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,650
Hat and we point them in trademark

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,450
policy and said you're allowed to do

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:41,630
that you can need to ask with thank you

00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:43,490
frosting and such and such we're also

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:47,010
[Music]

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:51,660
responsible for advising the GPL on

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:54,200
trademark policy and the project on deep

00:07:51,660 --> 00:08:00,380
enough policy but it's not a

00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:03,630
conversation we can make on our own just

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:07,319
kind of bring some of the legal aspects

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:10,289
of technology conversation

00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:21,899
also we do interface with with lawyers

00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:23,580
to register for something trademark we

00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:36,919
have to have any trademark we are

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:39,209
working on because we actually with

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,949
Debian Rick Pitino with instead of

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:59,610
Justice room this was yeah basically

00:08:42,949 --> 00:09:01,500
just accordingly to power our partners

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:09,600
policies but that hasn't happened yet

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:20,430
commanded you to power so unless we

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:22,350
really internal before the current two

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,410
of you were active doing great mark

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,089
stuff there was there were these certain

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:31,319
cases where there was no lawsuit filed

00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:34,170
but there were cases where for example

00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:39,360
somebody unfriendly had the Debbie not

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:40,920
es domain name and there was maybe even

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,180
that ducky what might be confusing them

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,010
but you yeah and I think they were even

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,279
I think they were even redirecting it to

00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,990
of all things in Microsoft hosting site

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,970
or maybe they included a benign pipe

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:57,810
something totally not appropriate for

00:09:53,970 --> 00:10:00,540
Debbie and dotty you and I believe we

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,279
did have lawyers help deal with them and

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,259
make clear that we would be willing to

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,149
pursue the dispute resolution process I

00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,519
mean that did not actually have to

00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:10,230
happen I believe but once they realize

00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,199
we were serious I think we ended up

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,790
having I think we ended up having they

00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:17,189
negotiated some small payment from us to

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,380
them but it was like a token amount and

00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:20,360
we got it back so the

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,800
a bit of that has happened but it has

00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,580
never been to the legal lawyer

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:33,350
altogether

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:35,720
yeah the point was that you definitely

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,600
should register it Debian by itself to

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,190
swell at the word of Rodia we arrived in

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,660
okay so we do have Debbie in the word

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:47,300
mark registrar being with us and some of

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:57,860
the Madrid Protocol countries okay just

00:10:47,300 --> 00:11:12,230
the word Debbie yeah it's only

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:14,450
registered with the word but whenever

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:22,340
everybody comes in it like oh I saw her

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:25,310
alone we just had a request to grant

00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,780
Debian average for clarification and we

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:35,570
thought it was just for work or it's

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:37,400
basically naming the specimen Debbie

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,920
they type Debian on the bottom of the

00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,200
drawing I'm a trademark lawyer at Merton

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,500
and I use toward the trademark office so

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,180
been training my work about 25 years

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,070
unfortunately on the drawing of the mark

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,350
that was submitted they typed the word

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,630
Debian thinking it was for clarity

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,540
purposes but as soon as you put anything

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,660
else on the drawing page the mark that

00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:03,830
becomes part of your mark so it's very

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:06,650
simple for $300 we can just file another

00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:09,320
one for this world the squirrels are

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,410
registerable under the u.s. straight

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,460
back

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,460
[Music]

00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,600
[Music]

00:12:51,959 --> 00:13:10,299
they just saying I can go back to my

00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:12,789
room okay okay I can do that I'm

00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:15,789
perfectly willing to file a trademark

00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:20,229
application on any at any time you guys

00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:21,849
want Fernando and I just wanted to point

00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:23,919
out so this is one of the reasons why

00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:28,479
you want to do this right so Debbie and

00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:35,229
- hosting dot info right not a Debbie in

00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:40,239
the property right an indication then

00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:45,369
they use right they have your logo and

00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:46,929
the main swirl your typeset right and if

00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:48,909
you know the word mark is also in the

00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:50,619
domain name and branding okay everybody

00:13:48,909 --> 00:14:03,099
do that we never do with them you know

00:13:50,619 --> 00:14:05,139
but the question is have you losing in

00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:07,029
order to maintain ownership of the

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:09,159
trademark you have to control the nature

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,319
and quality of the goods provided under

00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:14,349
that trademark if you allow third

00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:17,920
parties to use the mark without you

00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:19,990
controlling the use through a license

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,649
then it essentially becomes public

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:26,680
domain so if you allow others to use an

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:29,050
unfettered banner then you will lose

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,420
your right to challenge the people you

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:34,709
don't like even if you let people you do

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:38,170
like use it in an unfettered manner

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:41,410
you're still you're letting it go it

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:54,250
becomes no longer indicates this is a

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:57,220
product of right now it's like the Train

00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,570
even end so that well you know loading

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,519
this means it's even aside from the

00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,850
legal requirements which is certainly

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,829
good to consider if you have a site

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,199
called Debian hosting as the main

00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:09,550
second-level label and domain name you

00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,699
might actually assume that it's won by

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:14,560
the Debian project in some way and if

00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:18,339
there's any problem with it whatsoever

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:21,519
or any shadiness or bad support it might

00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:23,800
make users think that we're doing a bad

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,690
job at something even though we have no

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,089
connection usually when you have a

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,730
registration for a word mark like Debian

00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:33,910
and someone puts it into a domain name

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,620
then you have a course of action to go

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,000
after them oh yeah we could totally we

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,100
could totally we don't have to go to the

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,269
court system you know means I can right

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,589
yeah exactly

00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:48,459
or I get to talk to them first yeah

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:51,130
talking first but the fact the fact that

00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:52,600
we were able to go to protecting you

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,970
it's a different system but we were able

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,459
to do the European equivalent of that

00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,230
dispute process gamers after leverage

00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:01,600
and we were willing to finita theorists

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,449
but once again going back to original

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,839
ball for the morning right what make

00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:10,480
itself yeah I would consider the hemming

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,130
size of website a good thing for them

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,329
because it's a British visibility as

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:18,080
long as as we agreed there might be some

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:22,550
kind of you know mutual

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:25,040
it would be never so like if it was

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:28,690
called like Bob is that being hosting or

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,910
like you know you know or like you know

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:34,940
Sorenson Debian like if it was providing

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,980
the Debian hosting service and did not

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,200
have quite some generic name and recent

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,610
agreement with us I don't see a problem

00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,470
with having Debian in the name if

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,170
they're actually serving Debian and we

00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,910
have some oversight to some degree right

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,650
so if it's just saying that we're

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,750
hosting you probably assume that it

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,580
connect to the Debian project provider

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,740
what the item assumes whenever it's Deb

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,860
in the port or digging the net base

00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:05,060
that's what I'm assuming it's gonna know

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:16,970
more than most people most people if

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:18,110
they are doing so if they are doing

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,790
things that are in the project's

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:23,449
interest and they should be very willing

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:25,610
to take a license - yeah in a way you're

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:29,180
not you're not losing the ability to the

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:32,960
horse is really losing the market as an

00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,190
indication of source you know you can

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,430
have that conversation with them but

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,290
this for example is intense use of and

00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,290
it's hard to see you would want to

00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:44,330
license one particular site to be Debbie

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:50,900
and her string as opposed to doing it

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:52,370
like you save Bob's and solving unless

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,980
they decided that they wanted to work

00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,660
within the Debian project to create a

00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,110
hosting servers that under the aegis of

00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,250
the DPL somehow and you know govern

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,840
through Debian properties that would be

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,090
a different guest except many of others

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,280
less well it's a different type of yes

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,700
you have to consider your trademark just

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,140
as important as keeping Microsoft or

00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,450
Amazon or anybody else would be like Oh

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,910
someone else can use my name and I

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,960
guarantee there is not a Microsoft -

00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,960
hosting right

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,120
I'm gonna beat that this is against

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:38,840
which shouldn't oh hell yeah unless we

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:42,510
permit I don't think we're in policy

00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,980
demands that they require they ask us

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:47,870
and we give the information they're

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:54,330
using Debian in a top-level domain

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:56,430
they're using our that's basically doing

00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:59,610
things that implies an endorsement from

00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:17,340
Debian vs. again and I think in this

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:19,200
case we would probably say no I mean

00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,770
they also require that certain parties

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:28,770
that putting that you know certain level

00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:30,870
of Fontan yeah prominence saying there

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,850
is a way to host Debian that we won't

00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,310
get mad at you know well you can't be

00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,740
the Debian hosting place it could be

00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:39,780
under your hosting yeah well I would

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,560
actually condemning the official Debian

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:46,230
yes that there this world a favor

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,410
Debian hosting the page and I wouldn't

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,880
even assume that info is unofficial

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,860
because it's admitting how many

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,870
consulates and empathise and think of

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,120
foreign countries have weird I met Don

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,190
info DS I've seen this bizarre well

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,370
sometimes the mark is owned by somebody

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,120
else or like there to be a Debian soda

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,920
or Debbie ants

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,820
cupcakes everybody have the mark first

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,820
then you get

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:23,120
I will just make one additional point

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:25,760
right with the licensing licensing does

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,620
imply that you have quality control and

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,810
it doesn't have to be like extreme

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,670
quality control but there may you may

00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:34,550
want to consider further down the line

00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:36,980
that you know there's a once-a-year

00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:39,560
check-in or some sort of like you have

00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:42,290
to send us a sample or check in with us

00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,510
and you know check these boxes once a

00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:48,440
year just to say that you're doing like

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:51,050
an annual quality control when for 118

00:20:48,440 --> 00:21:01,070
what context then first if I'm selling a

00:20:51,050 --> 00:21:03,290
hosting service appropriate but it

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:10,670
wasn't serviced so is the relevant

00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:13,580
measurement of quality for each type but

00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,890
is it sufficient for us to monitor how

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:19,400
they are using what they are doing in

00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:21,560
respect of that a use of the Debian name

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,840
and product or would we in this a case

00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,430
what we need to monitor if we wanted to

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,920
allow this what we need to monitor how

00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:32,090
the quality of the final hosting service

00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:35,030
to customers is where is the I mean you

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,310
could do loose monitoring of what like

00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,900
the end result is so you're saying

00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,340
you're saying it's up to us what the

00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,800
nature of it is as long as we're

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,690
satisfied that they're adhering to our

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,640
gear of what the brand should mean right

00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,070
yeah yes but then I think there should

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,830
be something like either annual or some

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:54,470
check back period so that because the

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:57,290
other thing is that you're applying the

00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,630
bar to these good bandage them I mean

00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,940
for hosting service if something happens

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,430
and someone wants to is really

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,700
dissatisfied and wants to sue they're

00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:10,010
going to be okay this is a debian

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,990
trademark good I'm suing Debian so if

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,040
you let somebody sell debian soda and

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,540
they get poison which is the other

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,520
reason if you let an Arab name if we

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,830
have a rule out of

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:23,320
like someone's Oh Debbie and Ethel so

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:24,100
it's a more than debian yeah although my

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,320
trademark

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:31,270
users a lot of trademarks don't do this

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,920
like like I'm I think I don't think

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:36,280
Rufus lik like let's say for example

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,770
that you're doing the let's say you're

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,830
doing something related to Android and

00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:43,870
you follow Google's Android policy for

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,900
just playing the robot on your website

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,610
or something I don't think there is any

00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,540
periodic having a human look at you in

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:54,130
any regard

00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:55,720
I mean they probably like renewal or I'm

00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,850
sure they have the right to change their

00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,050
terms in heaven and I'm sure they have

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,250
the right to change the terms and then

00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,200
sure they have the right to go after you

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,090
with if you stop complying with but I

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,400
don't think they have a requirement that

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,720
there's a periodic conversation and I

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,720
don't want other providers don't either

00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:16,030
it would he feel when I enter Kent maybe

00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,830
you monster question of when is that

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,350
when would it be allowed in this context

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:34,290
as descriptive hosting service and they

00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:38,530
just say we are you ready by the way

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:40,120
yeah so will you give a good friends of

00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:46,500
license for the copyright everything

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:49,150
simple may also be trademark embrasure

00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,170
but I mean if they could be are they

00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:54,450
would it be available for them legally

00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:57,570
to the needs permission if they just

00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,429
put it up and say we are using W and

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,440
have a happy picture that that means

00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:02,549
well is sort of like me as promptly as

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,409
this loud

00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:05,429
well I think for the copyright side I

00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,779
think we get ended up doing a pretty

00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:35,850
primitive that might be style license

00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:43,859
for the brilliant comes into the so but

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:45,509
if they wanted to say in or if they have

00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:47,070
a listing of all the images that you can

00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:51,629
load up on their cloud if they have a

00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:52,950
logo next to that so since it is 232 if

00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:55,889
you that's are their topics besides this

00:24:52,950 --> 00:25:00,570
book citation I was using in sings in

00:24:55,889 --> 00:25:02,779
yeah I'm an instructor it's good it's a

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,779
good example

00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,580
[Music]

00:25:38,690 --> 00:26:17,010
yeah well depends on who owns the yeah

00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:22,170
in this context we are delegated by the

00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:24,780
end effects of SPI there are historical

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,850
reasons for that basically Debian is

00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,950
associated in the US and if you can get

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:31,070
something trademark in the u.s. you're

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:33,950
pretty much assured that in almost every

00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:37,580
country in the Madrid Protocol Sun

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:40,890
Madrid for the fan treaty they will

00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:43,280
accept then you had a location at the

00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,280
blue bytes

00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,839
[Music]

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:33,940
and yeah according to that means

00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,250
trademark web page via the Madrid

00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,070
Protocol is protected in all the EU and

00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:44,710
China and Japan and separately it's also

00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:46,150
been registered in Brazil yeah extended

00:27:44,710 --> 00:28:04,179
via the mother protocol to all those

00:27:46,150 --> 00:28:07,030
except Roberto no waiting for the EU oh

00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:10,929
really okay it's not listed but I

00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:13,330
believe you and and I have taken a look

00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:15,700
at Canada's web page it would be easy to

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:18,809
attend it there if we cared

00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,809
[Music]

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:26,000
interaction countries

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,220
I just want to mention in many

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,160
jurisdictions where we may not have a

00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,810
formal filing we are we are also

00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:49,130
afforded some protection under common

00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:51,050
law where Asian countries but we have

00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,150
the two biggest right whoa

00:28:51,050 --> 00:29:00,980
two of the three two of the four biggest

00:28:53,150 --> 00:29:04,240
economies in Asia yeah Indian career the

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,240
others left head of mind right

00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:16,200
so I mean if you know lowest return for

00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:19,830
free Elsie has some small presence there

00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,559
but they were all so busy I can check

00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,320
with our Indian associates you like to

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,000
work for free

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,790
but like SF else he does have a brother

00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,300
through like Michigan Michigan wasn't in

00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,300
India I think

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:59,720
so penalty iin knowledge you know what

00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:02,030
we do does anyone have some comments on

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,660
if we do we should do more or different

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:07,130
things or are you happy origami so in

00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,250
the middle of the do are you sure if

00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:14,750
you're ready so just as a point of

00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:17,059
clarification the disappointed

00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:19,429
clarification we should probably so we

00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:24,650
have a wrench trade markets or work we

00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:27,290
here we have a registered Trade Center

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:29,390
in daily in the u.s. we haven't paid the

00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:35,870
extended into the grid because there's

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:38,090
like a little glitch problem neither one

00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,740
of those works or the third work that

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,900
you're talking about in Def Con is

00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,190
really suitable to the program that we

00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:59,360
were talking about the scoring

00:30:43,190 --> 00:31:01,400
I think some people within and you want

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,660
to select your minutes of choice because

00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,140
that's what you know what that's what

00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:20,540
you want

00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:24,110
sure so I totally understand where

00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:26,990
you're from my conversation earlier was

00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,600
we may need to create another one right

00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,740
that is like a powered by or approved by

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:38,090
that man

00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:39,500
that could be something well I was

00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,809
trying to work it through like whether

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,220
you wanted to have some sort of

00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:45,470
certification work like the Good

00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,540
Housekeeping Seal of Approval but

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,890
there's an anti use by owner so you

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,110
might have to come up with an offshoot

00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:54,650
mark and I don't know how far you could

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:57,020
if you could have Debian compliant or I

00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,970
was kidding with Bryan saying the Debian

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:03,280
swirl of approval or some you know

00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:05,690
Debian little logo thing they could say

00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,150
so as an example of that outside the

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:11,270
class case I was having the sort of

00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:15,110
variant of these two talks with someone

00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:17,150
downstairs before this and we were

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,760
talking about the case of hardware with

00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:21,950
Debian pre-installed and so in that

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,440
space we could have if people wanted to

00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:27,230
define the terms that we could have a

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,910
certified Debian Hardware mark because

00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:31,160
we don't reduce hardware and we don't

00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:34,880
label anything is that and similarly if

00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:36,470
there was some if there if we wanted to

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,050
have a mark that might apply the Debian

00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,370
cloud images are not made by Debian as

00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:43,250
opposed to the ones that are made by

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:47,230
Debian you know like you know they've

00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:52,160
been compatible or Debian or you know

00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:53,960
you know something there could be a

00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,240
variant right if but I don't think we

00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,250
need it if they're trying to get from

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,230
your first if they're trying to get into

00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,400
the second tier from your verb you're

00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,240
for to your version this morning where

00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,470
they're trying to phase close the

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,630
bottles with Debian and they're talking

00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,090
with us and compacting and complaining

00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,280
collaborating I think Debian is fine for

00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,020
that it's more the third tier if we

00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,670
wanted to have a mark where they're

00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,840
trying for the based operating system to

00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,120
legitimately be Debian and not a

00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:21,190
derivative but they're adding on other

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:24,410
stuff if we want it to say like you know

00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:27,559
modified Debian as a mark or like you

00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:29,620
know Debian plus or Dekker that that

00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:32,240
implies something different but you know

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:35,650
yeah Debian would add ons or something

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,650
that could be a market

00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:48,159
the original question for it for this

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:50,379
approval or you could just have a common

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,299
law trademark I mean common law

00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:54,609
certification where you'd have to call

00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:56,379
it a certification workers that means

00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:58,359
you're putting on what the debian steel

00:33:56,379 --> 00:34:01,479
swirl of approval on something that you

00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:03,669
may so if you started making hardware

00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:06,369
it's just you can't approve your own but

00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:09,039
if you're a certified so you would file

00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:12,399
a separate application could we define

00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:15,460
the rules for certification and allow a

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,079
different company as a certifier to

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,049
certify us as compliant with our own

00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:21,190
rules like if we if we can find the

00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:23,980
rules in a standard way

00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,270
maybe we certify others but we also

00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:32,649
allow other entities to do the

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:35,049
certification romana work only and for

00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:36,549
like vendor added on like like debian

00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:38,079
with add-ons it could work for that kind

00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:40,629
of thought of it it would only work for

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,510
things that are crew made by not right

00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:45,399
the only other candidate is donation of

00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:48,099
the cloud vendor wanting to make a new

00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:49,899
distro that's basically debian with some

00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:52,809
differences it could yeah there could be

00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:54,909
a class of certification mark that if

00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:57,940
you come through these hoops we will

00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:59,619
stamp you yeah the only caveat is that

00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,990
you're gonna have them you have that

00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:04,150
really specific rules because if you

00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:07,569
have a certification mark if you have

00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:10,660
100 roles and somebody even if somebody

00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:12,910
you don't like follows social hundred

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:17,090
years rules then you have to certify

00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:18,530
that you can we

00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,700
I think they agreed to not call it the

00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,730
certification but wouldn't it be

00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,710
possibly just a baby version number and

00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:27,350
then they are compiled with version 1

00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:34,220
but we bring out version 2 new year and

00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:35,960
then okay it's like if if we make a spec

00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,000
and they say that they're compliant to

00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,660
spec and they're not that's some problem

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,550
about false advertising no great yeah I

00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:47,450
don't lie to the spec but another no way

00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:52,670
which we approve to right we're going to

00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:55,430
say no spider or maybe the certification

00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,260
could mean that you like even with a

00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:59,180
certification mark like if it's the sort

00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,750
of thing where this certification needs

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:05,720
to be recertified every year and the

00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:08,180
definition may change and if we did that

00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,860
and then if we forgot to do that then if

00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:12,050
we add fiber to the definition and then

00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,730
within the next year and you get a clue

00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:18,260
then so that would also work with the

00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:20,300
mark as long as you as long as so

00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,520
there's the work that you do to create

00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:29,410
the program yeah then there's the work

00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:31,880
that you do to enforce yes fix this

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:35,450
which is Beck wouldn't require but we'd

00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:38,150
also please it less well yeah because

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,890
all we could do if they were claiming to

00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,540
be compliant and we were just probably

00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:44,120
complain to the FTC or similar agencies

00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,380
right we couldn't do more than that but

00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,160
if they're misusing our mark we could

00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:51,050
take more direct action right so if so

00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,940
if we want to be able to do more than

00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:55,730
complain to regulators we need to have

00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:59,510
them are how many do you think are out

00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:01,190
there that are how many people do think

00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:03,790
you would either be licensing or

00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,790
certifying

00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:19,960
I suspect that when more and more

00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:21,010
companies started hosting they just pop

00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:27,610
up left and right

00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:30,040
I expect them to especially since when

00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:33,190
we have a program which allows people to

00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:35,530
use our name that does add value to

00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:38,230
their program so I have a sudden people

00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:40,210
also want to get onto this bandwagon to

00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:44,080
also have to simplification no not

00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:47,640
sufficiently not to be so just for your

00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:50,890
information the official program over

00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,330
yeah but I think if you guys want to

00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,910
wrap up your feature but we don't

00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:58,410
probably discuss informally for a few

00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,410
