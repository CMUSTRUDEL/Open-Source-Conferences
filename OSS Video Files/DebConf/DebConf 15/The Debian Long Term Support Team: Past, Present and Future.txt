Almost anybody will acknowledge that maintaining 18000 software packages secure over 5 years is a challenge and even more so in the context of Debian where most volunteers tend to skip the parts that are not fun. Still the story of the Debian LTS team shows that it is possible. This talk will explain how we got started and where we are today.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,550
become our next talk will be about given

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:12,380
long times support team and the speakers

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:15,120
I fell here talk hello

00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,270
so yes today I will speak a bit about

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,050
Debian long-term support I guess most of

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,470
you already know other some people who

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:33,870
have no idea what it what this is about

00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:37,140
no good I will make my talk in 3 parts

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:42,960
mainly first I will present the team how

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:45,300
it works I will also give some facts

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,270
about how it evolved over the first

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,920
years I took some time to collect the

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,820
statistics I believe they are rather

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,949
interesting I will also speak about the

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,530
future but there will be a separate

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,370
discussion about this you know both

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:05,909
later this week and I will show you how

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,360
to help because like any other team in

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,880
Devon is open to anyone and we welcome

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:18,750
help at the end I will answer your

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:20,939
question so first part what is long-term

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,900
support our about what we are the

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:30,450
problem when we created the team and the

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:34,799
choice we made so the idea the really

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:38,579
simple we wanted to extend support

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,070
period of all the band releases so you

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,110
know currently it's basically one year

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,040
until the next table release comes out

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,380
and we wanted to extend this to 5 years

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,280
too much at least

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:56,750
Ubuntu is offering which is not our

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,250
competitor but for the companies were

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:03,000
medic making choices it's one of the

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:07,920
important criteria so we want to do as

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,060
well well basically it's one year next

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,560
after the next table but since we

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:18,510
publish news table is it

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:22,380
two years it's roughly three years a

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,720
nice side benefit is that user can skip

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,239
a full release

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,230
while we don't officially support this

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:34,530
upgrade or over going from there in six

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,810
to seven eight you can do to deter

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:42,870
grades at the same time and limiting the

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:44,160
downtime to once every five years by the

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,920
way in practice

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,810
distel grades ten to one server on

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,130
simple server configuration tends to

00:02:48,810 --> 00:03:00,630
work rather well even across two

00:02:53,130 --> 00:03:03,390
releases so keeping the distribution

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:07,049
shaker for five years is a real

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:10,500
challenge it is hard work but not

00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:12,599
everybody is willing to do I mean in

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,230
Debian all the work is done by

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,570
volunteers and volunteers do the work

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,359
they enjoy Angie generally we enjoy

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:24,989
working on new features on top of latest

00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:28,019
release and not really on backporting

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:33,569
patches to code that was written five

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:36,420
years ago the security team has limited

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:39,569
resources so we could not just ask the

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,780
restric security team to hey so now do

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:45,750
twice the work but still they were

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,750
really interested in the in the project

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:53,120
and wanted to support the idea and

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,120
really helped to get it bootstrapped

00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:01,579
on the security team and slightly larger

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:05,850
scope they support all our key churches

00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:08,940
which means you have a lot of pron of

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:12,690
coordination when a secretive dates do

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:17,090
not compile and stuff like that so what

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:20,209
did we do we restricted

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,490
the scope by picking the two most

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:27,710
popular architectures that's real that

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:30,800
most user care about we have we have had

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:33,980
some demand for arm architectures but up

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:39,230
to now we only support amd64 honey

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:41,930
386 and we also excluded some package

00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:47,030
from the security support either because

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:49,550
they are taking too much time I mean

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:53,270
they have a security issue every two

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:58,130
weeks and well then very hard to support

00:04:53,270 --> 00:05:01,030
or well or it can also be that upstream

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:05,480
is not cooperative enough to be able to

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:07,910
support it this list was basically made

00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,810
by the current security team based on

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:17,720
their experience of of doing security

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:19,010
support still there are if you look up

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,710
this list there are some important

00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:26,030
restrictions there's no plans there is

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:28,040
no KVM there's no race

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:34,280
there's no browser there's no ID with

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:37,550
and chromium so it sucks a bit but it's

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,360
a way to get it started but I think we

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:45,919
can do better for wizzy

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:50,260
so basically there's no virtualization

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,260
support on the host only on the quest

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:59,050
so yes the secretary team apt bootstraps

00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,890
LTH team but it's not the same team

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,140
obviously there are members of the

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:07,880
security team who work also in the IDS

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:10,729
team and the when we work in close

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,720
cooperation we have a regular contact

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:16,520
and they watch our mailing lists etc but

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,760
the policy are different and the

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,769
infrastructure is separate which is a

00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,719
problem that

00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:26,119
- this about later so we have a

00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:28,699
dedicated mailing list Davian - LTS at

00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,860
least that they are not org are not

00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:39,589
dedicated piracy channel as well a

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:41,599
welcome to subscribe and to join so it's

00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:45,099
a new team it means also new people new

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,099
members so where do they come from

00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:52,309
the first idea was to get help from

00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:55,819
people in various companies were already

00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:58,659
doing such in-house support we had

00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:01,489
contact with electricity the house EDF

00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:04,489
with doing that and we still have but

00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:07,009
they were one of the first company who

00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:08,389
was pushing for this because they said

00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,419
while we're basically doing it already

00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:13,699
we can share it with other companies so

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:16,669
the idea was ready to pull security

00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,679
support of multiple companies so we sent

00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:24,889
a press release that Kim companies to

00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:26,809
join and we are a few response but come

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,929
back later to how it evolved it's not

00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:34,069
really satisfying the other thing we did

00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:37,129
is that we offered companies to fund the

00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:41,989
project to bring money and use this

00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:44,209
money to pay the work of actually even

00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:48,069
completely different contributors to do

00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:51,379
the security updates that we need so

00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:55,579
basically we have a wiki pages listing

00:07:51,379 --> 00:08:02,689
all the way companies come help with

00:07:55,579 --> 00:08:05,029
money but in practice most of the

00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:08,349
wanting to be to be paid contributors

00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:12,079
join together under a single offer

00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:18,079
managed by frictional which is my own

00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:22,939
company so I explained you quickly how

00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:28,029
this works so basically most companies

00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:34,200
want to don't want to bother bringing

00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:37,410
human resources and bring money by

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,640
long-term support contracts - cool -

00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:47,190
freak show and basically we were irate I

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:51,780
mean when you give 85 viewers you found

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:55,160
one hour of LTS work this is the current

00:08:51,780 --> 00:09:00,000
list of sponsors if you want top-level

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:08,370
sponsors answering more than one day of

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,900
work per month that's Citra so and on

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,140
the other side we have Debian

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,970
contributors that are doing the work and

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,860
friction is paying them there are small

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,290
difference between the right to cover

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,170
administrative cost because well I have

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,820
to under haul the invoices some

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,560
customers are using PayPal which is

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,560
taking a cut at suit right side chateau

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:38,700
and well what we we asked contributors

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:41,280
to follow some rules and among those

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,230
rules is the requirement to publish a

00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,990
monthly report of the work down on pad

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:50,730
time so they won't get paid until they

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:56,730
have published a report so everybody can

00:09:50,730 --> 00:10:01,320
know how the money has been spent oh yes

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:03,390
that's the way it works currently we

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:10,130
have seven different contributors and

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:13,740
about thirty sponsors so some figures

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:17,010
who applauded packages how did they

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,980
evolve since July last year of June last

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,350
year how is a fun thing evolving so I

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,770
just updated those figures a few days

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:28,440
ago I made man I use this took a first

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:36,050
time in e-mini debconf o in much but are

00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:39,420
you dated again so the number of we plot

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:42,120
it's roughly over one year one year not

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,450
one months since we started in July last

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,450
year

00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:53,910
over 300 the applaud so it's not so much

00:10:50,760 --> 00:11:00,300
but still almost one AD per day so it's

00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:03,930
significant work I have given a plate

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:09,090
here who paid for the work mostly who

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:11,960
and who did it on the left so friction

00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,460
is sponsoring most

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,770
friction point sort of not friction

00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:22,140
itself the sponsor will bring money to

00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:24,990
fix most of the known is a separate

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,670
category for grouping old maintainer I

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,810
mean there are maintenance who are

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:33,870
taking care of their own packages in in

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:36,060
LTS in squeeze right now security team

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:40,380
is member our members of security team

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:43,640
who works also within the LTS team EDF

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:46,800
is electricity the force individuals are

00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,350
Debian developers that I've listed

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,050
themselves of member of the LTS team and

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,340
who did we plus not for the own package

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:57,960
but for package of auto maintenance

00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:02,190
relative the German company that you

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:07,710
know probably we have a booth here she

00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:12,990
want a job Toshiba invention catalyst

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:17,310
it's wrong rather lower fees on the

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:21,840
right you have people so the top five

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:28,890
people are paid bar by friction our file

00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:32,880
is working for EDF each is a member of

00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:35,970
the security team QT is open SSL

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,720
maintainer so at and he keeps maintains

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:43,020
his own packages got a lot of work Mike

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,300
is also paid by frictional Christopher B

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,460
dough is mainly maintaining the Debian

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,990
security Support Package in squeeze LTS

00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,610
and green Kong is employed by Toshiba

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,640
etcetra etcetra

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:58,560
Christoph bag is employed by credit of

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:04,110
doing PostgreSQL

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:08,310
maintenance so how did it evolve over

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:11,249
the year again it's by affiliation so

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:15,509
the big blue part is people paid

00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:20,910
contributors and you don't see it very

00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:25,079
well but the part about maintainer is

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,790
this one it tends to in to to do better

00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:30,839
of the month because this year we

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:32,879
started to contact maintain errs every

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,939
time that we have a new plot the coming

00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,980
up we we ask them first do you want to

00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:43,589
undelete to yourself or do you want and

00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:47,430
so it it slightly increased but as you

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:50,009
see the contribution of other companies

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:54,290
have not really increased over time and

00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:59,670
rather disappeared it's unfortunate but

00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:05,670
it looks like paid contributors more

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:10,500
proactive and also in particular with

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:13,620
EDF say they do the work but with some

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:18,120
lag and we're faster so they just reuse

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:21,480
what we have done and they I wanted to

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:26,370
talk with Rafael I tried to see how we

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:29,970
can do better for this but how did it

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,680
how did the sponsor ship level evolve so

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:35,160
we have a steady increase that's rather

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,970
nice it's not a huge amount but it's

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:44,519
significant because well we found almost

00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:48,329
80 hours per month it's close to our

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:54,149
first goal we wanted to that amount to

00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:59,970
be able to sustain ourselves if you look

00:14:54,149 --> 00:15:03,480
at the way it's value sponsors we have a

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,459
few big ones and possibly one very big I

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,300
can't give the name officially yet so I

00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:10,940
want that it will be a big jump in terms

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,930
of in the graph

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:17,660
she called and many small and many small

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:20,000
sponsors it's really what I'm after I

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,910
don't want to be dependent too much on

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,150
one big sponsors I really prefer many

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,400
sponsor while doing small donations but

00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,640
donations that are just enable your

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,730
after year because we're not here for

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:40,370
one year or two we want to do that over

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:42,470
the long term so you have some figures

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:47,450
about how many hours have been found and

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:48,710
see from this chart by the way if you

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:53,440
have any question you feel free to

00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,440
interrupt me I can take them at any time

00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:02,930
that's it for so evolution know the

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,440
future so what do we expect for the

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,400
future

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,040
first keep doing what we have up to keep

00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,020
supporting the current set of packages

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,970
but for we see long-term support we

00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,730
would really like to have more supported

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:21,640
package I mean a browser would be nice

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:25,280
for desktop deployment and really

00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:29,660
virtualization support is important for

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:35,080
many many companies so we should be able

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:38,270
to support something here also we want

00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:42,200
to avoid some pitfalls that we had with

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:44,900
squizzle yes as you know LTS users are

00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:48,920
currently required to add a separate

00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:52,940
source list entry with quiz - LTS report

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,730
repository and the security dot debian

00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:59,120
dot work squeeze repository is even used

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:01,640
so it's it should be possible for the

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,920
LTS team to continue using the same

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:08,030
repository as a security team when she

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:14,990
not on it no longer uses it so this will

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:16,579
be the topic Oh above next week by the

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,270
way I've given the the dated some

00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:24,910
Tuesday at 18 in the room up in the

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:27,530
first floor I'm so done so

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:30,590
what's the problem with supporting the

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:33,620
current set of packages for example we

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:36,950
have MySQL right now in squeezed LTS

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:41,480
version 5.1 which is no longer supported

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:43,670
by Oracle and when don't even know if

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,700
it's affected by security big issue

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:50,570
because Oracle doesn't give info on non

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,130
support release so this is a problem we

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,210
should consider switching to a newer

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,800
version but newer versions the involve

00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:01,210
library transition which is not really

00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:05,110
nice in a long-term support related so

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,100
there is some work to do if we want to

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:10,490
do something serious

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:15,260
and we have all the problem a lot of

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:17,270
package which are similar from time to

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,200
time with back part we take newer

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:25,130
operations we did that for Wireshark for

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:28,700
example well this is what I said before

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:31,670
we limited scope sucks we want to be

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:35,200
able to support more packages and we

00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,200
need more support for this yes

00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:43,940
speaking of fire shark speaking of your

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,850
Bioshock we switch to V this version

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,390
yes portal busy so it's solved yes

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,350
exactly

00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,220
that's what I just said wait wait it

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,990
used to be a problem

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,990
not support I did not update since much

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:04,670
well again what I just said before so I

00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:07,430
skip it yes additionally the problem

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,900
with a separate repository is that there

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,520
is a propagation delay to the mirror

00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:16,550
that we don't every sacred that

00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:21,170
definite organ so I will speak a bit of

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:23,540
how the team works basically the first

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:26,180
step is through aging new security issue

00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:29,930
so we have a list of CDE that comes in

00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:33,730
and they are added to a text file data -

00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:36,020
TV - Lee / TV is released

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,380
someone dispatches thousand source

00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:41,400
packages

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:44,250
then someone else review or usually some

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,740
in our case it's someone else review the

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,540
statues in each release members of the

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,850
LTS team review is that you since quiz

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,850
and remember sacred city team reviews

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:57,050
that using whiskey and Jessie and then

00:19:53,850 --> 00:20:01,050
we decide what we must do with package

00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:03,360
depending on the analysis either we say

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:07,860
well we need to prepare updates so we

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,680
added to data /d la - needed takes tear

00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,230
and someone will have to take care of

00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,960
papering zip date or we say the issue

00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,750
does not apply it's not does not does

00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,520
not affect the current version are we in

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,300
your it because the package is and

00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:28,550
support it or because the issue is

00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:31,710
really minor minor and not ever you know

00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:34,230
sometimes it can be that this issue is

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:40,620
already fixed in Debian due to some

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:42,900
maintainer choices when we do this

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,390
classification we contact the maintainer

00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:49,340
to keep him in the loop and offering the

00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:51,480
the possibility to help us here's what's

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:56,430
such the text file looks like

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:58,680
so the bold line is the lines that we

00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:03,300
are adding when we have decided what we

00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:07,940
are doing with the packages this is all

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,940
in the subversion repository on alias

00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:14,400
well then there's someone who's has to

00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:18,630
prepare the secret update basically

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,410
looking for a patch it's often useful to

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:24,660
be able to look up at reddit or Ubuntu

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:26,700
or obscene best cases upstream because

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:30,620
there are nice upstream we are providing

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:33,930
patches also for older versions that's

00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:36,240
usually there are already patches

00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,730
available not always for the good

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,760
version so sometimes we have to back

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:46,230
port it then we prepare new plot which

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:50,679
is plus step six you X suffix that we're

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:54,529
using nor forsake updates stable update

00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:59,149
well this is a resin knowing territory

00:21:54,529 --> 00:22:01,969
from package maintainer this is the

00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:08,029
hardest part sometimes testings update

00:22:01,969 --> 00:22:11,419
making sure that the issue is fixed one

00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:13,159
tools have test to it is it's nice but

00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:18,109
sometimes we have to share a bit

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:21,379
yourself sometimes it's too hard so we

00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:24,139
tend to add a safety measure to mail the

00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:29,299
mailing list and say okay I've done my

00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:32,080
best but please double-check it doesn't

00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:34,849
happen often that we have tears but some

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,669
LTS user are willing to test it before

00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:40,639
hunt and it would be really nice if you

00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:44,499
had more of those and if you don't give

00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:44,499
any negative feedbacks and we upload

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:52,359
then you have to send an announce we

00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:56,119
call that DLA for Debian LTS advisory

00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:59,210
and we have a little script bin Gandil a

00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:01,700
PLA that generates the templates mail

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,219
and you have to add a little bit of

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:08,929
description and basically send it to

00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:12,589
Debian LTS announced with gpgc

00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:17,419
signature of someone in the JD or DMK

00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:21,409
ring hearing the process is rather open

00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:24,469
to all my antennas so accepts of or no

00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:26,509
even the the bright writes to the secure

00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:30,379
testing repository where we have this

00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:31,909
data TV a list file is writable by all

00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:37,039
Debian developer scenarios

00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:40,159
so really the entrance / ear is rather

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:46,309
low for Debian maintenance and Debian

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:48,229
developers yes the other file which is

00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:50,690
automatically updated when you generate

00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:55,519
this template and which will update the

00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:58,039
tracker on the web pages because all

00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:02,080
this data is nicely browse able on

00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:07,190
security - tracker dot Debian dot org

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:12,710
and it's all linked from the package

00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:17,290
tracker that's it so if you have your

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,290
question I'm here to answer you

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,009
using the old client library and

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:46,669
operating the server so that you have

00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:49,850
the same API for clients but or same ABI

00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:53,389
four times a new server that actually

00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:55,820
gets security patches in my head yes but

00:24:53,389 --> 00:25:01,700
we did not look further yet I really

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:06,320
wanted to use the Buffs that is upcoming

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:10,429
to discuss it because as I said the

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,710
amount of funding we have allows us

00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:16,600
right now to keep up with secretive date

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:21,289
but we do not have many spare cycles for

00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,629
dealing with such things but it's slowly

00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:27,259
coming up as I said there is potentially

00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:30,980
a new platinum sponsor so we will have a

00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:32,750
few hours is a free to look into this

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,419
and I think it's probably the best

00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:43,210
solution but I don't know if it works in

00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:49,870
practice I have not tried it and since

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:49,870
the end of squeeze too far away so it's

00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:18,919
a bit of both

00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:21,799
actually I have I mean the webpage has

00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,399
always been very clear on the rules that

00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:28,669
means any Debian developers who was made

00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:32,919
secret to plot on its own already can

00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:35,000
apply and join the program and be funded

00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,250
fortunately I did not have too many

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,960
because it would have been hard but it

00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,900
has been steadily growing over the

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:46,130
months so last year there were

00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:48,350
only to Austin or gurney but in the

00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:51,710
meantime we got painted cheeks which is

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:55,850
helping us the colonel and a few more so

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:58,280
I I'm always looking trying to make sure

00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:01,460
that we don't give too much money to a

00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,040
single person because well it's Debian

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:07,910
there has been tank-tank in the past

00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:11,350
I've been involved I know it I don't

00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:15,200
want anyone to 12 it life depend on MA

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,790
my LTS work really and I don't want the

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,580
opposite way also LTS to depend on a

00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:24,230
single person that can go away so I try

00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:27,140
to limit it to well maximum 20 30 hours

00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:31,700
per month for each person and right now

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:34,400
we're well below that so it's good by

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:37,640
the way most Debian developers are

00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:41,630
currently European so the fact that

00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,700
everything is your based is fine but we

00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:47,600
have one developers uses American and

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:51,260
it's no problem to pay in dollars so the

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,980
amount will vary with the rates but it's

00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,160
not a problem

00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:59,240
and even more I'm surprised to have no

00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:04,280
contributions in the in countries where

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:07,010
the rate of labor is way below I mean if

00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,050
we have South American contributors or

00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,960
African or I don't know I don't want to

00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:16,100
stigmatize anyone but if there are

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:19,880
people who could live for much more I

00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:23,150
mean you can if they would be paid 10

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,920
hours they have made them months they

00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:28,940
can still join it's not a problem is

00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:31,070
it's not a high right because we want on

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,610
your parents it's because we want to

00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:37,670
hello everybody and if they can be bed

00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:39,410
14 10 hours by friction and then spend

00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:43,580
the rest of the month doing free work on

00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:46,160
Debian so better so I mean if you want

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:50,180
to join the program get in touch there

00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:53,560
are the tiles on the web pages and the

00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,560
more people found on the better

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,860
how do you or other developers and

00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,140
motivate yourself to do this kind of LTS

00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,690
work because obviously it's important

00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:10,120
for companies and to have stable

00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:12,160
releases but it also from to me release

00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:17,850
doesn't seem very exciting from a

00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:20,350
technology standpoint do you think it's

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,240
exciting or not exciting I did not

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:31,450
I'm not sure it understood not exciting

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:33,220
okay I agree it's not exciting but a bit

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,440
of both a bit of both I want again to

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,300
succeed and I know that

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,160
LTS support is important for Debian to

00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,740
succeed so I want to make sure the

00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,750
project is working well and alive but

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:48,820
clearly if the work I'm doing it I'm

00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:51,190
doing it because let's say the secretary

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,470
support work providing secretive date

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,110
back protein code is for money and

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:59,260
because I need to live but organizing

00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:02,470
organizing the LTS project is something

00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:07,300
I do for free because I want it for

00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:09,880
Debian because Debbie needs it hi I have

00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:14,500
a question who handles the public

00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:17,340
relations the marketing stuff of support

00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,850
do you do it yourself or do you have

00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,720
professional help

00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:26,500
I do not have any professional basically

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:30,040
the way we why we could do much better I

00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,830
mean number of sponsors I mean there are

00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:36,510
almost no us-based sponsors there there

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:42,850
are lots of US companies that could help

00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:45,910
but it's true I'm fighting between my

00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:49,930
time spending free time Debian LTL

00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:51,850
Stefan and I I contact a few companies

00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:55,660
that people suggest me to contact but

00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:57,700
I'm not doing much things by myself so

00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,050
you would benefit a lot from some

00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:03,640
professional help in the marketing

00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:06,770
department or yes yes but I mean I don't

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,630
have money for to fund this or not much

00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:11,000
I mean the difference is for

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,160
administrative cost uh you know maybe a

00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,280
bit for for this kind of stuff but it

00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:20,600
doesn't like a lot for policies okay I

00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,000
just wanted to answer the previous

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,790
question about finding motivation for

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,220
providing patches for LTS packages and

00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:31,480
in my view it's not very different from

00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:34,100
providing security patches for stable

00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,860
sometimes it's a bit it's a bit harder

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,200
because the software is a bit older but

00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,720
we overcome this situation for bearish

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,360
by a shark for example by updating by a

00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:48,770
shark because it was quite impossible to

00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:51,050
do back what all the security fixes and

00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:53,360
it's I think it's part of the

00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:56,360
maintenance if you maintain a project

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,270
you should maintain the security issues

00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,790
in stable and if you care a bit more and

00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:04,640
if you have a little more time you can't

00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:08,090
care about it the package in at the SS

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,240
valve I did it for buyer shark for free

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:18,290
because it's easy for me it's a great

00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:20,450
thank you I want to point out that it's

00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,580
good thing that LTS antiquity is

00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,830
different because we can have different

00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,170
policy like we said I'm putting a new

00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:30,500
extreme version is a something we can do

00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:32,630
when well it doesn't break too much I

00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,940
mean the into command-line interface has

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,890
not changed so so badly between both

00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,820
versions so it's it what possible it's

00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:43,070
not possible for all projects but we're

00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,320
not so strict on new Epson version and

00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:49,670
if you look at what others have been

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:52,850
doing even in Revit they do import image

00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:56,410
conversion quite often in fact even on

00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,410
libraries like NSS

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:07,929
so did you like party a super-dense

00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,649
report was an issue with the companies

00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:21,700
you are working on while sponsoring exam

00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:23,640
and not trying this was free was that an

00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:28,390
issue with the companies walk you know

00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:30,970
with who a sponsoring your walk well yes

00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:35,429
obviously bro zone not so much I mean

00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:37,929
most bouncer posters and stuff like that

00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:41,320
but they were I know it by the lack of

00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:44,440
queuing New York's and supports they did

00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:48,100
upgrade their host machine but not the

00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,649
quest machine on their other customers

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:53,020
obviously that would be the first

00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:56,200
priority to fix browser is nice but it's

00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:58,750
also one of those cases where we just

00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,659
need to back to integrate new eruption

00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:04,120
rations so it's a matter of someone

00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:07,450
doing it and I was hoping for

00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:16,720
al-jazeera to do it because it does it

00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:21,210
for electricity default I'll come to it

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:25,589
I know him quite well it's working in

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,589
Nyonya me that's far away

00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:40,560
having sponsors for doing the atmosphere

00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:43,639
is a signal of the need for LTS versions

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:51,149
but do you have additional statistics on

00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:54,389
the usage of LTS all not really

00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:56,369
and since LTS is not Austin and security

00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:59,640
mirrors but on all mirrors we don't have

00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:04,830
access to all the statistics but I know

00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:06,090
from males so thanks males and stuff

00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:09,300
like that that it's really appreciated

00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:12,020
and use quite a lot even from end users

00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:17,369
I mean there there are users who like so

00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:23,220
antiquated chrome stuff I'm fine with

00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:34,080
gnome 3 by the way yes well it's really

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:37,290
widely used widely appreciated thanks

00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:43,190
for your attention there will be a break

00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:43,190
