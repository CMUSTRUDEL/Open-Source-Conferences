Databases are great at remembering things, but most of the time we only let them know what the current state of the world is. Temporal tables are the database equivalent of using version control -- allowing you not only to see how things are now, but also to be able to see how things used to be, and who changed them and why.

brithint is a python tool that uses temporal tables to manage britney's hints database, so that it's possible to track when hints were introduced or removed, who they were introduced by -- and even better, it's possible to review that data to see where the release team gets bottlenecked.
