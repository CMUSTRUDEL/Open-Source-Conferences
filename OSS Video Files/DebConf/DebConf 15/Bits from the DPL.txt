grab a seat please there lots of seats

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:13,980
around here or there it's my pleasure to

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,660
introduce our current son new DP l Neil

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:25,820
McGovern for with annual bits from the

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:28,590
DPL thanks very much hi everyone

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,810
so I'm aware that this talk is due to

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,230
cutting to lunch so I'll try and keep it

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:38,190
slightly into dinner so if it's slightly

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,290
more more refine so it's a so people can

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,110
get their food early hopefully

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,539
everyone's okay with that anyway I'm

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,850
also kind of glad that it's in this this

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,320
slot when he was originally proposed and

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,690
I got my initial timeslot he was going

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,539
to be a a 9:00 a.m. slot just after the

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,000
cheese and wine party so I probably

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:03,120
wouldn't expect quite quite so many

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,750
people as we have here today so yeah

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,140
welcome everyone this final day of the

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:14,010
open weekend so anyone who isn't a

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,009
regular person hi and welcome to Debian

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,950
and welcome to the huge Debian family

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,810
which is certainly growing all the time

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,840
and and something that's that's really

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,369
good to see it's quite fantastic that

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,090
there's just so many people involved

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:33,390
especially this year so when I last

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,310
checked the stats I think we had three

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,710
hundred and eighty three people who had

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:44,759
so far checked in slightly less then

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:46,560
four dead calm seven but I'm certain I'm

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,630
certain over the next few days that

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,310
that'll grow up and definitely surpass

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:56,130
us and they just won't so remind

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,710
everyone what the size of the project we

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,960
are it's such a huge effort one of the

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,290
biggest open source and free software

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,290
projects in the world combining around

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,780
thousand developers few thousand

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,090
maintainer xand contributors as well and

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,819
also all our users it is a really huge

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,299
effort

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:17,790
we've managed to still be here after 22

00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,469
years and still be going strong

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,450
hopefully a debconf in future will look

00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:25,629
a little bit like that I think the orga

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,939
team might be slightly more stressed if

00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:30,519
we end up with numbers but what a

00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:33,129
fantastic thing and also over the last

00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,349
few years we've had 42 new project

00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:37,379
members have joined us so this is over

00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:46,810
the last year we've had all these people

00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:49,170
huge welcome to everyone there and it's

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,919
especially one or two on there which I

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,959
decided to get back into doing

00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:56,200
application management it's especially

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,200
for our non uploading developers as well

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,939
which has been o which has been which

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,079
has been a huge boost to really sort of

00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:08,500
grow where we're going and also welcome

00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:10,540
back I noticed a few people this year

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,329
who I haven't seen in a few years so

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,099
stand up if you've if you've been away

00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,590
for a few years and you're returning I

00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:23,560
know there's certainly some people

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:27,459
excellent polymath there he is and Chris

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,879
Rose as well is he here Oh excellent

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:33,430
you've been a being was active before I

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,379
even joined Debian and then essentially

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,209
has come back again so it's great to see

00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:40,290
everyone back and thanks very much for

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:43,750
remembering us and coming back again

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:47,049
there's been a few new people as well

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,720
very very new people who I haven't kind

00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:52,239
of seen around before in previous comps

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,919
and where did all these children come

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,720
from I think there must have been maybe

00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,970
well

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,560
I thought I think I think in the

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,630
Switzerland dead Kampf there might have

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,980
been something in the water because it's

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,660
suddenly been a huge job but it's

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,110
absolutely fantastic and it's really

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,760
fantastic to see not only our usual

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,400
developers around but their families as

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,680
well and new people being introduced to

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,000
to Debian anti-technology the tech kids

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,580
workshops think are absolutely fantastic

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,400
initiatives that that really solve helps

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:32,480
broaden Debian and and what we and what

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:35,340
we do so when I first came deeply I

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,280
always knew Debian was a big thing in

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,710
free software and in the communities and

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,980
then things we do but I went along to my

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,080
running Club and we went for a run went

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,700
to the pub afterwards as you do in the

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,040
UK of can't have support without

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,160
excessive alcohol consumption afterwards

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,590
so it seems and about seven or eight

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,630
people all came up to me and said hey

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:03,450
congratulations on being DP oh I'm going

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:07,470
to buy you a pint and rich which is

00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:09,120
great so if anyone wants to run for DP

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,970
out you get free beer this is a good

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,270
thing but it doesn't really impress on

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,460
me that Debian is a big deal now it's a

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,680
really huge deal if we have a look at

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,800
some of the latest server stats for like

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,280
web servers Debian's number one it's

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,080
about 32 percent of Linux distributions

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,080
and if you combine a bun too as well and

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,700
all our derivatives were above 62

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,310
percent of all the Linux servers out

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,160
there so we really basically Debian

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,680
really does run the world there's not

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,210
only that but the amount of embedded

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:48,570
devices that Debian's involved with from

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:52,979
as mentioned before the the HP talk from

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,640
running huge Teleco systems to assistive

00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,590
devices

00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:00,600
I know Andy's around somewhere new and

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,750
that product is essentially being based

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,740
on Debian and it's a essentially is

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:10,660
essentially a Speak & Spell type device

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,790
so is for people who can't talk

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,820
you have a little keyboard you type in

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:17,290
what you want to say it has predictive

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,840
technology in there and then it gives

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:22,300
people a voice so Debian is literally

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,120
peeing gear used to give people voices

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,100
who can't speak and this is a sort of

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,780
impact that that Debian can have and

00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,160
that free software can have on the world

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,670
so a few things happened certainly over

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,670
the last year

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,990
apparently we release so so I was only

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,880
DPL for about a week but I'm going to

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:47,260
take credit for this like any good poet

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,120
any good politician anyway so in post

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:54,190
release and I already had a stable

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,860
release this this was hugely welcomed I

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,470
don't know if anyone followed the DevOps

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,330
tumblr page or something but they were

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,370
following along and huge tears from

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:08,290
everyone when Debian releases it is a

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:13,390
big deal strangely I also saw a press

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:16,300
release that said they're having a party

00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:19,900
to celebrate the release of Debian 8 at

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:26,560
Linux fest Northwest but this word press

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:28,120
release was from Microsoft I thought it

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,100
might be a spoof at first but I

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,440
diligently checked the certificates and

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,050
the domains and made sure we went back I

00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,419
think people are certainly large

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,180
organizations who are realizing now that

00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:41,380
this open source free software thing

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,350
isn't going away

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,390
that this isn't something that they can

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,130
just ignore or they can fight against

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,490
it's something that they have to embrace

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:55,090
and certainly for someone like Microsoft

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,710
to throw away load a cake and do a press

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,620
release because Debian's released is

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,180
something I I never thought I'd see when

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,590
when I first joined since join the

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,750
Debian project and we've had seen you a

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:11,400
few new good things which is started

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,660
recently as well so fantastic areas if

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,590
anyone knows what this might be for a

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:20,140
current initiative that's going on

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,260
trying to reproducible builds they all

00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,880
sort of look the same so near enough

00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:29,000
it's the nearest I could find on Flickr

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,210
to something being reproducible these

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,220
are all CC by the way fantastic thing so

00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:38,570
this is perhaps a a bit of a better

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:43,010
slide too to explain just how impressive

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:45,500
it is where we've got so I don't know if

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,360
everyone's here is aware of reproducible

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,240
builds and what this is trying to do and

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,850
the importance of it when you get a

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,890
source package and you produce a binary

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,800
from that there hasn't traditionally

00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,840
been a way of knowing that what you've

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,210
produced here comes from this source

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,640
package and it hasn't been tampered with

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,160
this is incredibly important if you are

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,100
fought for the trust that people have in

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,410
Debian and how we produce things and so

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,300
if we're able to say look this thing

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,310
here has definitely come from here look

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,680
we've rebuilt it again you can check for

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,810
yourself it comes from here then people

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,200
can trust Debian as this platform for

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:27,740
where for where we we we run that

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,630
everyone's computers and I just quite

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,740
impressive the remarkable progress we've

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:36,320
seen here from zero to a huge share of

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,560
things being reproducible and that work

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,930
I'm sure will continue especially thanks

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:47,180
to the Linux Foundation's grants as well

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:51,380
and supporting this progress I did a ask

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:53,060
me anything recently and it was one of

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,360
the things that came up as being a

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,680
hugely popular thing that that Debian is

00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,600
doing and that and that we're driving

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,480
forward not just for Debian itself but

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,120
for all distributions and making sure

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,120
were able to do that interesting I was

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,250
also asked what I'm most jealous of of

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,870
other distributions and I think I said

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:16,310
the arch wiki because it is pretty good

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,080
yeah often when I'm on posh Debian and

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,940
answering questions then it comes up

00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,380
with the best answers of the time but

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,370
hey I'm rubbish you're writing

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,370
documentation so

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:31,440
another effort we've come up is deed

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:34,020
apps ability to automatically have debug

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,640
symbols something which few other

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,900
distributions ever have had for a while

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,690
and it's really really good to see that

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:44,810
that this sort of effort is happening as

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,810
well if Nils is around well done

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:56,520
not the only one that so what's next

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,170
what's the next things that that Debian

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,860
can do where can we go from here and

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,720
what sort of ideas can we have there's a

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,270
whole range of things we can do but I'm

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,490
just going to pick up two or three that

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:14,520
want to kind of concentrate on and see

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:18,300
where we're going first ppas it's near

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:22,050
enough the package that'll do me so I've

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,940
got a broth scheduled on Friday I do try

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,440
and look what we're doing with with this

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,270
and trying to finish off it was in my

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,550
platform was something I want to push

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,170
into something I believe that will

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:35,490
really help the development of Debian

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:38,760
now it's slightly different from a

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:41,090
bunting PPSS they're well known it's not

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,450
going to be somewhere that you can just

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:47,130
dump random software and people install

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:51,240
various quality packages this is going

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:56,340
to be a very useful tool to aid Debian

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:58,500
development itself so as far as I

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,140
remember most of the work is actually

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,590
done now huge thanks to the the FTP

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,120
masters and and DSA etc for this so so

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,730
the actual code is there in fact the

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,940
only missing bits are the control

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:14,430
functions so how you create new ppas

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,350
and the one abililty system and how we

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,240
saw basically build stuff and and touch

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,940
releases so it is going to hopefully

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,100
come any minute now and something that

00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,790
we're we hopefully we'll be able to use

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,080
and will ease the sometimes the pain of

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,540
when we freeze

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,700
sometimes the ability to easily create

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,740
back ports or even to ease library

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,730
transitions if you can create a PPA

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,680
where

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,060
you staged your library check everything

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,040
works and you can fix all your breakages

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:48,630
then it that should help unstable and

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:52,620
testing as well one on outreach I guess

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,720
is near enough so it's kind of

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,699
interesting

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,190
I've always mentioned that Debian is in

00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:05,480
a huge position to touch many people's

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:08,910
lives and it was slightly worrying that

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,740
the compared with the amount of Jessie

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,130
release parties we had all over the

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,430
world

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:17,930
I figure called one into one in India

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:21,269
for example and he was globally popular

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:24,420
but all of our Sprint's have been in

00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:27,000
Europe so we haven't had some in North

00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,519
America we haven't had any in South

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,829
America and there's huge areas here we

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,279
can really try and push and bring free

00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:38,760
software and really help push Debian to

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,110
to be the go-to place in these various

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,050
countries rather than keeping it a

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:47,610
Europe or sometimes even North American

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:50,190
market and Debian's in a great place

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,699
because we are a community distribution

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,730
we we try and aim to be the universal

00:13:53,699 --> 00:14:00,329
operating system someone that anyone can

00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:03,440
come along join help out in whatever way

00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:06,510
they they want to be it packaging or

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,190
doing wonderful press work for example

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:16,319
not mentioning that press work at all

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:17,730
she's not even looking at me she's going

00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,470
through what she's going to volunteer to

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:26,220
do more press work in future again it

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:27,630
says so so it's an area that people can

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,760
get involved in really easily and

00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,160
because we're distributed because we

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,170
work online it is natural that people

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,730
can come and join us and we should

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,839
encourage that and we should try and

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:43,920
reach out and try and reach more people

00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:48,640
third area final one here is around

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:53,500
accessibility it's kind of a sad

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:56,290
fact that free software is about 10

00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:00,940
years behind proprietary and commercial

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:03,700
offerings there's a reason that iPhones

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:06,310
are hugely popular with people who need

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:09,460
accessibility options they are just

00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:14,230
fantastic compared with what you can get

00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:16,440
normally I don't believe that it's right

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,570
that people should have to use

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,690
proprietary software which they pay for

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:27,160
to access computing and to access the

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:29,740
web and to be able to explore what what

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,590
we all have we should be able to be put

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,840
in effort so there's certainly an area

00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:37,450
which we can really make a difference to

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:41,170
people and try and drive forward to

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:44,170
bring computing to everyone rather than

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:47,230
just those who are fortunate enough to

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,940
be able to see a screen well or be rich

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:52,540
enough to be able to pay for a license

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:55,900
or buy a computer or a system for from

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,970
from a proprietary company there is no

00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:02,170
reason why we shouldn't be able to do

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:04,210
this we were able to speak and work

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,030
directly with people who require

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:09,160
accessibility features and let those

00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,760
people help design it in a way that is

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:15,070
much easier than any proprietary company

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:20,770
so it's an area that I think we can try

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:24,490
and solve help push quite a bit and so

00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:30,670
finally just a bit of a huge thank you

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:33,510
from me really it was about to UM have

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:36,970
been involved with Debian since about

00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:39,940
2001 or so and doing loads of different

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,950
roles so originally doing the web apps

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,960
policy which never really got beyond

00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,360
draft because web apps are terrible

00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,450
terrible things that don't really work

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,710
with distributions that well but then

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,500
with Joey has doing testing security

00:16:53,710 --> 00:17:00,130
team and certain of that eventually that

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,790
led into many many years of release

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,790
management

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:10,159
and then many years of being released

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:13,399
manager as well and then after that I

00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:16,010
was and then I told him I found be at

00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:17,600
dead conf in Banja Luka and found out I

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,209
could write a press release and then

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,139
roped me into doing bits there but after

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:26,630
that I was sort of feeling a bit I know

00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:29,000
too burnt out I didn't really know what

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,419
else to do with the project and I I

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,649
think this offer happens to everyone and

00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:38,929
it's a huge reminder each time of when I

00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:43,730
come to Deb calm and I meet people and

00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:46,279
how fortunate I am and we all are to be

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,620
involved with such a fantastic project

00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:50,210
something that really is changing

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:56,389
people's lives something that is

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:58,760
breaking the traditional proprietary

00:17:56,389 --> 00:18:01,580
market and enabling people have to have

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,440
greater access to computing and it's so

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,899
really fortunate that that I'm in a

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:12,080
position to to help lead this project

00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:15,799
and to do everything for you finally I

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,389
think I mentioned I think Phil hands if

00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:21,260
he's probably not around is he around

00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:22,880
probably a small child trying to throw

00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:27,950
up on him for anyone who saw the morning

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,919
announcements today he did kind of joke

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:33,710
that the next deep hill hustings then he

00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,200
can just write a autoresponder bot - to

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,850
any questions which is that sounds

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,409
interesting I look forward to seeing the

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:44,840
results so so sorry

00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:46,399
general I think it's something that we

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,470
should be able to try things so if

00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,010
anyone hasn't any ideas stuff they want

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:55,000
to do Debian has the money let's go and

00:18:52,010 --> 00:19:00,380
try some stuff if we want to sprint to

00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,909
to work on accessibility in in today in

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,380
Hong Kong because there because there's

00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:06,200
a huge issue there or to improve our

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:09,470
localization then let's do that we have

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,419
the money to do it we have hopefully you

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,080
can certainly the interest around so

00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:14,080
let's go and try things

00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:20,600
as a promise I thought I'd keep it nice

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:24,950
and short so as everyone seemed to be

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:27,350
getting hungry so I guess so Conley

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,780
leave a bit about a Q&A or for anyone

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,820
any questions or want you to put me on

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,100
the spot about anything or some random

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:37,070
thoughts anyone had then there are

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:42,730
certainly be very happy to to answer any

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:45,020
of those or someone has to be first

00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:54,190
otherwise my timings really really out

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:54,190
oh good

00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,660
[Applause]

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:04,850
lucky me

00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,910
hello what's your name and where are you

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,910
from

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,620
yeah go on

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:27,200
what is your single highest / highest

00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,470
yeah preference what is your highest

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:37,460
priority thing that you think we should

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:39,480
all be working on getting the next

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,950
stable release album

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,140
to be honest but this is what we do as a

00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,690
distribution we release things we make

00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,600
software we give it to our users Debian

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:53,460
is famed for its stability we backport

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,250
our security fixes people can rely on

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,580
Debian they can trust us to produce a

00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:03,900
rock-solid distribution something that

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:05,490
people can in some cases yes derive

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,030
works from if they don't like what we're

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:11,040
doing they can tweak it there was the

00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,990
huge thing that came up when dev Wong

00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,670
came up for saying oh we're going to

00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,700
fork Debian and it's going to be

00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:19,890
terrible it's like fine there's over 100

00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,290
new 20 Forks of Debian out there already

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,450
that's falling please come and do this

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,910
we're happy with that being able to

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,520
produce this reliable stable operating

00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:32,100
system that we only release when we're

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,210
ready which happens to parently be about

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,590
every two years now is something that

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,110
everyone relies on a suite to be able to

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:43,500
do and they can trust us to produce that

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:46,320
for them so essentially putting out

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,450
releases is one of the main reasons

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,700
we're here to get that software into the

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,410
hands of users there's loads of other

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,700
stuff of course which we can do to try

00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:57,050
and improve and push forward free

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,760
software in general but we are

00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:02,670
essentially a distribution our aim is to

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,290
collect software and then distribute it

00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:16,580
and one of the best way to do those

00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:16,580
releases good good go on

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,620
what's your favorite thing about Debian

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:41,590
for those that didn't hear that I'm not

00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:45,360
allowed to say releases I'm apparently

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:51,250
not to say the kilt as well because it's

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:54,130
an unfree beer yeah it has to be the

00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:58,000
people that I'm involved with I mean if

00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:00,250
it the the project has enabled me to

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,370
meet so many awesome people and

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,650
basically have the career I've had so

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,420
far as well if it hasn't there has

00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,440
always been a thing about being involved

00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:13,810
visibly with an open-source project that

00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,720
not only that helps you professionally

00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,940
as well so I got my first job because I

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,160
was involved with free software I then

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,980
got my next job because I was a Debian

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:27,460
developer and could put together Linux

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,950
systems easily and knew how to manage

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,810
these various crazy different projects

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:35,430
which were written in hundred different

00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:37,030
libraries using different

00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,400
compatibilities together to make

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:42,460
something home and then my current job I

00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,370
got because essentially I was involved

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:49,000
in doing management II type functions in

00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:53,530
Debian and it's a it's a say to people

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,780
when they ask how can you where's the

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,430
money in fries in free software how how

00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,190
can I create a career with it it's

00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:02,140
basically it's very easy get stuck in go

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,050
and do something find something

00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,300
interesting that interests you and that

00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:10,930
you were able to be the world expert at

00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:14,890
and you can do that and on an entirely

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:16,690
personal view I some of my closest

00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,330
friends are with Debian people I've

00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:22,510
worked with for many many years

00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:25,060
and I certainly wouldn't have moved to

00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:27,250
my current city or know half the people

00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,060
I do if it wasn't for that it is the

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:32,110
Debian family is a large one that

00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,030
occasionally gets together at Deb

00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:37,270
from Christmas and sometimes has huge

00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:39,070
blow up arguments prosper over the

00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:43,809
turkey or the init system something like

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,130
that but but we do all come together so

00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:49,210
I mean we have huge contentious

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:51,880
decisions but we're still here so we've

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:55,030
had huge arguments with everyone trying

00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,340
to stab each other at the end of the day

00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,679
but we're still here we're still the

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,299
Debian project and sort of like that

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,429
it's something we love to be associated

00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:08,340
with and it's everyone around that that

00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:16,810
really makes that thank you

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:30,980
[Applause]

00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:33,200
anyone else no I'll just stop it right

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,760
back ups are really really important so

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,180
we should definitely concentrate on

00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,180
backups

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:58,190
I think something we need to be cautious

00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:03,430
of not necessarily a risk and something

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,430
I think will harm Debian is a

00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:13,010
essentially a return to to the past so

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:19,550
you have now the containers docker

00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:21,530
ization etc are we teaching people that

00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:24,320
it's okay to go to a random web page and

00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,660
download your app from there and then

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,610
install it are you going to get any

00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,440
security updates for that is that going

00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:34,840
to be integrated how are you going to

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:39,140
work with that along with that comes a

00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:43,390
risk that we return to non free web

00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,920
services so in the olden days you had

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:49,490
the guru who was in charge of the

00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,590
mainframe and only certain users if they

00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,300
were very lucky could access it through

00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:56,510
their special terminals that they were

00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:59,840
allowed to do now you have the gurus of

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:02,900
the web service and you can only access

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,360
it through your mobile phone restricted

00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,720
that you can only talk to it how they

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:13,430
want to the use of free software and

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,590
making sure we're able to control what

00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:18,560
we do with our computing is something

00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:21,470
that has been the fundamental driving

00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,590
force behind what we all do and very

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:26,880
tenants of free software and I think

00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:30,600
there's that risk as especially

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,390
now as free software is becoming more

00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,540
mainstream that people realize oh

00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:40,950
there's some stuff over here great we

00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:44,280
can use that but perhaps not being as

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:47,490
educated as people involved before about

00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:51,210
the fundamentals on your rights and how

00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:54,860
you can use it this is a huge

00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:58,530
opportunity as well for for Debian to

00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:01,020
help Shepherd that that changing to make

00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:03,180
sure we are able to restrict it but I do

00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,220
think that there is a risk there that

00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,220
unless with village unless we're

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:12,210
vigilant and we make sure that we keep

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:16,040
those hard-earned rights then then we're

00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:21,000
going to return to it to a an era which

00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:25,680
we are essentially just just the

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,980
consumer we don't have any control thank

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:33,210
you

00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:35,130
another question from the side so so for

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,500
Devin else although we are all free and

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:41,160
open and we are pushing frontiers but so

00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,080
far we are playing largely by industry

00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,900
rules right let's say we have our

00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,210
trademark policy so nobody could use

00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:51,060
Debian word in their products which to

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:54,150
protect how our presentation out there

00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:57,090
right that's what current policy states

00:28:54,150 --> 00:29:01,290
today have heard about already so many

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:03,360
derivatives H Linux I saw all those FSF

00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:05,490
acknowledged distributions which are

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,300
also many of them are based on Debian I

00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:12,360
think it would have only benefit us if

00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:14,760
any of those were Debian HP or some

00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,280
other name which has definite visibility

00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,850
that means a lot right so actually if we

00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,650
were more open and more kind of

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:25,470
accessible to those derivatives right in

00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,570
time in just in terms of using our name

00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,850
we would have been in better place

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,310
because more people would have known

00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,020
about David that's why I wonder where

00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,960
else could we push our openness

00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:40,250
frontiers to get away from what kind of

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,010
industry culture

00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:45,620
sturdiness and maybe it would be for our

00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:48,050
benefit what do you think about it so in

00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:50,030
terms of the track well in terms of the

00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:53,390
trade market it was always kind of

00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:56,930
interesting to me that originally we had

00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:59,810
a logo that was non free and we had a

00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:02,000
special use logo only for developers

00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:04,190
that no one knew what it was and if you

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,660
put it somewhere no one will know what

00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,970
this little bottle is because everyone

00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,880
uses the open one in terms of our

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:14,440
trademark people can use it just need to

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:19,520
ask and we give license grants is around

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:22,220
there is a baath tomorrow at 11:00 and

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,730
then another one at 3:00 as well around

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:30,190
trademarks and how we deal with it

00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:34,340
I'm I'd be keen to have for example

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,450
Debian from HP as a brand there's

00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,470
nothing wrong with that it's obviously

00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,290
it's not

00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,420
Debian it's not official Debian but it's

00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:44,840
obvious that it's based it's based on us

00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:46,970
and where it's coming from the use of

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,590
the word deputies is descriptive and it

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,960
should be quite clear I'm fairly happy

00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:53,540
for people who want to do that just

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,000
email trademark teaming and we can set

00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,950
that up but I certainly recommend anyone

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,280
who's kind of interested in where that

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,660
trade off lies is to come along at 11:00

00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,540
tomorrow I think the title of the talk

00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,700
is something around what we can call

00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:11,420
official Debian or Debian or Debian

00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:16,160
derived or based on Debian as well but

00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:21,500
yeah I mean it makes sense right so we

00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:24,980
have instead of so for example instead

00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,730
of H Linux if we had a different policy

00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,480
it could have been

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:34,010
Debian from HP or Debian for Debian for

00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:36,610
HP for the machine Edition also the guy

00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:40,040
we can do something like that and that

00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:42,770
emphasizes I think how much Debian is

00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:46,040
used everywhere and and the basis of it

00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:49,610
basically being Debian everywhere but

00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:51,679
with some tweaks and that's fine exactly

00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,200
my point is just now it's not happening

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,360
because explicitly policies they

00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,880
it shouldn't be unless you contact us

00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,220
it's all those you know what is allowed

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,330
by default or even if we stated that

00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,950
okay just you know use our name right

00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:18,140
well but okay tomorrow 11 yeah got it

00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:20,540
tomorrow 11 it's just easy we could

00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,840
disagree visit late McClure I personally

00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,550
do part we can I say we missing the laws

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,920
shouldn't trust don't follow it don't

00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,870
have a trademark one point I disagree

00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,340
with doing that or say well yes we need

00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:34,070
to follow the rules because we can't

00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:37,940
make local laws we could make a good ol

00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:41,120
boys nursing fit with it so it's kind of

00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:45,350
interesting here if we have a look at

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,440
some of these overreaches in trademark

00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:52,150
or overreaches in copyright or patents

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:56,020
that we've had that's hugely damaging

00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:59,540
but as we've seen recently on

00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:02,720
SourceForge with things being

00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,670
distributed with extra add-ons or things

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,820
without permission then we can have

00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:12,350
problems there by not choosing that I

00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:14,480
mean I'm fairly confident that there is

00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,670
certainly some people in Debian who

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,430
think that copyright should just be

00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:23,870
abolished and and everything should be

00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:25,580
free but then you don't get copy left so

00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,910
so so where do we draw the line we as

00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:31,910
free software advocates we rely on

00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:34,190
strong copyright law to be able to

00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,840
protect our user freedoms rather than

00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,270
rather than locking it up so there is

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,310
that that line there you have to try and

00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:42,590
use more I think success especially as

00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:45,260
Bradley was saying all the tools we can

00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:47,540
to try and help and and push forward our

00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,790
use of freedoms rather than saying just

00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,160
because we don't particularly like some

00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:53,600
uses of this law doesn't mean that we

00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,030
can't find a way to use it to our

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,220
advantage and and basically turn it

00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,140
around turning on its head and like

00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,120
we've done with the GPL I'm like we've

00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,580
done with free software to really drive

00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,300
things forward and an upset industry in

00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:09,450
in that way that

00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,920
that that this protectionist system that

00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:17,429
was put in place was never designed to

00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:20,310
do I think there's a lot of folks going

00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:24,000
on in the free software world anyway and

00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:27,230
it's rather uncommon that the name is

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,290
taken over regardless of trademark law

00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:34,350
so I don't really think the name would

00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:39,230
be taking over with all the forks if we

00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:42,390
didn't have to trademark on TV on yeah

00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:46,350
until in terms of forks but when you

00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:49,170
have a when you have a project that

00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:52,200
wants to recognize that it's basically

00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:55,310
Debian we should make it fairly easy for

00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:59,190
them to them to be able to do so so a

00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:00,900
slightly tweaked version or a debian

00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,600
blend or something like that we should

00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,460
be able to allow the Debian marque to be

00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,330
used to describe where it has come from

00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,520
and if it's 99.9% Debian then we'd say a

00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,180
new kernel or a backported package here

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,500
there and everywhere

00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:18,720
then I mean if you you saw basically

00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,240
hold it up to the light and go yes that

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,050
looks exactly like Debian to me it's not

00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,360
that much of a problem I don't think for

00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:30,480
us to be able to say for people to just

00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:34,920
use the word Debian to describe what it

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,480
actually is because it's Debian of

00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,240
course folks if they completely change

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,160
everything then that's different but

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,200
that's why we can review this and and

00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,420
one of the reasons we we wanted to do

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,340
this licensing this this permission

00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,780
based thing so if something does go

00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,880
horribly wrong and it does completely

00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,940
change we can just not renew the

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,250
permission a lot of these derived

00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:00,050
distributions write it on the website

00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,050
quite clearly already so

00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:09,540
I think the only downside has been the

00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,280
amount of people running mint or a bun -

00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:16,980
coming to the hash Debbie an IRC channel

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:23,370
link I owe this PPA doesn't worry I've

00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:24,800
talked to them about that but cool any

00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:28,260
more questions

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:36,540
as a handy hint it's now dinner time to

00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:38,550
be down so since I've already been asked

00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,860
the question once this year I figure

00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:42,660
it's only fair to ask you yes it's a

00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,640
little early to be thinking about this

00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:56,190
perhaps but are you gonna run for

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:58,710
re-election when I decided to stand

00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:02,850
I saw a taking view it's like do I think

00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:06,780
I can do a good job for the project and

00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:08,190
I can provide value for the project and

00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,680
I think the answer was yes and

00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,420
apparently quite a few people agreed and

00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,650
then I found myself waking up with this

00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:19,250
slightly terrifying job kind of

00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:22,620
interestingly a lot of the DPL job is

00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:26,400
talking to other organizations like free

00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:28,950
software foundation SFL CSS FC the gnome

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,960
advisory board you've run that you and

00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:33,990
this you'd get contact from lots of

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:39,540
people and I said in a couple of the

00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:43,920
interviews I did is that again in a in a

00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:45,510
years well in six or so months time I'm

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,480
going to have a look again say do I

00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:50,460
still think I can do a really good job

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,750
for the project and is there anyone else

00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,810
who I think is going to do a better job

00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:57,390
for the project if there is then they

00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,910
can do it if I do think I can do that

00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:02,610
then I'll stand again i if there's

00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:05,340
things I think I can I can help provide

00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:07,440
and help push for then then yes but I'm

00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,790
certainly don't have any yes I'm going

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,700
to do this for this year and this for

00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:13,830
this year I I'm just happy to try and

00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,859
see if I can be you that this is a this

00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:18,170
is the latest way I think I could I can

00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:19,609
Debbi and then help the project as I

00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,009
haven't actually packaged anything in

00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:25,549
about four years or something like that

00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:28,910
no no package something yesterday

00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:36,650
yesterday and it got rejected from you

00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:38,299
twice and it was only like a simple back

00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,619
port as well I'd probably drop the

00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:41,769
version numbers wrong and then the sweet

00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:48,730
wrong so so I don't do that anymore

00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:48,730
bad idea anyone else

00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:55,759
everyone's getting hungry right well

00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:58,670
thanks very much everyone thanks coming

00:38:55,759 --> 00:39:01,430
out hopefully it's been mildly amusing

00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,150
or something at least so go get some

00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:11,800
food thanks very much

00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:11,800
[Applause]
