https://debconf15.debconf.org/

The talk shows how to install Debian on a set of machines (a computer lab, a school, or your neighborhood!) more or less automatically.  

We start with a so called "InstallBox", a machine that provides a package cache and PXE boot installer images (di-netboot-assistant, squid).

The installation may be customized using preseeding techniques. We start with minor modifications and end up deploying  a DebianLAN network.

the next talk will be about up install

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:20,100
your neighborhood and it will be held by

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:25,350
andreas Monde enjoy okay thank you good

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:29,220
morning from I fight after Mattox nice

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,040
talk about a frame of the emerging

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,309
countries all over the world I want to

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,300
take you now next to your home to your

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,700
neighborhood your neighborhood is now

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,379
sitting in the new queue waiting for FTP

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,480
mat of masters approval no just kidding

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:52,559
but maybe your neighborhood is sitting

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:57,449
in a pub in a local pub like it is every

00:00:52,559 --> 00:01:00,780
two weeks in my village I live and we

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:04,110
started some new Linux meeting there

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,780
some workshop helpdesk so you can go

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,610
there everybody's invited to drop by

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:14,100
help get help just to chat and of course

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,159
you bring can bring your laptop or

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,360
computer and have it installed learn how

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,689
to install there be and how to use it so

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,280
in the beginning this is simple

00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:28,950
everybody knows this I don't think I

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,659
have to spend much time on it you

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,710
fetched installer media you run the

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,729
installation you put the system and

00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,790
usually you have to do some manual

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:43,470
configuration user has some preferences

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,810
and so on we started then with a kind of

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,220
special event so-called we called it

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,810
install party and we make these posters

00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:55,680
all over the village more or less and

00:01:51,810 --> 00:02:00,930
made some advertising and invited

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:08,009
everybody on a Saturday afternoon to do

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:10,259
this in a bit of a bigger scale and the

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,060
question was how are we going to do that

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:17,349
running around with CDs with USB

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,660
six and so on seems to make travels so

00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:21,400
we've thought about a better idea how is

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,330
this done in enterprises it's done with

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,780
a proxy technologies with a netboot

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,060
installer and we thought about setting

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:36,099
up such some such a small box and we

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:40,510
called it install box what does it look

00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:44,830
like a friend of mine found this nice in

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:47,080
trusty oh great PC in his in the

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,350
basement of his company and the nice

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,569
thing is it has two network interfaces

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:57,670
and you can install Debian on it and

00:02:52,569 --> 00:03:02,980
that was our hardware we try to put that

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:04,810
install mechanism on of course it's not

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,019
needed to have this hardware you can do

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:11,890
the same with a virtual machine on every

00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:14,620
laptop slightly more complicated because

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,690
usually you don't have to even that

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:22,030
interfaces past you can use but you can

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:25,000
use the VLAN interface and it works the

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:28,299
same in the end more or less okay what

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,180
does this install box need I already

00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:33,940
said the hardware it's desirable to have

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,130
these two network interface cards and

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:41,019
you need about 10 gigabyte of disk space

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:45,579
and then we need to configure the

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:52,350
network we need a we want to connect to

00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:57,810
the taps network usually you get DHCP

00:03:52,350 --> 00:04:01,359
network the not dynamic address from the

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:04,630
from the outside more or less and then

00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:07,380
we have our internal network where we

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:13,000
are going to set up our own addressing

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:18,489
then we use peak reboot net install and

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,250
we want to install 64-bit and sometimes

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:24,659
people show up with really old laptops

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,520
old hardware so we will also need some

00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:32,350
38 bit installer

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:37,450
and services really need to set up DHCP

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:39,850
ever set DNS a trivial FTP service and

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:44,800
package cache something we also want

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:51,100
because the bandwidth is are limited so

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:55,140
I will now quickly go through how this

00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:58,270
can be set up i'm wrote this down

00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,340
extensively to really copy and paste it

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:05,250
and set up this machine for your own but

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,250
i now will only quickly rush over it

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:16,360
okay first you start with a standard

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:20,530
chassis installation may be at an ssh

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,650
server to login on to the machine and in

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:26,500
the beginning you have automated after

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,620
the installation one network slot will

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:33,419
be already configured to use DHCP we

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:36,370
will use that for the outer network and

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:40,510
well first step is always the good idea

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,250
install if you see keeper to make sure

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,970
you don't lose anything when you're

00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:48,150
doing all this then we add the second we

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:55,210
configure the second interface for our

00:05:48,150 --> 00:06:00,970
static at this static configuration and

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:04,169
we install DNS mask it's a simple for

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:07,690
this simple use case it's a nice thing

00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:10,060
we don't need to configure much we just

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:13,470
have to tell it in first step what the

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:17,380
DHCP range is we want to supply two

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:20,229
machines in the local area network so

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,169
then where do we get the net boot images

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:26,020
from there is a package which is called

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:30,010
the inet boot assistant and you just

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:34,090
install this package create a TFTP boot

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:36,010
directory and then you can with these

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:40,520
two commands the i net put a system

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:44,960
install chassis and the same with arch i

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:50,300
six 386 you can make these netboot

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:57,500
images ready and we just have to look

00:06:50,300 --> 00:07:01,069
how to - we just have to tell our DNS

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:08,630
mask to surf these images at the right

00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:11,569
time so we put a path in there in the

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:17,139
DNS mask configuration enable the TFTP

00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:24,020
server and well tell him where to find

00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:28,880
exe binary and we then start restart the

00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:32,199
service and if we check what we need and

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:37,819
what we already have we will find that

00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:40,729
DHCP IP address works with DNS

00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:43,970
resolution pH the Installer boot works

00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:46,690
but we don't have web access yet and we

00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,490
don't have a package Castle cache so far

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:53,750
okay how to do that there are different

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:58,120
ways I did it with Shaw wall because I

00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:02,479
used it in another setup it's a firewall

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,570
front-end I would say what do we have to

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:10,840
do there just install Shaw well switch

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:13,669
it on we want I P forwarding and then we

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,740
just use the two interface example

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:20,120
configuration we just have to copy it in

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:26,780
the to the configuration and modify it

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:33,529
slightly we want the local net to access

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:36,349
also these install box and we want from

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:41,419
from everywhere we want to be able to

00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:44,510
log in via SSH just to simplify

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:48,230
maintenance so after that we will have

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:50,470
also web assess but no package cache so

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,470
far

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:59,160
so we installed squid and this is now

00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:02,590
some more modifications are needed to

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:07,860
make sure that the packages are cut are

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:11,380
cached I won't go into details there but

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:15,420
after we've done that it's by the way

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:21,580
taken from a package sweet Depok see

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:24,460
this configuration we have set up the

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,740
package cases cash as well now we want

00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:30,010
to make one other modification we want

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:35,910
to have a transparent cache we don't

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:38,320
want to configure the the proxy on the

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,570
under computers that are going to be

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,270
installed because then the people go

00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:46,750
home and this proxy isn't is not there

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:50,740
anymore and it doesn't work as expected

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:54,520
so we want that all traffic is going to

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:57,250
the outside is to port 80 is going to be

00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:02,340
redirected to our package cache and this

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,340
is done with these few lines of

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:10,150
configuration and then we can check that

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,400
in the XS lock and we see after having

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:16,990
downloaded a package it's cached and

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:21,850
it's just resolved from the cache if

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:24,370
it's required again ok so far we're done

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,490
all our all the stuff we wanted to

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:33,220
implement it's working

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:40,060
and we can pick the boot a client we get

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:43,510
this ugly menu I would say we can then

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:49,050
choose an installer forget the usual

00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:51,340
Debian installer menu and this is

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,490
slightly improved system where we have

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:58,690
some monitoring for the sweet proxy you

00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:01,270
see the green fields are all hits of the

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,600
cache or of the memory and only very

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:07,980
little packages or

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:15,760
the package lifts or something which is

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:18,490
it's downloaded from from from the

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,899
internet but most of the stuff is from

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:25,149
the cache ok so far this is the simple

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:29,080
setup and now we want to improve it even

00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:32,350
more and I want to show a technique

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,890
which is well known for many years but

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:37,450
it's quite can be quite confusing or

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:40,149
it's not easy to use it's very powerful

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:44,860
but also a bit complex and I just want

00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:48,520
to show what we did in our case what is

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,350
proceeding well proceeding means when

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,620
you do the installation you're asked a

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:56,200
lot of question questions and proceeding

00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:03,279
means that you answer the questions in

00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:07,630
advance so how is it done you need to

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:12,579
prepare a pre configuration file there

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:16,529
is an example provided by on the link

00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:19,180
below you need to make it available

00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:23,620
there are several ways how you can do

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:26,079
that HTTP FTP and even some more and you

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:30,100
have to tell the Installer where and how

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,820
to fetch this image this this proceeding

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:38,500
file ok how are we going to do that we

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:40,750
use the TFTP server of the DNS mask so

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:46,320
we don't need to install anything else

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:49,930
we just create a location there in the

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:56,050
TFTP server root and put there our in

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:59,230
our proceed configuration and some

00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:03,190
cosmetics we want to resolve the install

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:06,970
box with the name install box so we put

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:09,930
the name into the EGC hosts that's where

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:13,200
the nest masks looks for

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:18,900
in the first in the first attempt looks

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:25,230
for names to to resolve names okay then

00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:27,060
the proceed file we use that one I have

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,210
to say we we don't want to do anything

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:33,900
automatically we want also to some kind

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:35,580
of educate the people to show them that

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,910
it's not complicated to do an

00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,350
installation and so that they at home

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:44,040
can do an installation on their own but

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:46,790
we set a few things which we think for

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,290
our case are quite useful so we don't

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:53,730
want the root account we switch that off

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:58,500
look the question usually unfortunately

00:13:53,730 --> 00:14:00,750
we need some non-free firmware so we

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:07,580
switch that on you choose a mirror which

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:15,150
is next to the village and we use KDE

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:17,430
because we think that's kind of what

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:22,100
people expect or what they are used to

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:26,940
when they come from the windows world a

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:29,760
few extra packages at block plus it's

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:36,450
useful and as I said some firmware and

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:38,970
we switch on time service ok how do we

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:44,190
tell the Installer to use that file we

00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:48,510
have to add some node in the in the boot

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:52,410
good line and with this setup I show

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:55,320
here it's as simple as URL equals TFTP

00:14:52,410 --> 00:15:00,420
double points double points left slash

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:07,380
in box so when we now install if that

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:10,050
boot line we find in the block lines

00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,990
like proceed successfully loaded proceed

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,590
file and then you know anything works as

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,490
it should

00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:22,210
can also grab if you if you miss that

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:24,790
at the moment where this line is created

00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:26,620
you can also use scrap receipt Morlock

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,630
syslog and then you also end up with

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:33,040
this line so this is a nice check

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:36,970
because if you try try it here and there

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:41,200
and sometimes takes a bit until it works

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:55,270
as you think it should ok a few further

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:57,220
notes you can specify these pre

00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:01,150
configuration files also by the by the

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:05,170
DHCP server you can also answer

00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:09,010
questions already within the boot

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:11,740
parameters you can set at the back

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:17,500
parameter which is useful when you try

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:21,040
this default values can be modified as

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:26,380
well and there is a boot parameter

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:29,410
automatic install which helps when you

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:33,750
want to proceed questions that are asked

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:36,610
even before the network is set up so it

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:40,410
it shifts the configuration of the

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:46,150
network network to an early stage so

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:51,160
that remote in the extreme all questions

00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:53,050
can be answered by proceeding ok if you

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:59,290
want to do in completely automatic

00:16:53,050 --> 00:17:04,990
installation you need to answer all

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:08,080
questions asked and you can put a extra

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:13,900
line to the net boot the inet boot

00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:18,660
assistant menu I showed it's shown here

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:23,410
in the middle you add Auto equals true

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:26,470
priority critical and you tell again the

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:29,680
location where it finds the proceed file

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:31,720
and then you rebuilt the menu and after

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,990
that you have an another entry here in

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,879
the

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:40,269
in the boot menu which just pooted after

00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:44,049
a timeout and then this entry is booted

00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:47,950
and installation goes through and the

00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:54,940
machine is ready okay there are some

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:56,440
limitations we see this proceeding in my

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,539
opinion is fine for more or less

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,129
standard installations you can do really

00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:05,139
you can do in the end you can do

00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:13,119
anything but it's a question of how how

00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:14,559
to handle a complexity and it's it's

00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,659
kind of fragile

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:21,429
sometimes things are changed and you

00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:24,029
have limited logging logging

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:27,279
capabilities it's all there but it's

00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:31,749
sometimes tedious to figure it out and

00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:34,840
to find what you need and it also takes

00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:38,559
a lot of time to dry again and try again

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:44,740
until you succeed so if you want to do

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:46,840
more complex things then usually you

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:54,159
would probably use something like puppet

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:56,919
chef and Sybil cfengine or five two

00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:59,259
years ago I gave a talk about the Debian

00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:03,519
line which tries to solve this problem

00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:10,090
it's a small project inside a beam which

00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:14,259
has the goal to set up a local area

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:16,779
network within Debian as simple as

00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:20,830
possible and if you're interested in

00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:22,659
that I recommend to go back and watch

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,049
the video

00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:28,749
slides are also online I will skip this

00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:33,159
now completely but I left slides in here

00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:35,740
a kind of refurbished slides just to if

00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:39,330
you may look this up later

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:43,629
you have the complete line but now I

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:45,100
switch to the summary and conclusions I

00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:47,740
hope hope

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:52,780
gave you an idea how to set such an eye

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:55,510
install box how to configure DNS mask di

00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:59,410
netboot assistant or wall and squid with

00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:03,429
a few lines of configuration I hope I

00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:05,620
could give you an idea about how to use

00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:09,850
proceeding to get rid of boring

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:13,030
questions and as I said for more complex

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:18,250
installations take a look at find Debian

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:20,140
and here are some links where you can

00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,380
find further information more

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:26,590
information I think the experts about

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:30,130
proceeding our the auditorium as well

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:33,340
sitting here in the front so if you have

00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:35,470
really special questions maybe I can't

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:40,049
answer them but we will find someone who

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:44,220
can and I want to say thank you and

00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:44,220
maybe there are some questions

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:53,579
[Applause]

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:09,809
the non-technical question about the

00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:13,770
publicity and telling in a pub that you

00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:15,720
are doing the install party could you

00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:18,090
tell me tell us more about this how

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,240
advanced some tricks what you learned

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:26,190
do's and don'ts what he did dog

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:28,559
technical stuff you mean how we how we

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:32,370
did a bit more about install party and

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:36,270
telling it to people outside of the

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:41,460
usual technical area how did you get in

00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:46,140
contact with okay I think this is very

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:50,059
much depends on where you live so I am I

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:54,720
ended up in a small village which which

00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:59,190
don't doesn't have any really much geeks

00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:03,920
but I found a few neighbors which are

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:07,080
interested and I we started to do some

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,800
using Debian and they got interested and

00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:15,480
there is a this puppet does a lot of

00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:19,590
MIT's Larry open to cultural things and

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:22,160
it you can there are concerts from time

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:25,440
to time and it's really they have a

00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:31,710
repair workshop once in a month where I

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:35,309
can bring old old kitchen gear and they

00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:38,100
try to repair it and so on and there we

00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:39,570
started with this idea and we asked the

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,690
guy from the pub if he would be

00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:45,770
interested to serve as a location for

00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:48,059
such a venue and he was interested and

00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:54,210
that's how we get started and then we

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:56,730
created this this did this advertising

00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:59,670
and asked friends and neighbors and so

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:03,600
on and it's really in a small scale and

00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:06,059
it's probably different from how you

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,390
would do it in in a larger town because

00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:13,410
it's more anonymous in this in this in

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:14,460
this town but the other one I've shown

00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:21,150
you

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:23,130
oops oops oops can I do it the other one

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:28,110
was on in a small on a small conference

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:31,770
in it was called two peaks near two

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:40,680
Bingham maybe I can show you that and we

00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:44,550
just recycled this this panel so it was

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,860
a we offered it it as a along that

00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:50,340
conference it was one day's conference

00:23:46,860 --> 00:24:00,180
and we offered that to do installations

00:23:50,340 --> 00:24:09,260
and we prepared that one any more

00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:11,880
questions yep so one question about

00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,540
security I mean when you're on a local

00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,340
network like this there might not be

00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:21,660
malicious intent but you if you are in a

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:23,430
more office environment or in a

00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,490
virtualization environment maybe there

00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:29,820
are someone trying to intercept your

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:33,150
initial boot it's ternary protection

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:35,790
against this like signing or providing a

00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,890
hash of the proceed file or something

00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:42,240
like this could you talk some about

00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:48,360
security aspects at the moment there are

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:50,910
no security no no methods against these

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,190
attacks implemented at all so this is

00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:55,860
really for a small scale where where you

00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:58,670
more or less know the people or you you

00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:02,850
you can look what they are doing and

00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:06,060
these are people that you are happy when

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:14,690
they try something else than their

00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:17,550
windows and it's not the kind of geeky

00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,680
hacker hacker space as we have it here

00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:23,250
so it's really something completely

00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:26,070
different so I think the the the

00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,520
probability that someone tries to hack

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:40,040
the system

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:42,020
it's raveloe okay

00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:46,420
I'm around for the whole week so if

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:47,750
someone wants to know more or has

00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:53,680
questions

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:53,680
whatever just contact

00:25:54,390 --> 00:26:02,559
