The talk shows how to install Debian on a set of machines (a computer lab, a school, or your neighborhood!) more or less automatically.  

We start with a so called "InstallBox", a machine that provides a package cache and PXE boot installer images (di-netboot-assistant, squid).

The installation may be customized using preseeding techniques. We start with minor modifications and end up deploying  a DebianLAN network.
