The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol is widely used by Internet-connected hosts, including Debian systems. It is most commonly associated with the "hostname to address" lookup service needed by many Internet protocols, but it has an extensible design and is capable of distributing many types of information.

The DNS has a highly componentized architecture and no individual package in Debian is responsible for implementing DNS support as a whole. This talk will introduce the DNS architecture and explain how individual packages in the Debian archive together implement this architecture.

Other topics covered will include:

 - The DNS data model.

 - The broad history of the protocol, and likely future developments.

 - How the DNS is commonly deployed on the Internet.

 - How Debian's DNS support compares to other operating systems like Fedora and FreeBSD.

 - Privacy, security, and governance considerations.
