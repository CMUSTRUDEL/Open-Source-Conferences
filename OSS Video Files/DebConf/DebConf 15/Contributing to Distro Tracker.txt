so thank you very for attending and

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,840
please welcome Kristoff we will talk

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,860
about how to contribute to this to

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:19,800
tracker so Kristoff it's up to you thank

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:23,250
you thank you hello so today we are

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,869
going to speak about this tracker and

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,519
also about how to contribute to it and

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:33,690
maybe it gives a little feedback about

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:37,739
how I experienced it and it can help in

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:44,430
order other projects too so that's the

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:47,430
menu we'll go through it so the main

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,530
thing is practically if you want to help

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,160
in the snow tracker we have a

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:57,510
documentation which is well written and

00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:00,870
here is a little summary of it's in

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,449
Debian we like to use emails and use the

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:08,340
back tracking system so every new

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:10,920
feature or problems is listed there it

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,770
can be intimidating to to email and

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:19,590
publicly when you have questions but

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:22,950
that's the way we are we use to there is

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,549
a absolute package called tracker Debbie

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,200
underdog which you can use so tracker is

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,090
not a package yet it's not packaged in

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,810
midian but they still absurd a pocket

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:39,509
you can use to refer to it in the BTS we

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,689
have a list of of tasks suitable for

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,700
newcomers the new newcomer tag is

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,920
something new it appeared last year I

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,570
think it's the IDS to to let new people

00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,840
get in Debian and have some mentorship

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,869
from people who are more experienced so

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,540
it's it's a great way to to start

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:05,030
volunteering for for packages or for

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:08,450
projects and to learn to interact with

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,450
with each others

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,260
of course you can install this so

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,800
tracker locally hack on its and share

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:26,620
what you did it is maintained by the

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,360
Quality Assurance team so we have a nice

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:32,140
each channel and a meaning list feel

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,380
free to join and please use it and give

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:40,090
give us with feedback so currently it's

00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:42,480
not the the package tracking by default

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:49,180
it's not the official package tracking

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:55,540
but maybe it will soon be maybe this

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:59,069
still a little more work many around the

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:03,510
mail system it it could be stronger so

00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:08,380
we're waiting to fix that before before

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:12,880
pushing it so what is this drawer

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:16,769
tracker it's a it's a tool that gives

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,690
you a lot of information on packages

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:24,670
well you can get this information with

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:28,600
other tools like dpkg or our Madison or

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,790
I don't know but imagine you you're an

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,930
advanced user and you you need a

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:37,630
software that mo you need a recent via

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,540
version of a software you can go on

00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,609
tracker and look for that software you

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,680
will see that unstable has such a

00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:48,480
version and testing has another one and

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:53,500
also you can notice the differences and

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:57,250
and yeah I like to think of of the

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,870
webpage of tracker it's kind of a single

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,019
point of contact with all the

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,720
informations and all the other tools are

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,599
links there so it can be used for by

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,709
contributors advanced users teams and up

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:17,709
streams to know what's happening about

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:19,870
when one package you can track several

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,289
package that's that could be used by

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,289
teams

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,950
so the two main interfaces are at the

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,380
web interface and also this mental

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:38,290
system that's quite powerful you can

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:43,560
subscribe to it and and get the same

00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:47,490
emails as maintained errs do or just

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,990
just a set of it you can just opt for

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,600
specific emails about I don't

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:59,830
translation derivatives bugs or what you

00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:03,700
care about so let's talk about the

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:08,890
design it's really better than the old

00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:10,990
pts which is good it's yet better

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,350
this one has testing driven development

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:17,790
so we we try to write the test first

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:22,540
watch them fail and and then fix them

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:25,420
check the code I mean it uses Django

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:29,650
which advertises itself as fast secure

00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:32,740
and reliable so it's really something

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:41,500
that helps to to build tools open up on

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:43,630
it and yeah yeah we just we trust to

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:49,060
that using a such a framework gives us

00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:54,370
structure and and the possibility to to

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:56,410
code well so we developed a few

00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,750
different modules Django modules they

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,730
are called applications but it's those

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:05,080
are just fightin the Python applique

00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:07,690
modules there's one about the user

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,020
management which could be used by other

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:13,900
projects it's interesting because it

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,730
combines one user can can have several

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:21,270
email addresses and it's often the case

00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,270
with Debian collaborate collaborators

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:29,290
the project is well documented in the

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:32,169
code and outside it can be used by

00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:34,960
derivatives currently it's only used by

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:40,020
it it's already used by Kali

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,729
and yeah maybe the idea is that all the

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:47,470
derivatives could use the same tool to

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:50,830
manage the day packet and the distro so

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:57,880
if you maintain if you're part of the

00:06:50,830 --> 00:07:01,330
derivative try it in comparison with the

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,180
previous PDS this one is dynamic the

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:09,880
previous one computed the data a few

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:12,370
times a day and it has user in instances

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,729
so you can customize it for your own

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:21,570
needs for the moment it doesn't go very

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:27,760
far but we can imagine to have much more

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:28,389
specific customization what are people

00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,840
involved

00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,870
it's the Quality Assurance team and the

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,539
project was started by Rafael I think

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:45,820
who was also one of the author of the

00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:50,110
previous PDS and there were two

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:55,000
mentorship programs to try to have

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:56,830
people contributing to the project I was

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,169
part of the second one it's called a new

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:04,000
contributor game it was organized by the

00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:07,030
Debian France France and initially there

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,320
was also a Summer of codes and McCole

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:16,599
that it did the initial work and yet

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,800
those programs are in my opinion really

00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:23,050
a great way to to learn to interact in

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,580
Debian and who to learn to program and a

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,930
lot of other things because you have a

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,960
good relation with somebody who's

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,279
already in in Debian and who understands

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:39,219
all the

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:41,289
so if you have the opportunity to to do

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:48,940
such such programs or to use the the

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:51,880
newcomer tags you should there have been

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:55,930
17 people contributing to to this show

00:08:51,880 --> 00:09:01,240
tracker until now the project has

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:04,389
started two years ago in 2013 and the

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:08,829
previous PDS have I think it's in 2001

00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:12,399
and those are the people who did one or

00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:17,709
more commits and you are welcome to join

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:26,019
of course some thoughts about

00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:29,320
volunteering so Debian is about

00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:35,050
packaging free software with a lot of

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:37,899
other tasks of course mice if I talk

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,720
about my experience I'm Jang with

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:43,600
developers so that was a really good

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,399
opportunity for me to contribute to

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,550
Debian because that's something I really

00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:52,600
wanted to I also tried to maintain a few

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:55,630
package but I feel what what I can help

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,160
the best is such projects there there

00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:01,240
are a lot of other projects using Django

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:04,329
in the gun to submit for instance we

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,260
have own instance of samhita I heard the

00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:10,930
looking for Django developers and Rico

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:16,060
has several django projects he needs

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:19,300
help and also if you know HTML or CSS

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:23,740
and all the web things there's a strong

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:27,579
need in various Debian projects you can

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:30,639
watch this address it's a census of all

00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:35,319
the all the services Debian has on the

00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:38,949
web and basically they all would be

00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:42,990
happy to have some help in in the HTML

00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:42,990
design and those kind of things

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:53,990
why should you do it because it's fun

00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:58,860
because it's an opportunity to learn in

00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:01,639
Debian we value communities so we tend

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:05,069
to work in teams there's a list of teams

00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:09,930
please read it if you haven't done yet

00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:13,410
and that's it

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:16,259
I was quite faster than I thought but we

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,350
have a lot of time for questions thank

00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,350
you

00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:50,959
so it's not really a question but I want

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,940
to sunk a crystal or I think I made

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,160
Steve talk because actually I was

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,889
supposed to do it Paul Wight asked me

00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,720
and I said her not another joke let's

00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:04,100
try to bring some new blood and

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:06,259
Christopher Lee said he joined us during

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,439
a game so it's not so long ago and he's

00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:11,600
doing really a great job on the digit

00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:18,649
rocker there are not many people helping

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:22,839
us or us most of the code but in Britain

00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:27,079
by Mark College is curing to made

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,449
swimmer of cod at that time he said he

00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,759
wanted to continue to contribute in the

00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:35,560
you would help us but after the more

00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:38,779
disappeared and I'm basically

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,750
maintaining meat alone with some time

00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:43,069
commits from polarize and Christoph and

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:47,480
a few people but I would really like

00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:50,240
more help and I took the time to tag the

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,029
back nutriments that he said so I will

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,889
review all your patch quite quickly so

00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,769
you'll be if you want to help you can be

00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:00,920
sure that you will be you will have

00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:04,490
quick feedback and it will be quickly

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,490
deployed because if the test passes I

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,050
just install it

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:14,689
I took a check that you have written

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:18,350
test first but otherwise I deployed so

00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:23,019
if you have a few questions we can ask I

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,019
would have expected a few question but

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,880
did you measure how many people use the

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,010
new tracker no you do some kind of

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,260
survey or something because person I use

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:46,080
the old one I have no idea why

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:50,010
precisely because basically the same

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:53,730
functionality but that would be

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:56,250
interesting maybe to see when you take

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,830
me as a sample it's 100% the other one

00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:01,860
so maybe you could do some kind of

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:04,170
survey it's more like good idea a lot of

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,660
people told me they they tried and they

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,450
even some of them are using the new one

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:12,930
but actually the other links are

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:15,150
pointing to the to the current one so

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:17,760
they they'll be one moment we're going

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:21,920
to do the switch we not so far from it

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,920
but let's do it properly okay

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,930
this I we have no statistics I didn't

00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,450
bother looking at it but it's clear

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:46,320
that's all one is going to disappear at

00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:50,120
some point the UN is doing pretty well

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,340
well it's dead at pace pace so sometimes

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,770
when the database is restarted for

00:14:53,340 --> 00:15:00,000
security reasons it won't go out for a

00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:07,050
few minutes but otherwise it's really

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,920
really reliable mainly I don't trust

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:15,420
fully the male parts because during the

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:20,090
Summer of Code we had some problems due

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:22,370
to the way agzam folks hundreds of

00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:25,290
processes when he gets hundreds of

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:29,910
commitments in the same second and it

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:33,030
tends to cut several down so I just want

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:38,520
we just want to add a make you in the

00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:41,970
front the processing I always think that

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:45,720
I will be able to do it next month but I

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,060
mean that's like for two years I don't

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:54,630
give you any date if you do it the

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:59,670
sooner there's a link on the old tracker

00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:02,340
pointing to the new one and I guess more

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,970
people are using the new one no but I

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,970
can't be sure

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,610
that

00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:23,749
excuse me they're still working so what

00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:27,079
does it need to become the default

00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:31,999
tracking system as as Raphael says I

00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:35,299
think the main part is it wouldn't

00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:38,239
handle the load that's how I understand

00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:43,549
it for now it needs some parts of the of

00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:46,160
the mail handling should be better the

00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:49,549
web part is efficient but what's really

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,829
interested not true it's efficient

00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:54,730
enough for this what a load we have but

00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:54,730
it's not efficient

00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:04,370
so yeah mostly the the mid parts needs

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:06,740
to to be correct corrected and yeah

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:11,149
I haven't looked different into it so

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:16,339
maybe Raphael can say more about it well

00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:17,799
I just explained its it does work many

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:22,279
people are using it

00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:25,429
we did not some acting configuration to

00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:29,120
avoid the problem on most cases but it's

00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:31,960
really soaking up we can use it only the

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,940
load of the machine so basically it will

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,730
run under the processes bringing the

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:41,990
machine really slow but then you stop

00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:44,210
processing and it will wait a bit so it

00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:48,950
doesn't kill the Machine anymore it's

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:51,200
not nice you know in my opinion other

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:55,970
people can community the other way but I

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:58,279
have not felt any urgency to switch I'd

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,610
rather finish and fix this correctly

00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,610
first

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,840
