Debian used to have a reputation of having a rather harsh community, where flamewars were the normal way of handling conflict.

Over the past decade or so, however, things have gradually improved to the point where this is no longer the case. In recent years, we've had two general resolutions in this area: the diversity statement in 2012, and the code of conduct in 2014. Together, they are the Debian community's instruments in ensuring that our project remains a welcoming environment.

Are these instruments working? Do we need more of these? Or are we perhaps overreaching in our effort to keep discussion civil, to a point where these instruments are counterproductive?

Let's talk about that.
