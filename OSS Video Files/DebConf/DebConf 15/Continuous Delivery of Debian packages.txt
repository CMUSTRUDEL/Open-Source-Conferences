How would it be to just commit your packaging changes to the version control system and get automated Q/A tests plus Debian packages for different releases without any further manual work required?

This is what we're doing for a company who relies 100% on Debian packages. The OpenStack project jenkins-job-builder allows us to manage more than 800 Jenkins jobs through a few YAML configuration files  without touching the Jenkins web interface. jenkins-debian-glue takes care of Debian package builds, building on cowbuilder, lintian, piuparts and autopkgtest. Code review using Gerrit as well as configuration management (Puppet + Ansible) helps us control the workflow and infrastructure.

All the involved software is open source and in this talk I'll provide an overview how such a system can look like, how you might benefit for your own project and which challenges you might face.
