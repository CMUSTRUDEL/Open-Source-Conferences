After an exciting and incredibly well-attended BoF at DebConf 17 in Montréal, interesting developments regarding mobile devices continued (in no particular order and without any attempt of being complete or fair):

1. The Pyra, while still not released (as of 2018-02-07), nears completion of hardware and casing.
1. Purism announced their plans for the Librem 5, a Debian based smartphone. Their crowdfunding campaign was amazingly successful.
1. Another recent crowdfunding reached their financial goal in only one day: The plan to create a free Linux driver for the Allwinner VPU, started by Bootlin.
1. ZeroPhone has constant progress on both hardware and software side,

as well as many other projects.

Let us look, where we are one year later. Which ideas took off - more or less, which did not?

	00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:31,579
okay

00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:34,220
most happen we need to know readiness

00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:39,019
and seen Vicki I would suggest making a

00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:42,140
copy yeah above a copy whatever you like

00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:45,559
I do not care as long as somebody takes

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:51,980
a notes you can take we I or whatever

00:00:45,559 --> 00:01:07,100
you want a smoke XMPP you like who's

00:00:51,980 --> 00:01:14,750
volunteering yeah and somebody who's in

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:19,310
I see and Trust works whether there is

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:24,320
anyone who likes to command or has a

00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:28,910
question to the audience can we just

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,890
copy the latest Obito ality no it's

00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,320
about taking risk is knowledge there

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:38,020
some of these non-biased year and and

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,020
wants to trust something so somebody

00:01:48,170 --> 00:02:00,210
yeah okay okay thank you um okay we have

00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:04,560
a mobile above Nastya and Mohan which

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:11,160
was amazingly visited by the people and

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:17,280
with very very discussion and it turned

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:20,849
out that as far as I can can say there

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:26,180
are three directions people think about

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:30,989
Debian on mobile devices and all of them

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:38,099
advantages disadvantages there is one

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:41,549
direction mainly using hardware that

00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,750
works well as data so for example open

00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:46,500
hardware or hardware

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:50,299
it's not too much lockdown that is like

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:55,170
the libram five we will see later more

00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:57,630
or the pyrrha and handheld or the GPD

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,700
pocket which you see right now with a

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:05,400
visitor running on the three key big

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:07,739
pocket the slide this which is also a

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,139
kind of mobile device and so on so this

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,269
is how we are either made for use with

00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:17,190
this free operating systems or at least

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:20,790
not lockdown this advantage clearance of

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:26,099
this is of course those devices are very

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:29,340
few and they are expensive so yeah we

00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:32,010
are excluding most people in the trust

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:36,780
is a price tag then there is the idea of

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,350
putting carryin on normal mobile devices

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,700
on Android

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:44,700
devices with millions off but it's

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,900
technically hard because they lock down

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:53,820
and I my personal opinion is it gets

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,740
worse every year so but if we would

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,950
succeed with that that would be also

00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:01,860
very nice most of the time it wouldn't

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:06,420
work at all or you have to stay with all

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:11,580
come and the idea that came up last year

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:15,330
was to enhance the scope of Debian to

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:19,500
make a kind of Damian Android not

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:22,020
android new linux android non new and

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,730
novel no Damian on the new Android why I

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:32,160
don't know also very nice idea but also

00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:37,070
has drawbacks like we would have to

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:42,210
follow one single company policy because

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:44,250
otherwise you would go away from from

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,820
the mainstream Android I can't and it

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,220
wouldn't make sense anymore so these are

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,850
the three directions as far as I know

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,640
the only thing that improved since last

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:59,120
year was the first one with special

00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,120
devices

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:09,060
[Music]

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:12,150
comments that that nobody really what

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:16,400
further was a debian work on Android

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,720
devices that was also a remark about

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,820
gemiini

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:29,039
it really does not run that young in a

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:31,169
meaningful way so that is what I would

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,360
like to start with and maybe we can

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:37,770
already start with your slides if you

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:42,960
like it's a presentation about the

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:45,199
progress of tourism so what did you guys

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:52,349
learn from the Oakland open mocha

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:56,729
experience any lessons learned last year

00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:59,580
I think most people did not want to talk

00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:08,010
too much about it because so many hard

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:10,169
feelings but yeah let's not there are

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,990
many different opinions about this I

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:17,360
can't really repeated all the some

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,360
things but like it was much too early

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:27,960
there was a lot of politics going on

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:31,889
there was also the Nokia disaster and 7

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,669
to 911 and so on so maybe somebody else

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,669
could command

00:06:38,470 --> 00:07:14,830
I am maybe we should cut some onion the

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:19,630
cryptocurrency new I asked the owner 100

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:22,960
cars about this before mentioned one of

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,790
them is working on the second Toyota and

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,480
the other two people are affected by

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,480
health issues

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,610
now yeah

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:54,660
by the way this light shower running on

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:58,440
this small machine which practically is

00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:04,770
also mobilize it's a PC it's called GPE

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:08,520
comment it's a normal PC Andy 64 gig of

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:14,160
ram so it's going dannion on it is quite

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:17,040
easy so danyoung installation is

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,100
relatively easy on this one no arm stuff

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,420
and so on so we have already some mobile

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,420
devices now running them

00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,169
[Applause]

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:53,970
excuse me do you have any documentation

00:08:50,930 --> 00:09:02,360
for answering Debian on the GPT because

00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:02,360
I have you in - okay I didn't see

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:09,770
because there is many patch on the

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,770
counter here and so on okay thank you

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,140
on screen keyboard obviously new

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,140
function based

00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:05,029
Rochelle that should not how many you

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,029
need

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,020
and the old days

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,030
Oh

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,970
they said they're wrong

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:58,769
you're asking for so long what's not for

00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:04,110
us is to build that wrong images

00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:06,689
that is what's left me to move packages

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:10,819
built but the important

00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:15,290
yeah which is infrastructure for ers

00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:20,160
it's written by my discipline crease

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:22,290
exit and yeah the right emoji format I'm

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,579
just or imagine startled by Sony's

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,579
complete transition to pure eyes

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:46,640
Austin you were policy that's very

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:48,380
important otherwise safari dependency

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,430
prevalence support and we Britain

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:55,209
marshal of strains other words real

00:11:52,430 --> 00:12:04,750
rules it written by the guy who is

00:11:55,209 --> 00:12:07,820
swayed by three environment the OS he

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,529
averages with airports was a traditional

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:14,620
Jersey to be out streams on my progress

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:14,620
something will be done recently with us

00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:22,079
we can't simply be monkey boy but a

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,579
proper dignity workers and also for

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,579
custom layouts

00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:26,579
I

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,330
[Music]

00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:00,700
[Music]

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,199
because

00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:16,350
Vicki's once laughing investigate any

00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,250
comment for this accretion news

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:22,770
Hollister advise the Liberty to unload

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,070
decryption but its release is probably

00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,070
when I started

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:39,370
you will see for them or further up a

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,700
little more who would imagine some of

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:58,270
the fear of loss therefore think our

00:16:41,700 --> 00:17:22,290
most recent one is not serial so this is

00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:22,290
going to be by our hands which changes

00:17:38,960 --> 00:18:43,950
yes well ringtones call history

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:46,510
generation very powerful so I was which

00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:50,170
was to go with

00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:52,390
for the browser which is easier because

00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,820
it's less cold and we would have our

00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:58,930
simulations or the doing changes

00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,280
sporting and I think proton suffice

00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:05,070
Firefox and they're not really

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,070
interested more than four actually works

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,710
so far using this changes and it burned

00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,920
up seemed to improve is a beautiful

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:20,760
small screens initially and in we go

00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,760
have anymore

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:40,820
images contact calls him carry on team

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:44,870
decided to go with fury as a provider

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:46,820
for the release date I think that most

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:51,400
outstanding issue for the here is that

00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,400
it currently doesn't have GDG support

00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:06,680
more settings so something that was at

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,110
quality and chance to actually talk to

00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:13,400
the 14 most if not all the whole thing

00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:17,350
was their first an ability to set up

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,350
sync our headset it's our car

00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,329
[Music]

00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:11,470
an electrician in fact reverse logic was

00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:21,560
investigate to come up with a plan for

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:23,840
recruitment messages so far Yossi will

00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,460
photo by hand so a lot of course as well

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:30,820
as assessment and resources

00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:40,180
I must let finalize them before applying

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:55,390
any issues why you tell them nobody

00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:58,320
knows really it's another part of the

00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,320
four things are done

00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:06,370
as far as I understand the purple is

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:08,440
basically if you ever used a pigeon it

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,630
is the lip purple is the back is the

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,720
back end of is the back end library of

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:17,530
pigeon and the purple actually is

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,300
Nepal's SMS messages and sometimes if I

00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,750
remember correctly even some put a phone

00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,140
calls

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,140
actually

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:47,620
Yuri very mobile friendly the image

00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:49,630
again Yuri's evidence of our nothing was

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,580
that investigate cheesy but ours was

00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,770
nice we made mobile friendly would be

00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:57,039
materially their camera company the

00:22:53,770 --> 00:23:02,280
thing is this is fine I open the font in

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:11,230
that it will be either really adopted

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:14,100
different cameras long calendar that's a

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,100
part of the image

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:29,030
visually require the images so I guess

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:29,030
what's interesting so silly name list

00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:44,940
matrix chance community liberal mind is

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:48,390
the main point where you want when you

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:52,590
want to discuss 14 the 14 community ers

00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:58,910
is where I am and emergencies and other

00:23:52,590 --> 00:24:09,000
voters community curious curious is

00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:13,380
tourism why to make services that angle

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,980
Paris is to actually have integrated

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,230
unified socials for social networking

00:24:16,980 --> 00:25:10,370
such as

00:24:18,230 --> 00:25:14,299
muscle dawn yes for one question one

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:15,470
question why do you build create a new

00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:17,720
build system

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:21,049
what what was that you could not use

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,960
existing ones or what drove you to

00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:29,290
create this you know called Lana Kia

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,290
maybe developers here he can

00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,979
[Music]

00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:56,159
so so Laniakea is not a bill system it's

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,500
more something like Launchpad where you

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,789
can which managers the are the packages

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,580
that are coming into the archive we're

00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:04,110
just able to distribute jobs to workers

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,090
to build images when there are new

00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,340
packages that are relevant or and to do

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:10,080
all kinds of these things and to like

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,940
kick off transitions in case there is a

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,240
transition going on or something else is

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,889
detected and to communicate with with

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,169
our seed channels and to have some kind

00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:21,299
of integrated database which holds all

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:23,159
the information on the system like going

00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:25,889
into detail what's actually be out of

00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,200
scope for this session but we can talk

00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:31,139
about it later of it but in general it's

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,149
very much comparable to something like

00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:35,399
launchpad that once users but without

00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:36,929
the backtracking and without the project

00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:41,870
management approach that is also a

00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:41,870
launchpad and yeah that's basically it

00:26:47,670 --> 00:27:05,270
I don't have so much and I would try to

00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:05,270
look for other OS its since last year

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:13,770
aye-aye

00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:17,540
lastly I had a prototype with me this

00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,540
time I asked a developers again

00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:54,060
elvira the gaming console practically

00:27:50,670 --> 00:28:00,320
it's an arm-based meaningful future with

00:27:54,060 --> 00:28:02,280
four USB ports to satsang and it comes

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:08,010
comes with that gun

00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:13,710
by default my my personal hope is that

00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:18,920
they will release the first 500 devices

00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:27,450
later this year I'm in the same patch

00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:29,880
for my waiting number 500 also has it

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:33,390
have screen so I'm pretty sure that

00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,030
they're Karen that UI software were

00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:41,680
drawn very bad on it

00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:41,680
[Music]

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:51,140
wait for the software bad person to make

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:54,610
it very well and also i found a little

00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:58,550
bit the zero farm because I had my bro

00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:04,640
that's not so much and he evolved a

00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:29,570
little bit with hardware new USB port is

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:31,990
not only for charging base going 0 for

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,990
yes

00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:50,710
it's they don't have a case right now

00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:53,980
and it has a very small display 6p by I

00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:56,950
don't know what pixel or whatever for me

00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:04,080
with my age it's already unreadable so I

00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:04,080
probably will never really use it with

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:12,059
Wi-Fi and something

00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:23,080
Raspberry Pi zero based downtown style

00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,990
it's a smart phone in consequence the

00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:30,360
notes perfect downfall because it says

00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,360
only black and white small this great

00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:43,940
it's all no graphical interface

00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,940
[Applause]

00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,010
[Applause]

00:31:40,770 --> 00:32:25,419
very common project

00:31:44,230 --> 00:32:27,929
they also serve and and favorite drivers

00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:27,929
for something

00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:48,320
Olivia breezes the library Android

00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,320
devices

00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:05,500
um so Hallie ohm is actually still very

00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:07,330
much alive even closest okay so Harlem

00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,760
is still going on it's basically a

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,320
combination of different lower level a

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,840
different middleware pieces that were

00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,180
just packaged together with as far as I

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,140
know in the Boonta base and I think it's

00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:21,910
very much maintained by by the KDE

00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,950
people still and by some other

00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,050
stakeholders but I don't have any deep

00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:31,030
insight into it I think post-market OS

00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:35,430
is also maybe using it but yeah I think

00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:35,430
it still is still alive so

00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:49,109
but also could be interesting at some

00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:54,599
point is running Android apps so I know

00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:54,599
any communities there's traffic running

00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:10,440
there's also

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:23,169
my IBM for the phone usage but

00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:23,169
heuristics actually pushing the ambos

00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,130
yeah

00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:55,129
it's about four rats on our progress

00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:05,309
already a lot I asked year and we didn't

00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:10,010
know about five because of the public

00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:10,010
after that was a really nice surprise

00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:34,190
did you start yeah okay

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:50,430
a phone let us not run and watch

00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:50,430
everybody a very small market

00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,279
you still might be

00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,620
as a mother

00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:46,109
oh yeah

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:59,059
I think one of the really interesting

00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:02,750
projects that's come out in the past

00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:05,329
years the post market is they're

00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:07,880
basically an alpine linux derivative and

00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:12,289
they're working on mainlining a whole

00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:15,440
bunch of Android devices and yeah

00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:17,420
they're trying to basically be what

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,420
Debian could have been if we'd focused

00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,460
on that sort of thing and so I think

00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:27,250
it's worth looking at what they're doing

00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:27,250
if you're not familiar with it already

00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:47,109
thank you sir I have a question about

00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:55,480
the purism libra m5 hardware how bad is

00:37:47,109 --> 00:38:04,509
the firmware blob situation oh yeah

00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:06,220
we're down to one leg now I'm not very

00:38:04,509 --> 00:38:08,529
precise on this part because not for the

00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,450
team but I think they have like the

00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:11,920
modem basement something blob is gonna

00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:15,630
be needed but they're actually

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:19,690
separating it from like the main CPU and

00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:21,970
there was a blog post about from Bob ham

00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:26,430
I think about it so you can check into

00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:26,430
details more on the person blog

00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,910
Thanks I just realized it's not Debbie I

00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,700
bet anybody's mention replicant yeah

00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:46,150
which is the free version of Android and

00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:48,250
as the non free drivers removed and just

00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,480
a quick update on that is that they're

00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,940
having they could really use some help

00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,050
because there's a number of there's one

00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,250
great severe bug that's been open for

00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:57,520
quite a while that prevents a lot of SIM

00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,960
cards from being recognized and another

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,320
issue is that with the deprecation of

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,470
the 3G network basically none of the

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,690
supported devices will work within a

00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,100
pretty short period of time because no

00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,570
current no currently supported devices

00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,570
have 4G or LTE

00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:28,859
okay officially we are out of time but

00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:32,160
we can probably have some minutes more

00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:36,710
one thing we said last year if I

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:40,470
remember correctly we wanted to user

00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:44,640
user attack and the backtracking system

00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:46,920
for mobile related backs remember we

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,609
talked about that and I I think I end up

00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:54,479
two backs also with attack if I remember

00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:59,460
correctly but I did not even check

00:39:54,479 --> 00:40:01,349
whether that went on or something I need

00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:08,430
to recheck and I forgot about it until

00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:12,170
now I I think we we agreed on having

00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:17,999
that so that one can easily find mobile

00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:22,200
related box in our BTS from that can be

00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:25,410
from kernel to user interface issues now

00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:29,369
with this small PC here I find a lot of

00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:31,890
issues with you eyes that are pretty

00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:34,769
horrible on the small screen especially

00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:38,690
nowadays where a lot of small screens

00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:41,910
have high resolution so that's a really

00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:46,710
bad thing for for most of classical

00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:50,279
device and of course and mobile we have

00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:52,559
to think about both directions both a

00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:55,559
small displaced with a low resolution

00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:58,349
and also with a high resolution and of

00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:01,769
course it should work in any case and

00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:07,289
currently I believe most UI's work in no

00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:11,579
case so probably we need to file a lot

00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:13,200
of box against applications it also

00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:15,150
would be worthwhile to mention the

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,509
osmocon project which is a project

00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:21,359
that's actually doing at least trying to

00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:23,219
do a lot of implementations making code

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,920
for what's needed for like mobile

00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:27,920
communication like GSM and other things

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:44,370
yeah we are focusing here completely on

00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:48,090
on devices yeah is also there was some

00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:51,900
work to bring Debian on eBook readers

00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:55,590
but I'm I read something about it but I

00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:58,560
forgot details that are mobile devices

00:41:55,590 --> 00:42:03,600
too even if they have no mobile network

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:09,750
or something but if there's anybody here

00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:13,860
who knows more about it no ok is there

00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:19,110
anything we a stabbing show to mass to

00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:21,240
where we can work as a project on mobile

00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:25,020
we have the mailing list everybody knows

00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,890
that we have the is eternal everybody

00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:33,780
knows that

00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:37,650
Debian mobile yeah that's it do we have

00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:44,670
any relationship about about iOS

00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:46,470
jailbreak projects of stuff no ok just

00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:52,020
interesting fact because they are so

00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:54,860
they are also used in DB catchy I always

00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,860
a CDR

00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:14,410
okay then that's it for this year and

00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:17,260
let's look about the probe an exterior

00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:22,990
we'll all have a labrum five in our

00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:28,450
pocket right the para will be out even

00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:31,870
before so our our pockets will be

00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:35,790
completely out we're behind by different

00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,790
devices thank you

00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:43,439
