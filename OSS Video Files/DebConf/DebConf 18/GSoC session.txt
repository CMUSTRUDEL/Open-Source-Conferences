thank you I think it does so right how

00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,850
many of you ever about google Summer of

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,960
Code already if you're not aware I could

00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:21,490
be introducing more about what is it and

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,990
and then talk more about but we are

00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:27,730
going to do in this session so can you

00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:37,420
erase the hand if you are all already

00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:38,829
aware about Google okay thank you I

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,289
think most of you are aware it's

00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,969
bringing the student developers to the

00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:47,079
open source community it's all about

00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:49,449
that so this the session is going to be

00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,489
mostly the students introducing their

00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:53,559
projects and getting the feedback and

00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:55,480
this is discussing with their mentors if

00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,629
they are getting any questions from IRC

00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,699
we could discuss how they can improve

00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:05,290
with their project on their own ongoing

00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:05,860
projects okay so let me introduce about

00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,960
myself

00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:14,140
I'm Germany so I come from Sri Lanka I'm

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,009
one of the coordinator for google Summer

00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,840
of Code with Debian so Debian has been

00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:23,860
participating in google Summer of Code

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,490
from 2005 and it's been 13 years it has

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:30,100
been participating and we had a break in

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:34,210
2017 and now we are back again in 2018

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:37,270
with google Summer of Code and these are

00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:40,320
the team for ji-suk coordination I am

00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:45,579
representing the team Daniel Paco

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,719
Alexander and it's me this year we have

00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:52,360
last excepted 20 to 25 students and

00:01:48,719 --> 00:02:00,640
that's the link for the projects that

00:01:52,360 --> 00:02:01,630
are ongoing this year so there is an

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,840
interesting

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:07,539
ji-suk statistic this year this year we

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,090
have selected I mean this was from the

00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:13,090
Google open-source Bloggie block and

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:17,560
they said there are three students

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,400
accepted from Kosova and the three

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,200
students

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,930
from our Debian community and they are

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,019
here joining us joining with us to

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,209
introduce more about their project I

00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:30,519
hope that without wasting more time I

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,500
could give the chance for the students

00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:58,049
to introduce to talk more about their

00:02:32,500 --> 00:03:02,650
projects Arthur can you yeah nice

00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:04,629
so hello my name is our to the response

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,700
team I'm going to talk about my g-shock

00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:08,379
project that's title improve it is to

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,720
tracker to better support Devon teams

00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:13,379
my mentor is Lucas kind of Shiro and my

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,269
commenter is half our head soggy him

00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:19,299
provide you some context about why we

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:21,700
are doing this so basically damage teams

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,500
use it to rely on package interpret

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,190
racket which is a system that basically

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,790
gets some from Asia but the package from

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:33,730
diadem from Ali off and displays some

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:39,489
kind of information inside tables in

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:41,889
some categories and we also had inside

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:43,629
our dive infrastructure the tracker that

00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,810
by org that you probably have used it

00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:48,129
before that basically get the same kind

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,000
of information from several sources

00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:55,359
inside Debian and put this in a debit or

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,579
in a web application so for example have

00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:59,470
the page of a specific package Robbie

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,530
this post and you can get all the

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,290
information related to that package and

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:08,650
what we want to do because that has not

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,349
been be maintaining it more and also he

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:14,319
used it to track the package of posters

00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,120
from Elif and what what you really want

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,889
to do is choose continue to support them

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,109
and change to track the health of the

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:22,840
Packers and to prioritize they work

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:25,449
efforts by migrating the best features

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,810
jujitsu tracker and also you want to

00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:31,630
track such a post or instead of a LOF so

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,999
what are the results we have so far so

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,879
with

00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:36,799
if you enter in a gym page of engine

00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,199
inside you so tracker we are going to

00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:41,299
get this kind of table so basically have

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,849
the first column with the package name

00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:46,249
the second column with the change log of

00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:48,039
version in the VCS of that package the

00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:50,689
third column with the archived version

00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:54,110
we also are tracking the bugs here and

00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:57,169
the last column has the upstream version

00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:00,679
okay of this package and another

00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:03,379
interesting feature that we're providing

00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:05,839
here is that if you pass our mouse over

00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:07,610
one of that field we are going to get

00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,069
more detailed information about that

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:13,419
specific field okay so for example here

00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:16,669
we have the information links to BTS

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:20,719
related to the bugs of that exists for

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:23,329
that package okay we also have provided

00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:25,249
to also provides some categories so

00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:27,289
basically we could have more than one

00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:30,049
categories of package tables for example

00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:32,869
could have like packaged with RC bugs

00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:35,629
package that has read a new version in

00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:37,639
the upstream and we have a specific page

00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:42,379
to display each of these package tables

00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:44,449
okay and we have a large number of teams

00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:46,909
inside Debian inside the specific

00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:50,539
specifically inside the disso track so

00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:53,269
we also provide this autocomplete text

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:55,189
field so you can easily find your team

00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:59,360
the team that that your you are in

00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:02,679
terrorist team and that was my resource

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,479
and so far we have faced some challenge

00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:08,269
first is that this tow truck has a

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,059
generic Purple's architecture because it

00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:12,829
things should be used by several

00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:14,959
districts so it is also being used by

00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:16,459
Cali community so basically everything

00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,649
you are going to do we have to make it

00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,299
extensible have to design is to be

00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:22,459
extensible by this specific application

00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:26,749
that implements the specific features

00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:28,639
from they register us also the database

00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:30,499
design is challenging because you have

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:36,799
to collect of this view all this data

00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:39,439
from several database table and some of

00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:41,479
this context is sterilizing in G some

00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,300
fields inside the database so it's not

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,330
easy to get this and also we have facing

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,759
some problems

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,259
I see problems because we are hindering

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,000
a large number of table shells

00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,300
dynamically so we are basically building

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,490
each of this table table cells in run

00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:01,770
time okay and unto the end of this talk

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,750
I plan to create a cache mechanism I

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,150
already work on that I propose a magic

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,750
referred it to try to improve the

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:13,469
performance of table hindering I also

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:17,460
want to have all my I'm Marika merge

00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:19,770
request accepted inside salsa we also

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,250
want to provide more package tables with

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:25,770
new categories and also provide a new

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,930
feature that you could be able to sort

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:31,680
the table content based on call us for

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,180
example I want to sort my my my table

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,250
base it on the number of bugs for

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:40,469
example and the results that we got good

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,879
reduce so far and I have the receive

00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:43,770
available feedback from the devil

00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,139
community and I have a lot of ideas to

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,659
continue work on this after digi sock as

00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,129
well the district has been a maze

00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:52,319
experience I have been I learned learned

00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:55,680
a lot with kind of Shira has log and

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,370
other community members I will keep

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,800
contributed to them of course and thank

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,150
you for the double community to provide

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,580
me these opportunity to come here to

00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:08,839
that week off and present my work let's

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,839
get moving on thank you

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:33,539
that she enjoys this Destry fine so just

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:36,000
okay my project is called port carly

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,570
packages to debian and my mentors are

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,849
her file

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,330
rafael Herzog and James Franco Costa

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,409
Magna unfortunately they didn't came to

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:48,420
this year's debconf

00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:50,550
and we are from the pkg the security

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,399
juice packaging team so this is

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:56,279
something that I've been working on for

00:08:53,399 --> 00:09:01,050
the past one year and a half I think I

00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:02,730
started packaging on 2016 and on 2017 I

00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,709
started working on the security tools

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,800
packaging team because this is something

00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:10,410
that really interested me and so what

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,690
actually is Kali Linux Kali Linux is a

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,450
digital forensics and pen testing

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:19,410
distribution it has like lots of package

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:22,140
is the by far the most used distribution

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:25,050
for capture the flag competitions and

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,899
it's based on unstable and the thing is

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,160
that Kali has more relaxed relaxed it

00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,000
policy denebians

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,410
so that's the reason of the the

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,750
differences between the packages I mean

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,060
the package that Kali has and lemon

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,890
hasn't so at first

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,680
I needed to gather some information

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,959
about what Tekken is packages can I work

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,510
out and what are their problems what I

00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,670
need to do in order to get an on main so

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:54,020
I first started using this dashboard

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:56,579
from Kali Linux and they also use pack

00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,399
the tracker system that we use on Debian

00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:02,160
and this is a special dashboard where we

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,589
can see how many packages are on Kali

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,250
Linux there aren't on that moon at the

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:09,930
time and this is from today so there are

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,180
477 packages but this includes

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,940
dependencies and lots of packages are

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,770
not that really important and some of

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,730
them are not installed by the food on

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:22,200
column so the first thing I already knew

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,690
some packages that I really would like

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,510
to see on Devon and the first one was

00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:30,180
Metasploit because it's one of the most

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:33,720
used frameworks for pen testing and I've

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,600
started by looking at what what should I

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,700
do and it was a really tough job because

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,400
Metasploit is currently bundling off

00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,960
their gem dependencies because of this

00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,610
is a huge problem there was a big

00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,670
discussion on the Middle East about that

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:50,160
but whatever I use our apology in order

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:53,070
to see what jesters were already

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,950
tackling this stuff and at the end there

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:58,530
should be about 40 packages that I had

00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,150
to package in order to see if it would

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,070
work because you have the version

00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,220
problem because bundle beans to a

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:08,550
version and we decided not to do that

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:11,430
during this project so I had to look for

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:16,290
other packages and I didn't want to do

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:18,150
this manually so I develop it as a kind

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,230
of Big Show script it shouldn't be on

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,540
shell shape we should be a proper

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:25,500
programming language but he got the work

00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,630
done and this script I gave I inputted a

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,540
list of packages tended clone it all the

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:33,150
Cali get repository for this package

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,400
build each one of them and did some

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:39,090
basics checked checks like if it's at

00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,250
the food cally package if if it's

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,170
beautiful because some of the packages

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,400
are not buildable because we don't have

00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,860
the bill dependencies on diamond right

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,900
now it checks if it's depth 5 compliant

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,690
already if we need main pages if you

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,000
mean it hardening if it if it's burning

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,450
some gems and if there are engineers

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,480
there is about 20 or 30 something

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:03,420
columns on here and so we have you have

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,630
lots of info and in order to know which

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,790
are the most important just Raphael gave

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,430
me the idea to look for the number of

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:15,000
uploads that the package head think

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,920
since it hit at Kali so I just I can

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,960
only I can just only start for the

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,960
number of uploads and I have the most

00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,770
important ones and this made the process

00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:28,260
really easy a lot more easy and I keep

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,790
I'm publishing this on our team wiki

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,120
page and I will keep publishing this

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,440
like forever and you because it really

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,810
helps other people that want to

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:41,790
contribute to work in and this is other

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,560
another software I tried how many time

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,200
do I have

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:49,180
okay another package that I really want

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,460
to see on Debian is the proxy and

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,779
first up Roxxxy I had to do a manual

00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:57,700
checking because it's a Java program and

00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:00,940
Java heads I really don't like Java so

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:04,720
the they bonded like sub proxies a great

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:07,360
software but they bundle some libraries

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,420
and I talked to obscene and they are

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,080
very receptive and they they want to

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:17,110
help us but I didn't manage to package

00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,140
yet I think I would do it after ji-suk

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:22,270
but there are some packages that we need

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,430
to intercept and some of the packages

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,529
the proxy the epoxy up string is

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,720
thinking about dropping then and putting

00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:33,250
just on the extensions because you the

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,170
car doesn't need in and some of the

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,960
packages are old and stuff like that we

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:41,320
have that there's lots of problems that

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:44,260
you can have like there was a package

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,740
which was GPL licenses but it was

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,660
linking against an open SSL and in order

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,720
to do that you have to add a license

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,550
exemption to your license and I talked

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,980
to up stirring it was cow patties

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:02,020
upswing it's a software used to break

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:05,410
Wi-Fi password like doing offline

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:08,170
cracking and up string decided to change

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,089
its license to BSD license so we could

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,160
release that on Debian I can't remember

00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:14,470
right now if you own the new QE or if

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:20,380
already hit it stable but I think it's

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:22,180
on the new queue so in the end the

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,459
results are I make this script which is

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:28,330
going to be used for some time

00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:31,060
there are some fixes that can be can can

00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,980
we we have to do on the script to make

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,480
it better to make the shocking better

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,959
because we still have some corner cases

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,459
where it doesn't work really well we've

00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,500
got some new packages on Debian and

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,390
that's really good we've got I have to

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,330
make some upstream contributions because

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:49,630
for some pack is I wrote their main page

00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:51,640
and I send it through upstream there was

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,470
this the comedy soft software that

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,380
changes its licenses to be like

00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:00,100
correctly compliant with with open SSL

00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:02,570
license and we've got now a better Kali

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,420
and Debian for its users because when

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:08,810
package is just some Cali they don't

00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:11,000
like do hardening that's one example of

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:14,540
things that get better gets better when

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,940
the package is that Debian because when

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,980
we enable hardening sometimes busi

00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:22,160
problems that makes the package truth

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,900
fail tribute and then we fix that upload

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,300
to Diamond and when the package hits

00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,300
unstable carry starts sinking this

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,300
package from Debian and they can use our

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,940
first structure to do some QA and stuff

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,890
like that and and they there are two

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,870
people from Cali that I know it is rough

00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,120
I own Sophie and they work on Debian

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,950
also on our team so when there's a new

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,550
release they they upload their new

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:50,300
release on Debian so that when users win

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:53,390
by that also and they already did lots

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:56,870
of work on their packages so yeah I

00:15:53,390 --> 00:16:01,540
think that's that's that's the dis

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,540
summary of the results thank you

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:36,390
hello I am Angelina's um from Republic

00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,900
of Kosovo and I'm here to represent my

00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:43,080
google Summer of Code project my mentors

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:46,260
are Bruno Molina and Gabriella so my

00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:51,089
project is a mozilla firefox web

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:53,190
extension to give free and to give free

00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:56,130
software alternatives to the apps on

00:16:53,190 --> 00:17:00,029
internet so to help avoiding non free

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:03,720
apps and sites so the goals for this

00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:05,970
project were that while the user is

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:11,160
surfing on the Internet at the moment

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:14,189
that he uses a non-free software or my

00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,829
extension will detect it and then give

00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:19,650
an alternative to it a free software

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:22,040
alternative the users should be able to

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,059
stop it when it's annoying and the

00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,020
notifications should be only once

00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:31,230
precession and we wanted to have like a

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:34,290
database through a self-hosted API or to

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:37,940
use a free software device and then all

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:41,850
this database to show it on a web page I

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,280
started by making by making the user

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,950
experience design being based on that

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,290
because it should work like it should

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,660
work fine I made some sketches and

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:54,240
mock-ups and then the persona and then

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,090
defining bad habits of apps like a

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,650
research and then I started implementing

00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,620
it by coding it

00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:04,400
I used Mozilla API to make my extension

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:07,890
communicate with the web browser API I

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,620
created a JSON data file it's like a

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,840
proof of concept to just take that data

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:18,300
cuz this is gonna be later in a real

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:20,790
database so the the code logic to select

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:24,240
on display that are alternative based on

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:27,000
the current active website is that we

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,060
should get the URL identify it by

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,280
sanding identify it and then to send to

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:35,340
that JSON file check that

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,100
and based on that to give an alternate

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,350
if it if it exists of course we didn't

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,540
want to want to allow it the users to

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,150
show like too much notification so we

00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,670
made it only once procession for the

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,160
current app and it has the ability to

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:53,460
stop and started we use the local

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,100
storage to hold the user settings and

00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,950
then we have to present this free

00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,820
software list through a web page that is

00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:05,070
generated by that database this is like

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,100
a simple diagram of basically what I

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,350
just said

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,270
these are some screenshots with words

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:16,830
for example drug box is a non-free

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:19,770
software and this is the notification

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:23,340
that it gets it says roebucks has open

00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:26,940
source alternatives like like see a file

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:30,840
and then I have here the the webpage

00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:33,120
that it gets the extension pop-up and

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,690
all this thing this is how it looks like

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,660
and then I made a project website which

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,850
should hold all the data I made the

00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,400
design of it on the front end and the

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:47,130
data generation I plan to leave this

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,220
open so developers can add stuff there

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:53,430
too to the database and then it

00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:57,840
generates it and it goes like right away

00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:59,610
today to the project website I don't

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,590
need to hold code hard-coded or

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,900
something then I made the documentation

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,140
of that I split it in in three sections

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:10,080
and the information about the project

00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,660
general things what's its purpose how it

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,850
works and the second one is the

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,800
contribution who can developers

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:21,480
contribute it and the third one is about

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,490
technical aspects like debugging and

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,240
cloning the repo for new developers so

00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:30,840
this is like an example of it and for

00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:33,360
the future I plan to continue my project

00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,400
even after google Summer of Code the

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,970
first thing I need to do like probably

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:42,630
now I am going to put it on the Mozilla

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:45,990
Firefox market and later I can make it

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:48,420
for other browsers like chromium but we

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,760
need to change the API there and I

00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,670
thought of packaging it in Debian cuz

00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,400
while I was here I learned about

00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:58,679
packaging and streaming and all that

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,140
stuff so I think I'm probably gonna do

00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:04,740
that but not for now cuz I want my users

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,550
to be like all Internet users not just

00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,100
there be an operating system users

00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:12,059
another thing is that I want to think

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,600
integrated with other free software

00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:17,490
services like SUSE artificial

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,420
intelligence and Thunderbird and

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,460
upstream Suzy is the speeching and

00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:26,250
texting artificial intelligence that

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,190
gives you responses and I plan to use

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:33,480
that on giving like the suggestions by

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:37,110
speech and my extension with Thunderbird

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,330
I thought it might like to work like in

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,880
Mozilla but you know when a user gets an

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:45,179
email from a non-free site then it

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,550
should sent the a suggestions you use

00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:50,220
this don't use this like I just

00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,980
basically explained and with upstream I

00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:56,160
thought like all my database should be

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:59,540
there to put it there and it could help

00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,790
upstream and it could help me I have my

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:05,250
here my experience with Debian I heard

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,920
about Debian last year in a girls

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:11,850
hackathon and then later in Tirana

00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:16,050
Albania we made a book squashing party I

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:19,980
did he was there and we planned on what

00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:24,390
sorry I'm working on it more than with

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:27,030
Daniel Pocock we had in May a speech

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,920
together we came on the biggest open

00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,770
source conference in the whole Balkans

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,900
it was about free software and about my

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,910
project I read the whole book to

00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,640
understand it a little bit more to be

00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,800
more prepared and I want to thank Debian

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,290
people for giving me this opportunity to

00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,320
talk here in front of you and I'll hope

00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:49,670
I'll be a DD soon thank you

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,670
[Applause]

00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:59,590
so yeah it's working so before my name

00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,380
is Selena and you Nancy bouquet and I

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:05,110
come from Co so before I start before I

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,630
want to start to present my project I

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,670
want to mention that this year in the G

00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:12,970
sock is the first time that our country

00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:15,730
is participating so it was funny because

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:19,060
even when we had to apply for the G sock

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:22,930
we had asked Google to add our country

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:25,000
in the list so you know how we we

00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:28,570
thought that we didn't have and many

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,460
more opportunities or any piece of

00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,790
thought they are not going to accept us

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:36,910
but hopefully for us we had a great

00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:40,240
mentor Daniel Park I think many of many

00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:42,930
of you guys know him and he helped us

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,150
with everything that we needed for the

00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:48,850
for the power our pre-k application and

00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:52,990
everything else so going back to my

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:55,660
project my project is basically what I

00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,610
just said right now so knowing that new

00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:01,780
commerce the open source have a lot of

00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:04,540
problems to do just to set up a

00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:10,240
development environment I'm sorry I'm

00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:14,860
requirement and that's why we wanted to

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:18,340
create to create a queen so my project

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:21,280
is a new country contributor wizard and

00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:25,810
it's basically a great that it will be

00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:30,010
distributed as a package and to help the

00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:33,130
newcomers Debian an open source to start

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:35,830
their work on and work on the open

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:38,080
source projects for example if you want

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:41,080
to apply in google Summer of Code or our

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,300
treaty or other programs like this you

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,100
will need a lot of things because if you

00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:48,700
are a new new person used to you and

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:51,460
coming to Debian or any other version of

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:55,450
Linux you have a lot of problem to start

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,640
up so what we want to do with this is to

00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,100
help students do

00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,740
around this computer program in their

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,180
desktop and help them to understand

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,640
everything that they need for example

00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:10,180
they will need for sure that how to use

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,430
IRC they will need basically a blog to

00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,810
explain their work or a portfolio or

00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:18,730
anything so they will need a PGP or and

00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:21,670
other things like this that we usually

00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:26,740
use an open source so my part of the

00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:29,740
project in this in this month's of the

00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:33,100
google Summer of Code it was - it was

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:36,090
the blog module basically I created a

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:41,440
module that will generate automatically

00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:43,330
by dynamic and Static websites and the

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,580
other part of it it was that I did a lot

00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:49,330
a lot of research that what students

00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:53,800
need for and we should include in the

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:56,410
wizard another thing is that I want to

00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:00,580
mention is that students sit and don't

00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:03,030
know that much for hey if they have a

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:06,130
problems using terminal or installing

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:09,280
programs when they usually install

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:14,530
Debian so you make sure to add like a

00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:16,780
tutorials or for example or description

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:19,300
or something that will help them how to

00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:22,240
proceed and apply and maybe be a

00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:25,560
successful applicant for zeesoc so

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,560
that's it thank you

00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:56,430
hello everyone my name is Giovanni and I

00:27:53,250 --> 00:28:00,090
also come from Kosovo I am a student of

00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:02,570
computer science and engineering I'm

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:05,670
finishing my studies this year hopefully

00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:08,250
so I am also doing a google Summer of

00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:12,650
Code project I haven't prepared any

00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:17,430
slides because I didn't see it necessary

00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:20,130
so my project name is click to dial up

00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:24,150
rambling ancestor and my mentor is

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:27,810
thomas levine he couldn't join it the

00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:31,100
conference this year so what i've been

00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:34,020
working in this project is that we

00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:37,620
thought we are three students in this

00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:42,860
project because it's really big thing we

00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,860
started working in this last year in the

00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:50,970
we started doing the project in Python

00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:54,620
first we did some pop-ups and some some

00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:57,570
really basic things so we thought to

00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,940
continue that but now that the project

00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,670
is bigger and there are three students

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,820
doing this it is separated into

00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:09,330
different things and the two other

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:12,320
students are doing something else and we

00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:16,890
plan to do something like mobile

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:20,160
application but still haven't figured

00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:26,400
out for the moment we are doing only a

00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:30,660
website web application and we're

00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,130
working on existing projects that google

00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:35,550
Summer of Code students have done before

00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:38,130
like omni tail and looming Lumi call I

00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:41,070
am basically working on them and making

00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:45,150
changes and doing tasks classes and

00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:46,680
methods so after we finished that I

00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:50,370
think we will continue with

00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:54,330
website and hopefully because the ji-suk

00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:58,110
is really coming to an end and we have

00:29:54,330 --> 00:30:00,090
not very much time left but after this

00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:05,070
probably we will be working and doing a

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:08,370
mobile app however this is all I have to

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,690
tell right now about my project thank

00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,820
you very much thank you for the

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:15,530
opportunity to be here and to present

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,530
for you guys

00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:44,790
okay so can you hear me no okay so hi

00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:46,980
everyone I am not actually Google Summer

00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:52,490
of Code student but I've been at an

00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:56,070
outreach in turn around one year ago so

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:59,460
first before continuing my talk I'd like

00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:01,680
to ask how many of you are coming from a

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:06,170
social background and has not finished

00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,320
for computer science or science related

00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:09,690
okay

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,270
great so we got three other people in

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:15,350
the audience so I am Christie program

00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:18,050
actually I finished my University for

00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:20,520
international affairs and diplomacy and

00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:23,070
in the beginning I thought that this was

00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:26,100
exactly the school but I'll never ever

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:29,040
find something to do with my life but

00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,750
then I thought that okay probably it

00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,720
would be nice if I could just merge it

00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,760
with something that is tech related and

00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,860
free software since during that time I

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,320
was also part of the free software

00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,870
community so I ended up in the end

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,860
having diploma thesis for online

00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:50,250
diplomacy and this was what kind of

00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:54,600
opened the doors further to continue and

00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:59,910
to get to know more for political and

00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:02,340
Internet so I applied in Mozilla team

00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,470
for taking part in the outreach II

00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,860
working with the diversity and inclusion

00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:09,900
team they're building up the strategy

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,450
for conducting the first language

00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:14,910
interviews since one of the barriers

00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,230
that we've had during all this time was

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:20,400
that there were people coming from

00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:23,750
different different countries and not

00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,920
speaking everyone by default English so

00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,840
trying to have a strategy on how to

00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,840
conduct the link on how to conduct

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,410
interviews and to grow up communities in

00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,120
the local aspect would really help to

00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:38,340
take in the further step all the free

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:42,650
software initiative and everything

00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:44,940
that's regarding to that so this was

00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,780
kind of the aspect and the feel that

00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,970
I've been

00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,940
on the outreach for those who don't know

00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:52,680
how treaty it's exactly it's an

00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,020
internship that is for like that lasts

00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:59,790
for three months it happened twice per

00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:02,700
year it has kind of the same ideology as

00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:04,650
the google Summer of Code but it's also

00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:08,430
for people that are not students but

00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:12,300
that have finished their their studies

00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:14,340
and besides out Ricci and Google Summer

00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:19,110
of Code there are also other initiatives

00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:21,480
that helps out students to continue and

00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:24,210
getting on more knowledge regarding the

00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,520
free software such as real rails girls

00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,900
Summer of Code I don't know if you've

00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,990
heard about that it's an internship

00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:34,680
happening on the only during the summer

00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:37,980
it lasts for three miles three months

00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:41,250
I think and it's actually only regarding

00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:43,620
the coding but till now I think that for

00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:46,740
as far as I know it which is the only

00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:50,580
one that can that requires also people

00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:52,530
that do not have technical skills or at

00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:56,430
least that have finished that have not

00:33:52,530 --> 00:34:00,480
finished for any technical subject or

00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:03,750
degree so this was also my short

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,850
presentation let's say and the last one

00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,470
I think for the session so if there is

00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,330
anyone in the audience would like to

00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,929
make a question any suggestion or

00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:16,159
comment please feel free and thank you

00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,159
very much for being here

00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:47,170
hello Germany so many of us are so

00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:49,390
interested in the the edges of Debian

00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:53,500
and who's coming and are they staying

00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:55,030
and you've met so many mentees and

00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,270
talked to so many mentors could you

00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:00,100
share with us a little bit about what is

00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:09,070
working well and what might work a

00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:11,560
little better in the future so there are

00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:13,840
many newcomers coming from google Summer

00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,300
of Code I think the main thing that

00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,550
should happen is they should be keep

00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,890
motivated and keep working on after the

00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,810
google Summer of Code that I feel that

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,540
that would be one of the major thing

00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:27,900
they had to do even after the google

00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,900
Summer of Code

00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:42,210
do you have ideas of how community

00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,300
members or the mentors could do things

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:51,720
differently so that they could stay more

00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:53,310
motivated stay more interested I think

00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,260
the mentors it's all about the

00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,240
communication I think they should keep

00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:01,890
communicating with the students and keep

00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:04,170
them giving suggestions and advising

00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:07,200
them how can they improve further on

00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:11,190
their projects and how can they keep

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,530
moving keep moving on the further with

00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,660
the project so listening to what their

00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:27,660
interests are and giving them ideas of

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:29,610
how to pursue those interests yep I have

00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:32,130
a question is it I have the impression

00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:37,550
but I might be wrong so do you have

00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:37,550
questions for me or students all right

00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:44,850
but just what I've been following for

00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:48,180
the past years I think when students

00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:49,890
enter work with a team my impression is

00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:55,350
that is easier for them to continue

00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:58,590
working afterwards is it in comparison

00:36:55,350 --> 00:37:01,530
when there are docked projects that

00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:05,580
sometimes don't continue being developed

00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:08,640
and I think yeah then the motivation

00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:11,010
might fall but do you perceive it or you

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,470
don't think it makes sense currently and

00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:16,200
not but I hope to continue it for the

00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:18,990
after my now I'm currently into early

00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Korea so I would prefer continuing later

00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:24,690
yeah sorry I think you didn't understand

00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,630
my question it was about the projects in

00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,700
within teams like let's say the students

00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:33,570
that work with a per team or the work

00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:39,630
inside another team in comparison with

00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:43,740
just one mentor and mana mentee and if

00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:45,660
that reflects on the motivation of the

00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:48,390
student to continue in depth doing work

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,170
for Debian afterwards they think there

00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:52,470
is a

00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,839
relation or not yeah I think I think

00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,760
there is literally I mean the mint you

00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:00,000
mean the mentor-mentee relationship

00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:07,019
going on yeah I made sure that I go to

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:09,299
your question probably do you think it's

00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:13,440
easier for students to be part of a team

00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:15,779
instead of just one mentor yeah I think

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,910
they they get I was knowledge so it's

00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:22,109
better to be in a tea rather than

00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:25,079
sticking to one mentor do you do we have

00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:27,329
some statistics how many of the students

00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,490
remains in debian or not because I have

00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:31,619
had sweet Google some of course students

00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:35,369
and three out Ritchie Ritchie students

00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:39,210
and none of them really remained

00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:41,880
interested I used using Davion but my

00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:44,069
experience also a result of my

00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,160
experience was that I tried to give them

00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:50,010
tasks which are easily to end which are

00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,529
small tasks and if say cold and that's

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:59,519
not bad how many people stayed in in

00:38:52,529 --> 00:39:02,220
Debian you mean you mean from the past

00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:05,609
how many people stayed in Tavian of the

00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:10,079
students how many from the past yeah you

00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:13,140
don't know in the future I think that

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,509
you can answer him after the session

00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,289
okay because we ran out okay I would

00:39:15,509 --> 00:39:19,289
like to take this opportunity

00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:21,750
opportunity to thank all the mentors who

00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:23,279
made this program successful and you can

00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,019
feel free to talk with students after

00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:28,980
the session and give them such

00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:34,389
suggestions or feedback thank you

00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,389
