	00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:09,760
it's the morning after the debconf wine

00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:12,520
and cheese so attendance is a bit sparse

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,309
but that's okay we're doing this for the

00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:21,000
audience online and for the recordings

00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:25,150
that will be made available later so

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,770
Martin and I are members of the SPI

00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,369
Board of Governors and we're here to

00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:33,820
provide a synopsis of our activities

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:35,800
over the last year and in the format of

00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,530
a Boff and if there are questions either

00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,879
online or from the room we're happy to

00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,030
take them at the end of the presentation

00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:47,170
so we also will describe a little bit

00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:53,649
what SPI is because we cannot be sure

00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:56,709
that everyone knows what SPI is about so

00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,609
this is our agenda and in fact if we're

00:00:56,709 --> 00:01:00,519
going to give it a little bit of a

00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:02,260
presentation about the purpose of SPI

00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:05,049
perhaps we should do that before we dive

00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:08,670
into the board software the public

00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:10,630
interest is a registered nonprofit

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,990
organization in the United States and

00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:17,590
the in the state of New York

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:21,370
we exist primarily to hold the tangible

00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,110
assets of member organizations call them

00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,090
associated projects dead in is the

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,590
largest but we have a number of other

00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:31,470
ones and by tangible assets I mean cash

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,900
in bank accounts in the United States or

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,430
trademarks or patents we don't have any

00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,660
patents yet but we could hold patents

00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:44,860
for organizations and our job really at

00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:47,110
the end of the day is to do we are here

00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,360
to provide accounts receivable and

00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,960
accounts payable services for these

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,510
projects that is the primary mission if

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,260
you will of the organization there we

00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,790
also hold the mains for several projects

00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,720
and sorry yes and domain names which are

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,180
also assets

00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,080
so from Debian's perspective we are only

00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,479
one of several trusted organizations but

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,150
for the other projects that we are the

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:17,440
hosts we are the only organization that

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:20,140
they work with so SPI started from

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,820
Debian membership but the people that

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,840
stood it up understood that there was a

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:29,020
need for an organization that could be

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,110
pan or larger than Debian alone could

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,670
offer similar services to many open

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,150
source organizations whether or not they

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:39,270
were small or large in size so this is

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,530
the agenda that we'll go through today

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,620
we'll start with the board composition

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:53,410
and directors and officers and our

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:55,330
meeting structure so we had some changes

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,660
this year

00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:01,170
yuck yeah spurt a long term board member

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:07,950
and vice president of SPI

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:11,800
resigned and mid of February I think and

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:15,130
due to lack of time and SPI by its

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:18,190
bylaws allows that the board itself may

00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:22,800
appoint an interim director to the board

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:28,180
and try lacroix from the Jenkins project

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:33,870
and one other person said they are going

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:37,180
to stand for that and the board finally

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:42,600
appointed Tyler Crowe as an interim

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:47,860
director in in March during its monthly

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:52,690
online meeting we were in the position a

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:57,190
few years ago where so usually board of

00:03:52,690 --> 00:04:00,100
directors is a three-year term for so

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,700
you if you stand up for for a board of

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:06,780
director at SPI you're getting voted for

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,340
for three years and we usually have

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,209
three person at the board consists of

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:17,530
nine persons and total and we usually

00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:21,459
have like three persons a year standing

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:24,160
up for vote that shifted a little bit a

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:29,080
few years ago because of

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,820
several persons resigning and we were in

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,490
the position where we assembly had like

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,940
five persons that needed to be voted on

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:40,870
and to get to go back to a three by

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:47,860
three by three vote again

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:50,470
Luka resigned this year early to get

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:55,390
reelected this year so in the beginning

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:58,030
though with a beginning term now in then

00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:02,680
with the next meeting in August we are

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:07,750
back to three three three again so I'm

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:12,270
be had the vote for the board of

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:18,150
directors the last two weeks three weeks

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:22,770
and the actual vote result came out on

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:31,830
fry noodles Friday last week I think so

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:35,470
yeah where sadly tie lack Troy was

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:39,760
usually you get you stand up for vote

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:41,200
when you get appointed as a interim

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,570
director SATA lead

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,050

vote so all those people for not

00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,890
watching themselves yeah and thanks for

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,600
everybody who voted I actually don't

00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,280
know what the voting statistics are in

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,260
terms of a number of unique votes I

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,530
don't think that was included an email

00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,530
but

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:25,200
you know I've got a green light yellow

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,330
it was only about 40 people voted in the

00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,020
election I think we've got somewhere

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,370
between two and three hundred

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,920
contributing members at the Manatee

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,600
could have voted yeah I did I actually

00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,330
talked to a couple of contributing

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,990
members who weren't voting and they

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,700
explained that they didn't feel they

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,710
could make an informed decision they

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,030
didn't know any of the candidates well

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,630
enough to be able to distinguish between

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,800
them and weren't particularly oh my god

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,570
this kind of is amazing order this

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,860
candidates someone I definitely don't

00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,510
want then and that's why they didn't

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,180
vote so it wasn't that they weren't

00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,950
engaged it was that they didn't feel

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,140
that they could they will be voting for

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:06,630
the sake of voting okay they did ask few

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:08,280
people so as of August 2018 then the

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,050
board of directors of SPI are the

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,210
following individuals myself Stephen

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,910
frost Jimmy Kaplowitz

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:18,630
Martin Michael Meyer Tim Potter Michael

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,310
Schell theis andrew tridgell oh but

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:27,830
didn't butcher that name valerie young

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:30,840
and Martin's Oba Hollis and the officers

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,760
currently are Martin myself Valerie and

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,470
Michael but that changes in the next two

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,840
weeks at our next meeting since we just

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,150
had the election we cycle the officers

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,290
every year the board elects its own

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:45,540
officers from its membership so from

00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:49,740
that previous slide those are the people

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:51,330
eligible to be the officers and I'll

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,090
finish with this one and then we can

00:07:51,330 --> 00:08:00,330
switch board meetings we meet every

00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:01,650
month online in IRC in the SPI Channel

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,180
I just recently changed the

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,470
configuration there so you do need to be

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,940
registered in order to speak in the

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,130
channel because the spam that we've been

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,760
receiving but we're there every month

00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:14,520
and we advertise the meetings in advance

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,200
and the agendas and events on the SPI

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,120
announce mailing list so please check

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,850
that mailing list because of the lot

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,360
final slide I believe finally we do meet

00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:29,000
once per year we started this in 2016 I

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:31,040
believe and the intent here is to

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,599
spend some time together as boards it's

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,500
not some of us don't know each other and

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:39,380
to really focus on vision strategy

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,650
roadmap and operational concerns it's in

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,060
effect the SPI board sprint we do it

00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,920
every year in New York we are in New

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,300
York registered organization so it's

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,030
appropriate to do it in New York we

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,690
currently meet at our lawyer's office so

00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:55,010
that we have client confidentiality but

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,310
we could meet somewhere else this year

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:01,340
we're talking about venues but the

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,540
intent is to have this sprint so if

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,580
there are things that you want us to be

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,350
working on now is the time to bring them

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,570
up because it's really during those

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:12,920
Sprint's that we try to make progress on

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:16,700
them also we try to keep the

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,910
face-to-face meeting close to the vote

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,500
we had so we can actually do some

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,540
onboarding with the new team members of

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:30,940
the boat board

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:37,100
sorry yeah I looked up some of

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:42,290
membership statistics we had five over

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:45,890
500 active contributing members and 2016

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:49,700
and then this number decreased very much

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:55,910
and 2017 but that's due to the fact that

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:58,670
we or Jonathan that membership hang to

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,850
all of the contributing members and a

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:04,370
lot of contributing at that time

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:08,870
contributing members either said they

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:11,600
won't be active and they longer or they

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:15,920
didn't respond to the pings so that's

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:22,160
the reason why this number decreased so

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:26,510
much yeah so the the the key point here

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,830
is that we embarked on a membership

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,040
cleanup over the last little while

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:35,030
because we have a bylaw revamp and the

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,680
current bylaw by laws are written in

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,750
such a way that the quorum necessary to

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,430
get revisions passed is extremely the

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:47,220
bar is very high the next revision

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:49,529
the bars lower and we need a a roster

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,460
that reflects the connective membership

00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:55,380
so that when we send out the vote for

00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,300
the voter request for the new bylaws we

00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,399
are not sending it to a population that

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:03,060
we could never achieve quorum on because

00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:05,820
they're not active so you people may not

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,100
have been active in the in the election

00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,500
of board officers and your explanation

00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,510
was helpful thank you but we really do

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,160
need people to make an effort on voting

00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,810
on the bylaws there are important

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,760
changes in there one of which is the

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,550
quorum requirement for our future bylaw

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,040
changes it will leave us somewhat

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,200
paralyzed if we can never never even

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,390
propose minor bylaw changes and meet

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,480
this enormous behind quorum requirement

00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,550
and especially as a lot of active

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,170
contributing members are Debian

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:42,230
developers please if you see the vault

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:42,230
on the bylaws go vote go and vote on it

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,870
so membership applications SPI is not

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,820
membership and SPI is not limited to

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:55,320
people who are part of an Associated

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:57,180
project so you may make an application

00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,130
you can become a non contributing member

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,650
you can also make an application to

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,820
become a contributing member the

00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,400
contributing members are the ones that

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,709
then are offered the opportunity to vote

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,420
it's the only real differentiating

00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:11,970
factor but it's an important factor spi

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,430
exists to support these organizations in

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,980
their administrative responsibilities so

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,990
it's not as fun as some of the other

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,779
people might take on but it's stuff that

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:24,420
needs to end needs to get done you need

00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:26,040
to be active member to be on the board I

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,560
need to be an active member to be on the

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:37,290
board we've had some changes in project

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:41,430
roster freedombox became their own a 501

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:43,040
C 3 3 C 3 and some projects cease to

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,540
operate and we're in the process of

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,399
cleaning that up too

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:54,630
to prepare some board resolutions to

00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:57,209
dispose of their assets if any etc we

00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:01,860
are already in contact with them some of

00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:04,380
them do respond some don't met Wi-Fi for

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,690
example responded recently that they

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:10,889
want their funds to be transferred to

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:14,389
another SPI associative project which is

00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:17,819
fine and we have several that are

00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:19,319
seeking to be on boarded but until that

00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:25,319
concludes I'm not going to enumerate

00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:27,449
them on the slide and this came sorry we

00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:29,850
didn't do a good job of getting all of

00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:31,500
these logos into the slide deck this is

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,519
from the annual report the last page of

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,800
the ANA report yeah has been published

00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:41,459
two weeks ago yeah just before the vote

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,000
so again Debian is the largest member of

00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:47,310
SPI associated project in SPI but we

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,360
provide services to 40-plus

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:53,370
organizations some of which you may know

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,250
or use even at home yourself like open

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:59,670
wrt or what have you

00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:03,000
oft see if you on IRC Postgres for

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:06,120
example then there's they were ID the

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,889
zero ad game Jenkins

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:15,060
for example the deeper office open

00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:18,089
document validation our clinics just to

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:27,779
list a few our clinics 32 as well as

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:30,839
onboarding okay yeah I can give a little

00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:36,899
bit feedback of the financial position

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:39,689
of SPI we changed a lot regarding the

00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,620
triggering process in the past's one and

00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:45,720
a half years I

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,720
becoming more and more assistant

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:57,670
treasurer to SPI and we also changed the

00:14:51,070 --> 00:15:00,640
way be a processing financial data as it

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:03,460
becomes more and more crucial to SPI as

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:09,460
we are holding a lot of assets as you

00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:12,570
can see we also moved a lot of money

00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:17,950
around as you might see if last year

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:22,300
most of that as two or three no actually

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:26,800
three big conference one of was that

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,630
conf last year the other two were Libre

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:37,330
Office conference and the conference

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:41,290
from the xorg foundation so and we had a

00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:44,680
generous donations in the past years to

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:47,890
both our associated projects and

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:52,240
directly to SPI so if you are looking at

00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:55,240
the total amount that SPI owns that's

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,200
more or less due to a very genius

00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:02,709
donation from Craigslist and the past's

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:06,339
ongoing over the past three years we

00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:12,870
hold a little bit more than a million US

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:17,560
dollar interest in total we're off a

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:23,290
800,000 nearly 900,000 with The

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:25,930
Associated projects so recent

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,690
accomplishments over the last year as

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:31,420
Obul mentioned there have been financial

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,860
process improvements we're trying to get

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:38,080
the annual reports out in a more timely

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,670
fashion we moved from the previous

00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,790
first-past-the-post kind of voting with

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:47,529
medicaid method to single transferable

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,540
vote which was actually in 2016 I think

00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,670
the

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:56,190
this year was the first year where we

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:58,290
actually voted with this vote mechanism

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,980
last year we didn't had any vote on

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,630
going because we had three officers up

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,870
for vote no to what

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,820
two officers up for vote and two

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:12,960
officers standing so we didn't need to

00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:14,730
old last year we implemented a virtual

00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,700
mailing address and phone number by

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,140
which I mean there are services around

00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,080
the United States that offer the ability

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,910
to accept mail physical mail they scan

00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,650
the envelope you ask them to open it

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,080
they scan the content if it's a check we

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,880
can ask them to deposit in the bank this

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,560
has been very helpful because in the

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,420
past we used to use a post-office box

00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,880
close to Michael's house so Michael

00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,700
sometimes didn't have an opportunity to

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,800
swing by frequently with this mechanism

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:45,600
Michael can deposit checks with the

00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:49,140
click of a mouse which is done actually

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:57,150
done nowadays by Martin Michael Mayer

00:17:49,140 --> 00:18:00,810
and me and yeah we also get all the the

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:04,410
nice thing we as we can also archive all

00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:07,620
the staff that goes to our post address

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:12,330
as a PDF we directly get it scanned

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:16,920
every time a letter comes in so we

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:20,220
actually have a track of what comes in

00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:25,500
and have that and a version control

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:27,690
system so we do have all the data at one

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,400
single place now so it sounds like a

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,350
minor thing but it's been a pretty

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,890
dramatic improvement to the flow of

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:37,380
incoming donations and we also have a

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,810
Google Voice phone number it only goes

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,210
to voicemail at the moment but we

00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:45,600
acquire that for identity verification

00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:48,090
purposes so we've had a need in a couple

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,680
of times to acquire an extended

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,110
validation domain

00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,580
sorry extended validation x.509

00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:58,440
certificate for a particular domain and

00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,850
the various registrar's have

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,470
different processes by which they do

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,930
extend a validation some of which

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:06,930
include phoning the organization at the

00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,490
number of their business so they leave a

00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:11,130
voicemail we call them back and we tell

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,780
them yes we really are the parent

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,160
organization for Debbie and at least as

00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:20,580
far as the United States is concerned

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:25,020
and we approve the release of a x.509

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:27,120
certificate and also individual members

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,880
of the Board of Directors have Google

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,670
Voice numbers nowadays which makes it

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,580
easier for example getting in contact

00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:38,010
with a US bank without them asking why

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:41,730
gee why are you calling from a Japanese

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:46,190
or German or Australia Australian number

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:49,590
which they mod might consider as fraud

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,840
yep so it's been it's been interesting

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,030
trying to explain to organisations the

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,440
virtual nature of SBI that's put it that

00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,660
way and the fact that we're

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,400
international in in structure and we

00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,180
have board members that are not

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,610
necessarily US citizens the last two

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,800
Sprint's I've attended we spent a lot of

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:13,800
time at G focusing on clarity admission

00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:17,090
and governance improvements so I led the

00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,650
conversation at this ball by saying that

00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:22,440
at the end of the day our job is to hold

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,060
pile of assets and to do accounts

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,960
payable and accounts receivable so

00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,960
that's the kind of

00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:34,259
position statement I've been making at

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:36,239
these these face-to-face meetings and my

00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:38,489
fellow board members have come round to

00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:41,039
that viewpoint we need to be able to do

00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:43,619
the basics of what spi is intended to do

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:48,029
before we step up and try to do other

00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:50,820
services for associated projects so the

00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:52,710
last year has seen movements the DEP

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:57,200
cop17 reimbursement for example was

00:20:52,710 --> 00:21:00,929
different and was better we've we've

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,609
expected team of people work we related

00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:05,039
items it was just Michael at the

00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:07,349
beginning now there are nearly four

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,070
people that do it on a regular basis

00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:12,720
I've identified a staff member from the

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,049
University where I work she used to work

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,450
for me Sabrina she does accounts payable

00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:33,179
and receivable is her day job and she's

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:36,479
now FBI to bolt team so so what we hope

00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:42,359
to have over the year is time amongst

00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:46,129
the new you spend time training this is

00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,129
not working ok

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:58,669
let me turn it off so what we hope to

00:21:51,919 --> 00:22:01,340
have is time over the next time over the

00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:05,929
next year to get Sabrina trained so

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,909
Sabrina doesn't know yet necessarily and

00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:09,649
doesn't know Ledger so we need to get

00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,869
her in that direction but in terms of

00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:14,749
helping us document policies and

00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:17,509
procedures around the reimbursement

00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:19,039
process and then actually executing the

00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:20,989
reimbursement process to the point where

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,049
she's authorized to do the funds

00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:31,460
transfers what is where we want to get

00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:34,700
to the next year also one of the uterus

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:37,600
things we achieved in the past year is

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:42,649
getting a directors and officer officers

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:48,139
liability insurance which is some sort

00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:51,200
of crucial in the yes to have it took us

00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:56,119
a while to find an organization in the

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:59,080
u.s. that covers our one 501c3

00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:03,679
organization but that finally worked out

00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:11,830
and that got signs I think October or

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:17,210
November last year so director insurance

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:19,039
we were personally liable for were

00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,830
personally liable for the activities of

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,629
spi directors our and so director

00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,820
insurance is so that I don't lose my

00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:31,879
house if SBI gets sued by somebody and

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:33,679
wins because otherwise why would why

00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,789
would anybody become an SPI director if

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,210
they're personally liable for the

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:39,649
activities of the organization and

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:43,399
another thing that we have been working

00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:48,010
on the past two years of the new bylaws

00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:52,480
they are got completely rewritten and

00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:54,520
we had a lawyer reviewing the new bylaws

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,140
are actually helping us to write the new

00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:02,400
bylaws and thanks to Jimmy caplovitz as

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:07,179
board member and in Jackson being very

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:11,500
helpful on the SPI mailing list to

00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:14,950
actually get the new bylaws in a way

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:18,580
that the associated projects wanted but

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:26,860
also as the board wants to have it so

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:30,340
again please get out the vote okay

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:33,220
future objectives again back to that

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,540
idea that our primary goal is asset

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,850
management and accounts payable and

00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,200
accounts receivable we need to get away

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,780
from the single point of failure we've

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,630
done that quite a bit with the now for

00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,250
board members doing the work we need to

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:48,390
document everything so there's a lot of

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:50,770
information in the head of Michael or

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:53,080
DBM or what-have-you we need to get that

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:56,230
down on paper we need to be able to

00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,970
survive a large-scale board transition

00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:03,250
without having to always go back and ask

00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:09,940
questions of previous directors we need

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:12,760
more rigorous processes right now I

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,010
think we don't transition for example

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,110
all of the signing authorities of the

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,910
bank accounts on a timely fashion that's

00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,400
part of the reason for doing the face to

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:23,350
face in New York is so that if we change

00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,820
the officers and we want different

00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,100
signing authorities to match the

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,690
officers of the organization we can go

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,679
to the three or four banks where we do

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:37,290
business and we can do a and we can do a

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:39,760
signing officer change we don't have an

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:42,580
expense policy so the associated

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,910
organizations might have an expense

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:48,220
policy but many do not so the idea is

00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:51,040
that we would prepare an expense policy

00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,780
for SPI that would be applicable to all

00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,020
associated projects unless they wrote

00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:58,120
their own to supersede it and that way

00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,600
we can get away from is this legitimate

00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,880
expense or not legitimate

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,990
Bent's kind of debate which happens a

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,120
little bit it doesn't happen too

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,620
frequently but again back to the idea

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,890
being more rigorous we do need to write

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,320
down what we believe as an appropriate

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:16,010
expense for an open source and this

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,429
becomes more and more important as the

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:24,919
amount of money the the amount of money

00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:29,900
spi currently holds and Trust we will in

00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:34,669
very near future needs to do an official

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:37,220
financial audit of our bookkeeping and

00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:42,320
they will probably also give us advice

00:26:37,220 --> 00:27:02,650
at what we can expand in which way as we

00:26:42,320 --> 00:27:05,659
are currently doing so the intent is for

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:07,789
the SPI policy to be applied to all

00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:10,520
projects unless the project writes their

00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:13,010
own so Debian just has to write their

00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,570
own expense policy indicating what is

00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:18,770
appropriate or not appropriate from an

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:20,600
expense perspective this isn't meant to

00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,340
be draconian this is just meant to cover

00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,960
cases where nobody has spent the time

00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:28,280
and energy to write their own expense

00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,500
policy we are working on more regular

00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,500
report recently we got a little bit

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:37,010
stuck with some monthly reports we try

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:41,900
to publish because we needed to finish

00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:45,860
the annual report which was a little bit

00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:49,250
of a hassle because one of our banking

00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:51,559
systems changed their API where we could

00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,990
get all the transactions from and it

00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,210
took us like three months to get it in a

00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:59,900
in a way that we can automatically

00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:02,020
process it with ledger and this is one

00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:06,289
of their accounts which has the most

00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:11,950
transactions overall so we had like I

00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:15,380
think Mustafa was like 500 to 600

00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:17,690
transactions to process manually instead

00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:22,010
of automatically to get the financial

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:24,919
report on and one of our board members

00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:27,530
is keen on building the appropriate

00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,530
extracts from ledger to then post them

00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:33,559
on our website and a password-protected

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:36,080
space in order to allow for projects to

00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:38,510
go pull the reports themselves and as

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,570
Luca already already said we are getting

00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:44,659
how a page helped to streamline the

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:52,130
reimbursement process using RT and

00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:54,799
trying to document that workflow more so

00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:56,510
if you want to get involved with us as

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,770
mentioned we have public meetings that

00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:03,350
are held monthly in the SPI channel on

00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:05,390
oft see the agendas are announced in

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:08,320
advance so there's a topic that you want

00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:10,730
to discuss please make sure that you

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,290
reply to the secretary when the first

00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,230
announcement comes out so it gets added

00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:17,480
to the agenda we try very hard not to

00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,120
add on-the-fly agenda items during the

00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,320
meeting because we feel that that is

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,510
inappropriate for people who may have

00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,130
chosen not to attend the meeting because

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:28,190
it didn't have the topic of interest to

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:29,720
them so we are formal we publish agendas

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,429
we discuss the things that are on the

00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,130
agenda at the meeting if you want

00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:36,530
something to discuss please let us know

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:40,490
between those formal meetings we are

00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:42,500
always on the mailing list or available

00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,850
in the channel there are a variety

00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,690
mailing lists

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,710
please check them out and finally of the

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,870
board members

00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:54,070
Martin and I are here so if you have

00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:59,780
questions about SPI or you'd like us to

00:29:54,070 --> 00:30:02,470
address something please seek us out so

00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,470
questions

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:16,200
no it's just only started as a glimmer

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:20,490
of a thought I actually would like to

00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:24,510
come back to report monthly but report

00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:27,510
monthly asked me if the monthly reports

00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:30,419
gone I can't say what the timeline will

00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:36,179
be for getting of what Hector is acting

00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:38,519
asking for as the because I spoke to him

00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:42,059
here at that conf yesterday he wants to

00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:44,639
have the transaction for debconf to be

00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:48,240
online on the website for a DEP conf to

00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:50,700
review that's something we are still

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,120
were a TBM is currently trying to

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,070
extract up from ledger per project but

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,700
we are not in a position yet where we

00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:03,990
can actually give out every single

00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,610
transaction to a project I would also

00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:09,000
like to see that happen

00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:16,970
and during hopefully next at this end in

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,970
the coming year more questions

00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:48,059
it's a lot thank you any more questions

00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:52,669
are our people still trying to wake up

00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:52,669
from last night's cheese and wine partly

00:31:54,590 --> 00:32:23,669
okay I think we'll call it then

00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:25,710
oh there's one more question that's

00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:28,380
actually a good point we could we could

00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:30,240
move them a little bit rather than

00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:34,049
having them always at the same time so

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:39,690
currently the the online meetings are

00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:42,149
optimized in a way that all SPI board

00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:46,110
members can attend and we do have two

00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:48,090
spi board members from Australia getting

00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,940
up at I think five o'clock in the

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:55,169
morning to attempt the meetings some of

00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,899
us are just going to bed in Europe and

00:32:55,169 --> 00:33:00,000
the others time

00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:05,490
I'm foregoing my lunch in order to

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,779
attend a meeting but it's a good point

00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,270
we'll bring it up at the first meeting

00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:10,409
of the next meeting of the of the board

00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:13,500
as to whether or not we should have a

00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:14,760
bit of a rotating a moving schedule so

00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,000
that we can accommodate more people what

00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,779
do you what you could do is bring that

00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,200
topic up on the SPI discuss mailing list

00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:27,779
for the board members to look into that

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:32,549
if we can a little bit shift per meeting

00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:34,860
so people from different time zones do

00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:39,169
have the possibility to attend at least

00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,169
a few meetings a year thank you

00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:47,370
it seems we do not have any more

00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,409
questions I do have a few stickers from

00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,169
SBI in the front so in case you want

00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:57,480
stickers just come to the front take a

00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:59,730
few and leave a few for others yeah then

00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,159
thank you and catch us here if you do

00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:05,429
have questions which you do not want to

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:10,010
ask knowledge or in the question session

00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:14,849
of our SBI both thanks very much

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,849
