from Vietnam I'd run for Asia

00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,039
organization supporting open source and

00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,570
free software movement in Asia we are

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,000
connected with many developer

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,610
communities and of course dbn is that

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,130
one of our flavors so we we host I think

on stage would be sick excellent

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,070
developers Debian developers coming from

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,050
very diverse backgrounds and especially

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:57,380
they come from six different regions

00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,809
around the world so today they will

00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,610
share with us their life story

00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,860
experiences challenging working in the

00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,200
community and on storoe they will

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,780
suggest ideas and best practices how we

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,770
can scale as the same project within

00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:16,069
Debian with that I would start to drift

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:20,959

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,680
to ask it panda late this question what

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,530

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,160

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,480
it'll finally please tell us one thing

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:37,880
about you the people he wouldn't know so

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:41,370
I was back with their video ok let's see

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,710
the story of how I became involved in

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,980
Debian is actually kind of long and

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,010
involved but interesting there was a

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,350
reporter in the UK several years ago who

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,840
published a lengthy interview with me

00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,500
with lots and lots of details the very

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:02,190
short version is that I was involved in

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,560
a project to develop a payload for an

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,760
amateur radio satellite and I was

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,780
collaborating with people in many

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,030
different countries and this was before

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:15,960
Linux had become a really big deal and

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,660
one of my friends started using Linux as

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,450
his platform for working on the project

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,120
and that caused me to begin to take

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:27,360
Linux seriously and I started looking

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,450
for which sort of version of Linux I

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,250
should play with and I discovered that

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,710
there was an effort to figure out how to

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,050
use Debian for doing ham radio related

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,720
work and that's sort of the thing that

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:44,550
brought me into the project I got sucked

00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,919
in very very quickly and within 2 or 3

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,840
months of joining the project I had

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,030
taken over several packages was

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,400
maintaining different pieces of software

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,760
had built the first server that was

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,650
fully dedicated for Debian use and had

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,220
become sort of very involved in the

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:05,100
center of the project that was in late

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,370
1994 something about me that people

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,550
don't know

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,260
well okay today I've done lots of things

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,880
in the project those of you who know me

00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,040
will recall that I was Debian project

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,450
leader at one point I spent almost 10

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,430
years as chairman of the Debian

00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,680
Technical Committee and I've been

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,170
involved in all sorts of craziness over

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,360
the years in terms of architecture for

00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:28,720
our infrastructure in the project and

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:33,400
and some other things big decisions over

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,410
the years today I'm actually retired in

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,390
the corporate world and the things I

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,150
still do for Debian are to maintain a

00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,970
few base essential packages things like

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:46,060
gzip and tar and sudio which I've been

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,950
working on fixing some bugs in today and

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,370
something that people don't know about

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,760
me

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,250
boy that's actually many people have

00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,990
been immensely surprised that given the

00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,790
amount of travel I did during my

00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,950
corporate career this is the first time

00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,090
I've ever been in Taiwan so there's

00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:09,730
something most people don't know about

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:12,220
me so I just heard over the record you

00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,950
and Zubrin your own company that develop

00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,790
hardware for rocketry do people here

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,820
know about it

00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,740
yeah actually almost you jump in mates

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,060
about that but for those who don't and

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,590
those who are watching on the video

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,900
stream

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,060
Keith Packard and I are partners in a

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,160
small company that does open hardware

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,990
and open-source solutions for the

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,050
electronics that are used in high-power

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,990
model rockets which is a hobby thing

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,120
I've also personally built electronics

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,210
that's now on satellites that are in

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,160
orbit and lots of other stuff like that

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,590
but yeah that's enough about me other

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:52,240
folks sure I have things to say okay

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:56,350
thank you I so to answer the question

00:07:52,240 --> 00:08:03,160
now I get in Berlin's project how do you

00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:05,860
static with Debian at quite Beauty life

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,520
15 years ago when I was living in Paris

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,890
and after that when I moved overseas in

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,040
a little island I began to manage to

00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:17,050
much time in front of me and I could

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,300
finally use that time to do something

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,780
constructive about the tools are was

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,870
like to

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:29,130
using that's where our tips that made me

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:34,719
some free feed me some time actually to

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:37,120
contribute and and posting guys I met

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,599
because I was not in the computer world

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:47,200
actually was 212 the translation project

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:49,120
to to add people who don't speak English

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,930
very well that like me as you can see

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,440
you to actually we are able to instead

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:58,690
software understands documentation and

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,980
that's that's what drove means the

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:06,040
beginning and once you get in volume if

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:08,830
you happy with the project you you do

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:13,660
more and that's how I came involved that

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:15,940
project and say someone some things

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:19,720
that's people might not know about me

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,340
and pretty odd I don't know maybe maybe

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:30,220
you don't know but I am very much like

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:32,140
rabbits so my debian story and how I got

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,960
there is was a long and twisty road so

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,740
I'll try to make a short version of it

00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,660
but in 2000 when I finished high school

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,890
my family wasn't doing so well so there

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,680
wasn't a way for me to go to university

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,750
so I just continued supporting a bunch

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,230
of IT work around the neighborhood and a

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,120
few companies that knew at this stage I

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,339
discovered Linux and played with it more

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,050
and more and found that I can do a lot

00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:58,540
of things that I did with Windows

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,470
service just with Linux just installing

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,180
apache and samba already blew my mind so

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,640
I started doing this for all the

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,070
companies I supported already and found

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,710
that it was great and I thought I should

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:14,050
really get Linux into schools and teach

00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,120
other high school kids how to use Linux

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,710
now to administer it so at this point I

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,230
was posted about it on a Linux user

00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,420
group and at this point the shuttle

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,780
foundation who was also on that Linux

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,420
user group and was talking about getting

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,980
thin lines into schools for educational

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,470
purposes I thought that this is great I

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,550
should get in touch and because I could

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,940
piggyback on that

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,769
Linux in schools and so year later I

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,260
started working for them full-time and

00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:43,200
it it's now building to a lot of things

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:48,910
I became a winter contributor and

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:51,310
lighter on MIT and by 2012 I joined my

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,980
first debconf and then things now build

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:56,560
into the debian direction from there on

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,240
so yeah and last year I finally became a

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,399
Debian developer so that's that's it in

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,220
a nutshell something that someone might

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:07,350
not know about me I'm a big Star Trek

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,350
fan that's all I can think of right now

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:21,730
I was I started do you use Linux as a

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:27,790
system as an accelerator in small

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:33,220
company and because there's no money so

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:39,300
I should use Linux food proxy with DNS

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:43,000
were web server and the other people and

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:48,490
Debian people in Linux users local user

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:55,410
group so I choose Debian for the Fosters

00:11:48,490 --> 00:12:03,100
and I asked many questions to local

00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:07,829
mailing list then I thought I want the

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:14,230
answer from the reliable people there

00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:19,140
what should I do for it then and I I

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:25,120
thought if I am kind of a contributor

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:28,089
they they probably don't ignore me if

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,920
there are the people and just a user and

00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:35,050
contributor probably they choose the

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,640
questions from the contributors I

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:42,000
thought so I started to walk in about

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,300
[Music]

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,930
translation work

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:52,310
because I'm not good at English so I

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:56,540
don't read much English at KU so I

00:12:52,310 --> 00:13:01,160
studied to the translation difficult

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:06,460
message from English to Japanese that

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:12,500
stat that stat of my Libyan contribution

00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:14,030
recently proved in some packages like

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,440
able to strap

00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:23,990
how many uses the boot throught oh thank

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:28,310
you and fix bags and make some

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:30,380
regressions and some people angry with

00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:38,600
me okay

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:43,570
why when you update these packages but

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:50,350
it's a fun time - for me - to get some

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:50,350
reaction from the users that's all

00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,550
well my first approach with Debian was

00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,470
in the university with the compilers

00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,780
course for some reason was a requirement

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,840
to install Debian to run some Java

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:05,660
thanks sir - so I install it and I

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,450
really like it then I went to that code

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:12,230
2012 and I really love the community it

00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:14,600
was like oh I need to be part of this so

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:18,500
I started to contribute maybe two months

00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:22,760
after that calm and then I become additi

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,980
two years ago actually yeah and one of

00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,690
the most things I like is I started

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:33,410
contributing with the Debian Astra team

00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:35,540
which I am kind of astronomy fan so I'm

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:39,400
kind of contributing with a lot of

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:42,410
people and in the Astronomy community

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:46,180
one thing you don't know about me is

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,180
like I'm coffees bass player

00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:57,809
hi so I started using Linux when I was a

00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:59,669
high school students I was using and -

00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:04,919
back then because like watching

00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:08,369
computation lines scroll by was when I

00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:11,850
started University I became involved in

00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:14,879
the student ISP there and go to service

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:17,339
were running Debian so I started like

00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:21,389
using Debian to understand what was

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:23,639
going on and I guess I had to package

00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:27,829
something and I started getting involved

00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:31,109
in packaging and then infrastructure to

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:34,049
actually submit packages wasn't that

00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:38,730
good so I contributed there and then I

00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:41,189
got root access to the server so

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:44,189
basically yeah you just put your hand in

00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:47,160
a sport coke and then your arm gets

00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:51,720
sucked in and you keep contributing I

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:54,329
guess one thing that people might not

00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:01,980
know about me is that I watch like way

00:15:54,329 --> 00:16:03,929
too many TV shows oh one of the last

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,749
thing that I rewatched was heartened

00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:12,600
catified Horton catch fire

00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:14,399
very good ok so before I move on to the

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,259
next question I just want to ask the

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,289
audience quickly how many of you here

00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,819
and know Debian contributors you want to

00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:22,049
be in the future but you are not yet

00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:29,129
Tippie and contributors could you please

00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:32,089
raise your hand ok good ok so back to

00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:34,499
the next question what is your greatest

00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:37,529
accomplishment or your proudest mom

00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:42,539
moment during your TV antenna I was at

00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:44,999
with Nicola so during my time in Debian

00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:49,259
have contributed to the outreach team

00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:52,649
which runs google Summer of Code and

00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,660
outreach e internships in Debian I think

00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:57,839
the thing that I'm the most proud of is

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,379
making sure that the project keeps

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,569
funding outreach

00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:06,399
internships in a regular manner so that

00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:10,179
people can get involved in the project

00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:13,029
underrepresented groups a question for

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:15,490
you so do you need to be a deviant

00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:18,850
contributor to join the outreach team or

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:25,480
is open for anyone to how like what has

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:28,179
the qualification to be to be so if I

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,039
guess if you have some I'm I'm not

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:33,070
currently involved in the outreach team

00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:36,460
anymore but if you have something that

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,159
you want to be done inside Debian and

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,220
you're not a contributor yet I think

00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:46,059
you're going to be accepted as a mentor

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:49,629
inside the team and actually get like an

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:53,559
internship scrub start to do the project

00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:56,919
that you want to include in Debian it's

00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:59,919
way easier if you're already maybe known

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:04,179
in the community but it's not strong

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:07,929
requirement and of course if you want to

00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:16,330
do an internship then yeah new new

00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:19,090
contributors are of course welcome well

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,830
my one of the things I'm proudest the

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,860
packaging of newbies which is a data

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:28,480
analysis tool which and I make helps to

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:31,179
analyze astronomical data so it took me

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,399
like a packaging a lot of stuff to to

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:35,679
bring all the stack to Debian and I

00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:37,899
really like that but actually I really

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,360
enjoy every time I cross a park because

00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:43,179
I know there's a lot of people is

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:49,029
relying in Debian packages so I'm just

00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:52,539
there to help them on the back so do you

00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:55,299
remember any like very difficult bulk in

00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:59,009
how much time did you spend on yeah the

00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:59,009
hardest bug in your life so far

00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:08,840
there'll be plenty probably once with

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,690
ISBN which is not related with

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,169
yeah but this really her packaging is

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:17,480
there yeah yeah it's really hard to keep

00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:31,279
it building in a lot of architecture so

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:32,720
that's one of maybe two weeks yeah it's

00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:40,220
a we leave some time at the end for

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:46,129
questions we only have two so as I said

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:48,950
I'm Czech writer so I am writing the

00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:55,360
Debian article in Japanese tech magazine

00:19:48,950 --> 00:20:00,340
for five years so I read the davia

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:04,639
information along the people in Japan

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:06,470
okay so I have a question about when

00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:09,789
people talk about Japan they always talk

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:14,659
about the Japanese manga it's really yes

00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:24,259
people because my Nick is the picture

00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:27,619
the Japanese manga character there was

00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:30,499
there we will do manga I know I know

00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:36,049
they're also because I'm the I am also

00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:40,779
the Ubuntu local Japan team but the

00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:46,759
magazine was suspended because of the

00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:53,450
company should it sits nice if I can see

00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:58,129
the leader the deviant peope Debian

00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:01,789
manga and the better I saw some hacker

00:20:58,129 --> 00:21:07,909
comic in Japan and the character uses

00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:11,690
Debian Oh thatís where is he he uses

00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:13,909
Tavian I guess okay so another question

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,889
for you so you said that I'm new new out

00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:17,090
writer for local magazine

00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:18,460
someone who's really a very traditional

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,550
media

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,830
that could have to in send out the

00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:26,980
message to the public and they're more

00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,580
tech writer like you in Japan about TV

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,660
and anyone

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,220
are there more tech writers like you

00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,470
about TV n or do you have any plan that

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:43,840
how to to get more people to become

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:48,880
writer there's a lot of money

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:52,150
I know it any incentive did you get paid

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:57,190
by writing for the magazine yes I got

00:21:52,150 --> 00:22:06,430
but it's not so much I spent every

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:10,450
weekend and but the daytime is not so

00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:15,790
much because probably you know the check

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:21,460
the check the tech issue is so hard to

00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:24,460
do the produce over to to use the

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:32,080
correct word check the chicken the craft

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:35,700
bodies had and it's I I want more people

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:40,270
to get involved to light about Debian

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:47,170
but if you want more money I don't I

00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:50,320
don't it's not money issue it's a kind

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,300
of love so I think the motivation could

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,460
be to have your name on on a printed

00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,990
paper now everything on line but now you

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,610
can open the book open the medicine it's

00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,500
your name right there I think it could

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,970
be a good motivation for people here who

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,970
want to cry about DVM

00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:09,160
so there's a few things that that I was

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,240
proud of in Debian one thing wasn't

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,880
really my fault

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,040
but that was well Def Con 16 went in

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,900
Cape Town which is my home city that was

00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,310
really nice debconf and I still have

00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,770
people telling me oh that was a great

00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,650
Def Con panic I'm glad to but I was just

00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,210
a very small part of it but that's

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:28,540
definitely one thing that stands out for

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:31,120
me but also during the stretch released

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,170
I did a lot of testing on the testing

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,180
images that were available

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,160
filed some bugs and fixed one or two of

00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,720
them as well and that's something I'm

00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,670
really happy with and I'd also suggest

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,630
to anyone who wants to get involved into

00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:45,490
Debian testing the pre-release images is

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:47,080
extremely useful and valuable to the

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,360
project and it's a good way to get

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,060
exposure to many parts of the project as

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,970
well because you learn to file bugs you

00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:59,110
learn to try to reproduce other people's

00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:02,500
bugs so it's a good idea to keep watch

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:04,800
on when alphas and betas are released

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,420
and especially the final images and

00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,320
install something like VirtualBox or q

00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,370
mu on your machine and learn to install

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,930
Debian images on Tarun

00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:18,340
that doesn't get you a long way to get

00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:19,930
involved with Debian a question for you

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,630
I'm just curious what is so good about

00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,940
the Def Con in capital I think many

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:35,830
people here haven't been to kept how

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:38,080
people well it was a lot cooler and we

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:42,940
just started today we haven't famous Def

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:45,280
Con yet and lots of places to relax and

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,380
sit around and chat and the social

00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,980
aspect of it was really good and I think

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:53,560
that makes a big difference okay that we

00:24:50,980 --> 00:25:00,310
can tell if this is it not better you

00:24:53,560 --> 00:25:03,910
know we have to wait until the end one

00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:07,830
of the singer I was I've been most happy

00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:10,290
to when I was contributing to Debian was

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:13,030
was the actually the first times the

00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:15,610
first time I wrote a big ripoff that was

00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:17,680
Tony acknowledged by cement now the

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,380
first time I proposed a patch that was

00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,410
accepted by smanos first time I made my

00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:26,200
own applause first time I met actually

00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:27,730
Debian developer in real life that has

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,790
set of the things that made me

00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:33,450
personally happy and for the things that

00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:35,650
I'm most proud of that might be the

00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:40,780
people around me that are now using

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:43,440
Debian just because showing them there's

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,990
something that works it is

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,090
you know interesting that that my Soviet

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:51,150
problem and and so there are these

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:54,390
people around me or of course our way

00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,920
but I know I contributed for them to

00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,940
actually use DePiano

00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,560
ogre persona that that makes me proud to

00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,150
be in the projects of that I think that

00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,460
it's very important to get people around

00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:07,230
you to use VPN another question for you

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,510
so you're a high school teacher

00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,830
do all your student news Debian sorry

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:14,880
your student do they owe you

00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:17,280
actually uh we at the school look when

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,640
I'm where I'm currently we we don't use

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,890
debian on on the computer but a few

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,990
years ago I managed to because I'm

00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:29,490
teaching mechanical engineering and some

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:32,820
of this software and learning and UNIX

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:35,100
bias Basque computer but she gets a

00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:39,720
grant managed to to teach some computer

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:44,040
science so I was able to instant my own

00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:46,110
servers instead was actually clients so

00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,000
I run the B&E dude that's why I got

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:53,220
involved in the Debian a new project at

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,320
the time and yes there was more than one

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,390
room that is that was running the me on

00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:01,740
that is still running Debian actually in

00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:05,100
not nee and at least one of the students

00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:09,450
are finding where after humans came back

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,560
and and showed me is computer me I know

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,670
it's running them again and now it's

00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:17,060
running so yes that works okay so but I

00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:19,230
think you know I have a story of one

00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,450
oscillation member who is also a high

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:24,240
school teacher so being a teacher give

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:25,890
you a lot of opportunity you can just do

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,540
anything you want even though there is a

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,520
lesson plan that you need to follow but

00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,250
you can get the student together one

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,170
evening and try to do something actually

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,150
that yet that lead them into one

00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,960
direction so I think that being a

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,490
teacher is a really cool position they

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,410
do have the impact in the young

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,840
generation so thank you very much and

00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:48,020
helping you continue to dish DPN to more

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,020
people

00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:54,370
well the things I'm proud of it's really

00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:58,510
hard to winnow that down to just one so

00:27:54,370 --> 00:28:01,300
I wanted I'll mention three one of them

00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,970
is that because my corporate

00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,670
professional career caused me to travel

00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:08,260
an immense amount around the world many

00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:10,170
of you who know me know that there were

00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:13,870
several years where I did more than

00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:17,110
400,000 flight miles per year and in

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:19,420
that crazy period one of the things I

00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,890
got to do was to meet people in

00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,140
different countries who were interested

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,150
in Debian but didn't have any way to get

00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,220
their key signed so they could start the

00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,710
process of becoming a Debian developer I

00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:32,410
can think of at least three countries

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,450
where the first didi in that country was

00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,400
able to join the project because I

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,110
visited their country on business and

00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,060
was able to meet them and sign their key

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:43,090
and so that was that's something I

00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,430
thought was really cool at the time the

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:48,190
second thing is that there was a year

00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:50,350
when I was invited to attend the Linux

00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:52,930
kernel summit on behalf of my employer

00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:55,420
to talk about what my employer needed

00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:57,820
from the kernel community and I took

00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:01,210
advantage of that opportunity to rip off

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:04,330
my HP shirt exposing my debian swirl

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:06,700
t-shirt underneath and ask the kernel

00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:08,950
community the question is Debian

00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,440
violating at social contract by shipping

00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,790
the Linux kernel in Maine and that was

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,590
the beginning of the discussion about

00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:17,020
getting all the binary firmware blobs

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:19,120
out of the kernel which took several

00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,010
years of work and the kernel community

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,400
had to buy in and agree to work on that

00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:27,400
that the way we handle firmware for i/o

00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,860
devices around the Linux kernel today I

00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,570
think I think the only reason that work

00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,120
ever got done is that someone like me

00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:36,160
was willing to stand up and in some way

00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,140
sort of embarrassed the kernel community

00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,200
about the issue and get them to take it

00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,970
seriously but I guess on some level the

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,880
thing I'm probably personally the most

00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:48,220
proud of in Debian is that today when

00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,990
people talk about Debian many of the

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,450
things they talk about as being

00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:56,200
significant and important are things

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,580
that I articulated in the second DPO

00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,930
election plan

00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,510
form that I wrote the year that I

00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,770
actually got elected and there are

00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:06,250
things like the importance of

00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:08,890
internationalization the use of the

00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:11,080
universal operating system as a meme for

00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:14,890
the project I'm not the one who came up

00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:17,020
with that phrase but I elevated it in my

00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:19,660
DPL platform that year and it's been

00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,160
around forever and one other stupid

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:24,310
little thing is that when I was the

00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:28,060
Debian project leader I started a habit

00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:30,520
of writing bits from the DPL and where

00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:33,640
the bits thing came from is a very long

00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,860
story but it amuses me now every time I

00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,500
see a status report from some Debian

00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:45,540
team that says bits from because that's

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:47,890
something I introduced to the project I

00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:50,380
totally understand must be very hard for

00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:52,780
you to pick something like in your for

00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,340
24 years of history working in the in

00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,980
the community there are certainly

00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,630
moments that are even more infamous to

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,330
the crowd but they're not necessarily

00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:02,740
things I'm proud of so I know the

00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:05,170
audience will have more question for you

00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,600
but I have a life of the topics question

00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:09,160
a little bit so you say that you travel

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,730
so much but this is your first time in

00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:14,470
in Taiwan do you have any goal that you

00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,980
want to achieve join industry for

00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:19,810
getting partner for the Rockets three

00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,670
companies or something that you you want

00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:26,320
to achieve right now I'm just trying not

00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:28,930
to melt after that actually I'm very

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,970
excited to be here because I've had lots

00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,070
of business relationships over the years

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,860
with companies in Taiwan and I don't

00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:38,020
actually know I can't really understand

00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,450
how it is that I never had a reason to

00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,250
travel here but it's been very

00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,870
interesting already and I'm looking

00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,740
forward to some of the things we'll see

00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:51,310
on the day trips and so on so thank you

00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,880
okay so let's move on to the next

00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:56,150
question

00:31:51,880 --> 00:32:00,650
yeah what do you see as coloring

00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:04,100
in the community and do you have any

00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:08,570
idea suggestion for speck better scaling

00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:13,070
and sustainability who would like to

00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:18,470
start with you can decide I guess I can

00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:23,390
start I think what I see in the

00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:25,880
community is gradually more diversity in

00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:31,220
the people that are represented inside

00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:33,529
the community and I think this is like

00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,480
really critical for the long-term

00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:38,600
sustainability of the project having

00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:43,730
like people from different backgrounds

00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:46,820
from different viewpoints I think the

00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:50,510
days where the average Debian developer

00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:55,070
was thirty what your own Western male

00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:59,720
are getting over and I think that's good

00:32:55,070 --> 00:33:01,460
so I hope this trend continues before it

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,770
just to ask you I just want to help you

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:07,130
a bit here so you the question you are

00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:09,620
an organizer of this Def Con so is there

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,140
anything that the audience can help you

00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:15,230
during this quick or anything that you

00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,029
want asked to have for upcoming so if

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,700
you are sticking around for the

00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:22,370
conference please go to the DEF CON

00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:25,159
website click on the volunteer link on

00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:27,260
the top of the website and sign up for

00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:31,010
some shifts and we'd be very grateful

00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:33,110
for you IOT shy of my suit so please go

00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,970
look on the volunteer eight-day space do

00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,970
you need more people to support yes

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,929
can you repeat the question please

00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:43,549
okay so what are the current challenges

00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:45,919
that you see in the community and you

00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:48,140
have any ideas are trying to overcome

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,360
future okay one of the big challenges

00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,630
because I have noticed with the people

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,620
that are mean what Amana is like

00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,350
probably is really hard

00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,179
technically maybe to get to any comers

00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:01,279
they're contributing in Debian so

00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:03,590
probably we need better infrastructure

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,960
or better tools to to get these people

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,570
to get easier to contribute because

00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,690
sometimes you have to

00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:12,580
like shaving a lot of stuff so that's

00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,160
that's the challenge I see in the

00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:18,400
community maybe we we need more more

00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,730
tools to get contributors easy and maybe

00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:25,420
now we are using it laughs in salsa so

00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:29,980
maybe we'll help better to get people to

00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:32,350
contribute with just so and how big it

00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:36,520
deviant community there in Guatemala do

00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:38,680
you know well we know why it was a very

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,200
big community but the people start to

00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:44,710
work or having family now right now is

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,380
we have we are 2d T's there but I'm the

00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:50,110
only active one so basically it's just

00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,330
me so do you meet up from time to time

00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:56,320
or how do you get connect with other

00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:58,870
people well right now just hire see the

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,550
that's kind of the problem because there

00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:03,220
are dangerous the software industry over

00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:05,050
there is more like private privative

00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,300
software microsoft is pushing a lot into

00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:10,210
universities so people it's not using

00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,940
Linux at all so it's really really hard

00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:14,650
to compare combines people to show them

00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,670
because they are like Oh money money or

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:20,920
something like that so they are not

00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:23,410
contributing for profession or something

00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,880
like yeah it's the same question we have

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:28,620
in Asia but maybe the audience could

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,620
have could help us later on

00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:44,770
the challenge the people should share

00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:49,350
the current status of each other it it

00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:56,580
probably the becomes that chance for the

00:35:49,350 --> 00:36:01,300
contribution people should should not

00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:06,610
shout about the idea of the not a

00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:10,420
package name talk about the current

00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:12,670
program of the the package or

00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:20,020
translational website

00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:29,680
event were and talk about anything

00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:35,770
the current stages and another challenge

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:41,710
is is many in Japan many younger people

00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:55,570
says I choose cool Debbie is not so we

00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:58,270
should make Vivian cool again so I could

00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:00,400
talk all day about challenges but one

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,320
thing that I noticed I was I was in

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,480
wonder two weeks ago upgrading a

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,280
computer lab they and all the young

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,770
people they only use their phones and

00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,960
tablets and this is the primary computer

00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,550
that they use and I've spoken to some

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,350
locals in Taiwan and I say the same

00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,930
thing is happening here and if you're

00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:18,790
using Android then as your primary

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:20,710
operating system then it's basically a

00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:23,830
consumer device so you don't use your

00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:25,600
device to create and to make things you

00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:28,090
just consume content you watch videos

00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,640
you download games and that's what your

00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:32,740
computer is about so I think in the

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,580
larger free software community we have a

00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:38,920
challenge to to try to make mobile

00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:41,740
devices better for creating things and

00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,630
at least on Android you get after it now

00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,610
which is pretty cool it's a it's like

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,740
Google Play but only contains free

00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:49,240
software and it's easy enough to use so

00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,520
that I can tell family and friends to

00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,290
install it and I can figure out how to

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,480
install the apps from the ourselves

00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:58,240
without any further involvement from my

00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,640
party but there's a lot of things that's

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,340
still difficult like just getting a good

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:07,420
Python environment on an Android device

00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:11,440
is quite difficult and I think projects

00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,030
like the libram 5 which is a foreign

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,840
made by purism that will basically run

00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:19,750
Debian will be great for many people who

00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,440
use a phone is a primary device and if

00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:25,210
that can at least support some level of

00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,760
Android app compatibility then that will

00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:30,340
open up

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:33,050
use world for people so I hope that as

00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:35,090
because it's it's a pity for me that

00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:36,830
we're a universal operating system but

00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,690
we don't run under the most popular kind

00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,980
of computer that people have these days

00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:42,380
so it feels like something that really

00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,970
should be so somehow or another I don't

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,830
think there's any easy solution for it

00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:49,150
yet but I think it's something we can

00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:52,270
think about and talk about more often

00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,270
thank you

00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:59,620
once that silence the change is what I'm

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,020
seeking up is on the human level

00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,920
sometimes we are a group of people when

00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,680
we see it rizona

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,630
you can work but sometimes when when

00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,950
owned in remote places we we only

00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:15,920
addressed which was not be a mailing

00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:17,930
list or ILC and we come from yeah I use

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,010
different places where I used to concur

00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:24,980
chance and sometimes we forget it and we

00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:28,970
assume but why is this person not

00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:32,050
thinking like me and sometimes we we

00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:34,910
begin to fight with each other and it's

00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:36,980
it's not always right but when we see

00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:39,430
chosen in real life like you know this

00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:42,020
kind of event we we remember that

00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:44,110
everyone around me is it's actually nice

00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:47,390
and I can have a real discussion and

00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:57,290
sometimes just based on the misses just

00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:59,600
ending and and we we lose it so not so

00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:02,930
much has helped us remember and papers

00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:05,600
remember we are a diverse diverse

00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:09,140
community and and remember that we were

00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,820
you man you know that's one of the

00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:14,180
challenges I think well sometimes

00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:19,790
fighting against him we can't we can

00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:21,260
improve and do better I help so it's

00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:24,320
sort of interesting being from the

00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:26,390
United States I sometimes think that the

00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,570
free software community in my country is

00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:31,700
disadvantaged in a way because so many

00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:34,430
of the large proprietary software

00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:37,050
companies are based in the US and this

00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:40,440
leads to a real

00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:43,710
inertia problem in industry and in the

00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,780
government who do things that are really

00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:48,600
in favor of free and open-source

00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:51,150
software I also think sometimes we are

00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,430
handicapped by the fact that English is

00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,700
our primary language and English has

00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:59,460
this sort of horrible problem that the

00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:02,610
word free has multiple definitions and

00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:05,580
so when we talk about free software the

00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:09,120
difference between gratis and Libre is

00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:11,580
hard to explain to people and this led

00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,210
to the whole creation of the term

00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,760
open-source is a sort of alias but not

00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:20,100
really for free software and it's led to

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,350
a lot of discussion a lot of confusion

00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,820
over time and when I think about you

00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,410
know what would it take to make Debian

00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,080
cool again and what would it take to

00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:30,690
cause Debian to show up on all the

00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,940
mobile devices in the world I think in

00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:35,130
order to get there you know we have to

00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,890
somehow figure out how to make sure that

00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:41,430
our mission and our messages and the

00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:44,040
things that we're focusing on stay fresh

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:46,050
without losing sight of the original

00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,870
sort of fundamental set of objectives

00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:50,760
that the people who started and put a

00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:53,250
lot of early energy into this project

00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,530
cared about and if you go back and read

00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,810
the Debian manifesto or if you look at

00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:59,730
the social contract or you think about

00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:02,430
the free software foundations for

00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:04,740
freedoms all of those things are even

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:07,200
more important today than they ever have

00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,970
been in the past and yet it's really

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,220
really easy for some of those

00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:13,950
fundamental values to get lost in the

00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,390
noise because there's so much going on

00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,410
and so many things that we're all

00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:20,400
talking about

00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:23,520
and so I worried that somehow with so

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,710
much stuff being worked on that we have

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,870
so many things to talk about that we

00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,970
forget sometimes the importance of

00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:32,460
focusing on some of those core original

00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:34,500
values which are still I believe a

00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,960
really significant part of why Debian

00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:40,590
can and should and must continue to

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,200
exist thank you very much so I just want

00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:45,480
to do a quick sum up about the ideas

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,210
about I have here to overcome the

00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,240
challenges so diversity is a good thing

00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,560
to get like

00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,300
and after more people join your

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,570
community and then we talk about the

00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:58,630
tool that has developed both engaged to

00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:00,970
work with the project and also how to

00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,260
motivate people yeah different way

00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:04,660
different suggested not only about money

00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:06,640
but you know that it's not direct money

00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,740
but people could be motivate in a way to

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,630
work in the project and it led to more

00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:13,600
opportunity for them in the future today

00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:15,850
something that we can go around I send

00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:21,970
out message and then we have something

00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:24,460
to create a environment where people can

00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:28,150
meet more often face of a discussion is

00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:32,560
always good and then we want DPN to run

00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:34,780
on more mobile devices and what I have

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,790
here so then finally we have better

00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,220
talking about whatever we do we need to

00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:43,750
have a clear vision and we need to do

00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:46,180
focus on our core values not like to too

00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:48,100
many different project and finally just

00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,500
one last question before we open up the

00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:55,680
floor to the audience if you could

00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:55,680
change one thing what what would that be

00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:11,680
yeah just one okay so if it to do it

00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,240
doesn't matter if it's too difficult to

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,340
answer the question then I would like to

00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:20,200
open the floor to to the audience we

00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:23,220
have a thick minutes for you to interact

00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,220
with the panelists

00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,800
hello when your ass the question was was

00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,930
the most difficult

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,780
 you fix time I do not remember but

00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:41,500
I remember the most difficult part I was

00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:45,530
able to put on somebody else which was a

00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:47,420
student and he took two weeks for this

00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:49,100
but if it was really cool I probably

00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,780
would have taken longer and she's

00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,420
reported on the DEP confer on it and I

00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:55,820
think it's more spreading the workload

00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:58,010
to two young people is also something I

00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:07,490
remember more likely than maybe other

00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:13,610
things I needed to fix in any other

00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:15,320
question or some idea so how do you can

00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,730
reach out to to more people like

00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,220
Guatemala if people young people

00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:20,900
nowadays care about having a good job in

00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:23,120
earn more money so how do we motivate

00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:26,770
them to contribute into a phase of web

00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,770
project any idea

00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:47,210
not a very big idea it's just sometimes

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,060
uh needs are very very local and very

00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:52,970
very specific to the people involved so

00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:55,460
I remember hearing a story about getting

00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:57,859
grandmother's learning grandmother's

00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:01,490
learning how to code motivated by their

00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:04,340
need to have access to photos of their

00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:06,680
families who are far away so it was just

00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:09,650
photo management and so they were

00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:12,590
motivated to do that this is just a

00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:15,740
little thing that I think it exposes a

00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:20,080
principle of solving the need presented

00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:20,080
by the people who you're trying to help

00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:38,350
maybe ideas to attract people before

00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:42,240
they are and at the age that they need

00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:47,790
money because if you talk to two kids

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:50,800
they it's usually easier to relate to

00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:53,680
express them our values and why we think

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,050
free software is important and since

00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:00,730
they don't have to think about money yet

00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:04,450
then they can already share some values

00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:08,770
with us because if we wait until they

00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:11,710
are young new professionals then it's

00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:15,490
more difficult yeah I totally agree with

00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:17,680
you so recently I visited a high school

00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:19,390
in Vietnam in Hanoi and I was really

00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,600
surprised that most of the students

00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:24,460
there you are clinics you know most of

00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,960
the people in the university when

00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,250
University didn't I say they all year's

00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,470
window but I didn't went to high school

00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:31,990
they actually started to you Lee knows

00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:33,790
already at a very young age so it's a

00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:35,920
very good suggestion to reach out to

00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:38,170
younger generation and it's the job of

00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,360
teacher are you so more people should

00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:43,000
become teacher and bring free software

00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:47,800
idea into into school or even your kids

00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,570
embrace you have kids right okay so I

00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,130
saw a future and here I hope they all

00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:55,180
become deviant contributors in the

00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:59,310
future any more question for our

00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:59,310
panelists over here please

00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:09,610
- to the previous question about what

00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:12,190
can we do to sort of bridge the goals of

00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:15,370
financial incentive and and also helping

00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:17,620
the community that actually had our

00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:19,900
company Hudson River trading we do

00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:24,100
summer internships for college students

00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:28,440
and this year what we did was just paid

00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:30,850
college students to fix open source bugs

00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,520
so now they get a feather in their cap

00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:36,640
for the resume they get some experience

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,860
maybe we hire them to do general purpose

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,080
development but at the same time give

00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,730
back you know to the community to the

00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:46,119
people

00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:53,500
for some things that were requested in

00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:56,290
the first place I think the main

00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:58,480
challenge in like bringing new people

00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:03,310
inside the beyond is that we have a

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:06,580
strong culture of scratching on each so

00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:09,160
basically we welcome people that want

00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:15,220
that have an issue and want to fix it

00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:18,580
inside the project we starting to shift

00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:22,900
towards having a few lists of things

00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:27,369
that people could do but we don't really

00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:30,849
have time to do but this is like very

00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:33,160
very marginal part of the project as the

00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:36,250
for instance in the tracking system

00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:39,520
there's a newcomer tag that maintenance

00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:44,680
can use to mark bugs as being fixable

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:47,920
and by newcomers basically they are

00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:52,830
offering mentorship to get the bugs

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:57,400
fixed but this is really very very tiny

00:49:52,830 --> 00:50:00,670
part of the issues that the project has

00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:04,240
and it's been a challenge for a few

00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:09,040
years to get actual internship subjects

00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:10,660
for the outreach team I don't know how

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,730
to fix it

00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,470
mentorship actually I have a question

00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:16,690
about how do you practice mentorship

00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:18,820
here in deviant community I know that

00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:20,920
Jonathan wrote an article about you got

00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:24,670
your boss to be a very good mentor in

00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:27,760
the beginning so how is it here so I

00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:31,720
think the main the main area where does

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:34,720
mentorship in Debian is packaging we

00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:38,880
have a few processes that are in place

00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:40,369
to actually get people to

00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,839
[Music]

00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:46,349
well-maintained new packages or update

00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:48,420
existing packages I think there's some

00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:50,760
initiatives around Debian science as

00:50:48,420 --> 00:51:17,599
well mentorship of the months is that

00:50:50,760 --> 00:51:19,910
still running it's okay

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,470
so let's talk from the beginning Polly

00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:25,369
we are doing this is mentoring of

00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:28,049
cements and I get three to four people

00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:31,950
finishing one package per year so

00:51:28,049 --> 00:51:34,079
starting from scratch and to ready

00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:36,900
package and it's frequently these are

00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,880
upstream developers who learn packaging

00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,970
and then there are most competent people

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:45,059
where more than ten we ourselves and

00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:46,890
this is I've really tried to propagate

00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:56,609
this because other teams could do this

00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:59,010
as well any other question so we have

00:51:56,609 --> 00:52:02,190
time for one more question I totally

00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:04,950
agree that the venue's more young people

00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:08,160
to join so I am here I'm just

00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:13,079
challenging when given control rules

00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:18,359
that encourage diversity people to join

00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:23,579
their comm over 35 years old that rule

00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:26,819
needs to change to add one rule if the

00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:31,490
director people under 35 years it's also

00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:31,490
welcome yes you yeah you're right

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,500
okay everyone so we have come to the end

00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:42,650
of our panel please a big applause for

00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,650
