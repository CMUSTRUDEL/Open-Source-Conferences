The lightweight classic desktop environment LXDE has been developed for 12 years and remains one of the best choices for less powerful hardware.

In 2013, the LXDE project teamed up with the Razor-Qt project and initiated LXQt desktop together. This is a historic event in FOSS since most of the time we saw forks rather than merges. It's especially true for desktop environments. In this session, we will talk about the past and future of LXDE/LXQt and share what we have learned during the journey.

	00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:13,400
let's start another talk after a coffee

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,410
break and the stage is yours okay okay

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,930
can you hear me

00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:21,259
okay and thank you for coming to this

00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,960
session because you know you know world

00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:26,660
full of mobile phones and cloud services

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,310
actually a few people are interested in

00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,430
these type of environments so really

00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,649
thank you for coming and my name is Omri

00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,899
and people used to call me PC man

00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:38,000
because that's my nickname and now we

00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:41,210
are going to talk about old-fashioned

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,429
desktop environments and that are still

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:50,210
useful yeah okay and so introduction Who

00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:53,750
am I I'm the creator of the OSD desktop

00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:56,719
environment and also and one of the main

00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:01,190
developers of the new LSD I was cute

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:04,760
desktop environment project and I Louis

00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:09,320
user especially Debian Linux since 2004

00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:13,610
and ball and now I'm working for an AI

00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,550
start startup company named up here in

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,290
Taiwan so but and previously I was a

00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,240
physician working in a hospital for six

00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,240
year but I love software so then I

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:28,610
changed my dealer switch for my career

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:31,280
and now I'm here so yeah okay so what

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,370
what's LSD some of you might have heard

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,050
of this testing environment but some of

00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:41,660
you may not so familiar with it LSD

00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:44,120
stands for live way x11 test our

00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,460
environment and it used to be the

00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,400
default desktop environment ship with

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:53,240
raspberry pi but now they use their own

00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,490
desktop but their own data is actually a

00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,510
derivative of our Stevie so we can say

00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,040
they still use our desktop and also it's

00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:05,570
the default desktop environment of

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:09,739
Ubuntu distribution and the project was

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:12,410
born in 2006 and actually is the

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,930
project's point here in Taiwan and but

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,970
few people know that ya then and that

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,500
these design philosophy and of this

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,290
project why we

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,480
we start such a project in 2006 because

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,850
there are already many desktop

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,800
environment but why another that's our

00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,440
environment because we have some

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,500
different design philosophy for example

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,709
we want the system to have low memory

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:41,390
footprint and it has minimalistic design

00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:43,940
and also its gtk+ based and but the most

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:47,330
different thing is the whole desktop

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:50,090
environment is loosely coupled and they

00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,310
are loose coupling between the different

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,620
components and its module that means

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,959
most of the component in the desktop

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,870
environment can be used outside the

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,060
desktop environment so that does a big

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,220
difference with others but some people

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,230
may argue that you you just put a bunch

00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,570
of independent program together and call

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,489
your desta environment if is if they are

00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,980
not so integrated why is code at that

00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,620
time the environment but but we want to

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:19,910
challenge this kind of view but actually

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:22,670
actually it internal that the project

00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:25,880
went pretty well previously and and this

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:28,130
also showed that Conway's law is

00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,860
somewhat correct and that the software

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,260
just the the organization of the

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,170
software system will be will be

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,400
reflected by the the organization

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,950
structure of the organization that

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,370
developed the software yep so we are a

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,160
bunch of loosely coupled volunteers

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:49,239
without a central centralized

00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,890
organization or any company behind us

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,870
yep

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,570
so it's looked like this streamline

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,170
old-fashioned but I prefer the term

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:06,500
classic it's not old it's just classic

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:07,750
yeah so simple and fast and yeah just

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,630
like Unix

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:15,530
ok but during the years it has been

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:19,609
there for 12 years and we've currently

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,870
faced many challenges for example in a

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:26,539
world full of mobile devices actually

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,599
desktop now desktop and laptops naw who

00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:31,800
has less than half monkey sure and and

00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:34,590
also as you know most of the

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,009
are actually Iranian windows and and and

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:41,520
in the small fraction that long Venus

00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:45,659
only a very very small version using our

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,810
desktop environment so and also the

00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:50,729
impair is not as huge as before and also

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,220
we suffer from fragmentation of the

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:56,190
technical stack for example KD and Cano

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,400
are two very different very different

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,710
camps and also some are more

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,099
mobile-friendly and some are more

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:08,759
desktop centric and also we have X 11

00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:11,219
Weyland 3 TK 2 to the K 3 and tricking

00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,139
for is is going to be released I think

00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:17,039
it's going to be released in the near

00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:19,909
future and we have queued for 5 qwidget

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,379
and qml a lot of different toolkits to

00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,270
support and also we have a lot of

00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:27,629
different Linux distribution and this

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:30,210
PHP PSD flavours so you have to make

00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:32,370
sure your code work for all these kind

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:36,539
of combination it's getting more and

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,759
more difficult and and also given the

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,919
technical difficulty and technical

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,590
fragmentations and the small market sure

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,719
it's actually more and more difficult to

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,770
get new developers to build up a new

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:52,319
community and also more slow become a

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,779
problem for us because light weight is

00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,000
being like way it's not as important as

00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:00,000
before because more more slow solve the

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,849
problem it's not not us to solve the

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,029
problem it's the most most low so so

00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:10,169
actually you can come that my desktop

00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:11,849
only need one 100 megabyte of RAM but

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:16,940
that doesn't matter because your browser

00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:19,560
need to 2 gigabytes so so this this is

00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,690
this used to be the problem

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,099
we are we were solving in the past but

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:29,659
it cannot be the only focus for our

00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,659
project right now yeah

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,790
it is still very important for in

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,960
business and like yeah MIPS or yes or

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,870
Raspberry Pi for those kind of stuff so

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,340
yeah it is values thank you for

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:53,220
mentioning this that's why we are still

00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:56,430
alive yes but another unfortunate trend

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,610
is if you type this into the Google

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:05,460
search trend will find that gtk+ we as

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:08,460
cute actually gtk+ is less people are

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:12,090
interested in gtk+ nowadays and the

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:14,850
overall trend is just declining so it's

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,710
really not so easy to find new the

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,680
developer for this kind of the

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:24,240
sub-project nowadays so we really need

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:28,949
some changes then we try to address this

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,740
issue in 2013 we we try to pull some

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:37,050
core component too cute try to see how

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:39,330
it works as you might know LSD was gtk+

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,660
place there's our environment but we try

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,849
to pour some of the core components like

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,330
the desktop manager file manager too

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:50,520
cute with with the source code rewritten

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,460
in C++ and of course

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,099
KD developed some of it ke developers

00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:59,130
during the process especially wheels

00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:03,300
difícil we want to thank Kelly developer

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:05,880
for their help so the initial experiment

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,580
showed that actually porting the

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,699
application to cute foreign treat from

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,610
the gtk source code is possible it's not

00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:17,190
easy but it's possible and later we

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,289
found out there there was a another that

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,960
toothpaste desktop environment that sure

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:26,130
the same design principle with us is

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,979
named Reza cute so we started talk to

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:32,400
see if we can collaborate more and later

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:34,020
if we find out the effect is simple we

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,200
have a desktop we want to change the

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,610
cute but we don't have an out of

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,599
engineering resource and they have a

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:45,120
cute codebase but but they they lost the

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:49,740
momentum to continue that

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,899
so then a historic event happened and we

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,149
after some some more collaboration we

00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,059
decide to just merge to project into one

00:08:54,149 --> 00:09:00,149
so we form a new project and else cute

00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:02,579
and this why I say is historic because

00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:05,040
this is rarely seen in their free stuff

00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:08,040
free software community every day you

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,759
see new folks but you you you can hardly

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,819
see successful merges there were merges

00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,970
but most of them failed yeah but but

00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:20,519
armored wear out pretty well so

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:24,809
so actually we proved that it's it's

00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:27,360
possible for a tooth to project with

00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:31,649
totally different tech stack merge

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,600
together yeah so now in the jungle of

00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,839
desktop environment we have a unique

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,019
position yeah because we come from the

00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:43,199
gtk+ world and they came from the cute

00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,939
camp and there was a lot of different

00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:48,300
design environment but now we are

00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:50,339
sitting in the center of this desktop in

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,470
Marin Jung go and try to make everyone

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,110
happy but of course that's very

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:59,009
difficult but but we will try our best

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:03,600
to make sure that we can we can still

00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:07,829
stay with our original ghost but become

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,129
more flexible yeah okay so now of course

00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:17,220
we don't have rescued conf like this but

00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:20,670
I where I visit Paris III I try to find

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,970
our team member there so we had we had a

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:29,999
dinner together yeah you can call that

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:34,170
LSD comes okay so what about the newest

00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:37,379
cute desktop environment and it still it

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:40,889
still has the class UI I mean when I say

00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:44,670
classic it it means windows more windows

00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:48,089
like yeah the the UI that normal people

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:51,120
will want to use yeah and yeah and well

00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:53,910
it become cute paste and we still stay

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,990
with the same design principle as the

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,800
original XD and still being lightweight

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,619
and

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,509
quick response of the UI that's very

00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:06,059
important that's the core value of this

00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:10,079
project it should be very fast even on

00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:13,189
slower machine without such powerful

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:17,160
hardware but of course it's not only for

00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:20,970
the ancient hardware so so I keep

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,009
mentioned classic yeah it is for classic

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,429
best happy environment it's not for oh

00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:28,379
how that will be retires and yeah so

00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:30,839
that's the whole point of this project

00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:32,999
and still we want to make every

00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,399
component modular so they can be used

00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:37,049
outside as cute so even if you don't

00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,149
like the desktop environment you can

00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:42,239
still use the some of the component

00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:45,629
freely without problems such as the file

00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:47,970
manager and archiver image viewer

00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:50,850
something like that and we implement a

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,339
cute platform that made the cute

00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,129
program work better with Linux desktop

00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,699
and that plug-in can actually be used

00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:02,100
outside they are as cute so so other

00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:06,480
cute program cans can also use that and

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:08,639
that's all one of our core value so and

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,319
also we don't force you to use any

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,290
window manager you can choose whatever

00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:16,559
you want and we actually encourage user

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:18,529
to do this but if you ask me my personal

00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,600
recommendation will be open talks but

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:26,309
you can use kwin whatever you want most

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:31,889
of them will work yeah so now it's look

00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:33,949
like this yeah pretty similar to to LSD

00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:35,189
or you can say pretty similar to Windows

00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:37,860
yep

00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:40,470
but there's one thing that makes our

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,259
project pretty unique because you really

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,480
seen you can you can really see a

00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,480
project that use so so many different

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:52,350
technology from totally different

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:55,230
chemists they are because as many people

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:58,769
know that the test back in Linux desktop

00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,829
is quite pretty pretty pretty much in a

00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:04,259
mess and if you are supporting KDE and

00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:06,269
you're also going know you might end up

00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:08,369
using totally different development

00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:11,579
tools library the whole stack will be

00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:12,180
different but we we try to blend them

00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,700
together

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,660
well and and and work with our problem

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,790
so the men graphical user interface is

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,970
implemented using cute

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:26,490
five and four some core assistance

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,010
services we are using Kady Taiwan

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,040
libraries like Kay window system to

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:34,650
interact with the window manager and we

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,380
use k screen to better handle your

00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:39,210
screen screen resolution adjustment

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:44,250
something like that because it's really

00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:46,710
hard to do with RO x cb or or if you

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,690
want to prevail and you'll become very

00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:52,950
difficult so we try to reuse other

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:55,800
people's work and we in some some places

00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:59,220
we use KD solid framework for the howard

00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,980
discovery okay so and about the file

00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:08,360
system abstraction the virtual file

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:12,420
system how to enable application from

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:16,440
using accessing remote file system we

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:20,210
try to use can own file system so we use

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,820
g io kanonji iot Lib Gi Oh and gvfs

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:27,060
because they it's kind of unfortunate

00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,370
that this project has the prefix K or

00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,950
Jeep actually they are desktop

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,260
independent libraries but people when

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,600
people say true they will say no you are

00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,840
using non libraries and know you are

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,960
pulling the KD stack in your desktop but

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,790
no they are just normal library simple

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,550
and independent yeah

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,470
so we mix them together and for the

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,990
window manager apart instead of

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:55,410
developing our own we no manager we

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,240
actually will actually encourage our

00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,580
user to just use their their own

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,690
favorite because there are already too

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:07,320
many window measures yeah and but the

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:10,710
default we will recommend is open box or

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,330
okay wing they work the best but you can

00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,610
choose whatever you want and we have a

00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:18,330
config option for you to change the

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:21,300
window manager easy yep okay and we have

00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,110
a cola brennan q XD g it's a free

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,709
desktop

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:28,769
spec implementation down by our approach

00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:32,100
and this library is actually used by

00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:35,430
some of other similar projects so we use

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:38,939
other's work and our our work is used by

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:40,829
others and this should and this I think

00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:43,709
this is what free software is you like

00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:46,920
should be like and it's now not like you

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:50,490
okay no I am Kady well you do yours I do

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,300
i do my we do ours but things should be

00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,779
it should not be like that

00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:59,369
so we try to mix the good parts from

00:15:54,779 --> 00:16:02,040
different campus and actually we reuse

00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:05,579
some code from different projects of

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:09,329
course the file manager is ported from

00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:11,730
the GDK version of PCM a PCM FM cute

00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:13,139
it's a file manager of course FM means

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,470
file manager and pleasement

00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:18,149
is here so it's actually pretty good to

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,519
start your own project because you can

00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:23,309
end the software after your name just

00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:27,149
like Debian linnaeus yep so it's PC me

00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:30,449
event and it's supported from the

00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:32,490
Giudice version and also we recently we

00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:35,519
have our own file archiver to handle

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:38,730
compressed file and you may be surprised

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,800
that it is implemented using cute but

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,860
actually it's ported from cannon-fire

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,319
roller a totally different UTA program

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,540
but we show that it's possible you can

00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:51,929
you can actually reuse the source code

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,480
that cut the code the library everything

00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,959
from different projects they are not so

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,170
different

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,730
only the UI and user experience should

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,009
be different but the underlying

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:05,760
technology should be sure that's our

00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:07,829
core value and also we provide the

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,100
configuration tool for open Docs and

00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:13,709
even a post audio mixer so it's also

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,860
ported from its already original GTA

00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:19,470
version yeah and also we reuse some code

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,120
from KD as well the terminal emulator

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,220
actually used some code from Katy

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,100
Council and the config

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,640
our config tool used on you I clasp is

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,409
developed by KD yeah and they we mix

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,770
them together and they work pretty well

00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:38,399
without problems actually there were

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,600
some problems some there are still some

00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:43,830
caveats that

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:47,520
to be handled with care for example you

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:50,490
can you can integrate with G lip man

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,760
loop inside cute programs and that is

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:57,450
officially supported by cute but it's

00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,200
buggy and and but most of time it worked

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:04,890
pretty well but if you are trying to

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,690
omitting cute signals within the G up to

00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,330
a signal handles that that will not work

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:13,200
and it's a non non bug for quite a long

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:15,600
time without any fixes so and if you you

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,090
are doing multi web programming and do a

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,929
synchronous i/o with post libraries and

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:24,600
they have slightly different 30 models

00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:27,090
so if you do you are doing multi third a

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,039
synchronous i/o which is the case of

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:31,130
file manager you will be in trouble so

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,940
these need to be handled with care

00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:38,549
otherwise you have some weird bugs and

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:41,039
also in cute there is a environment

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:43,140
variable and then cute note G lip you

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,630
know what it means you can turn off the

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,130
lip integration and if you're a program

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,409
depending on jalebi and the user

00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,020
specified this environment variable your

00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:54,510
application will be broken in some ways

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:58,200
and we actually have some power before

00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:01,140
related to this yeah so so there are

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,730
still some caveats and also and this

00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,070
this one is very interesting when you

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:09,000
are mixing the ste libraries and c plus

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,830
you'll find that in some see libraries

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,840
they will name their variable or

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:19,380
function delete but this is a keyword in

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,440
c++ so so that this disco cannot become

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,090
held together and this really happened

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,510
it happened in the so-called file roller

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:30,450
so so when i'm trying to put that piece

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:33,570
of code a fail to compile until i see

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,820
that although the function is delete and

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:40,740
rename that and it worked beautifully

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:43,650
and also in the source code of julep and

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,650
Gi Oh and there are some there are some

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:51,030
function then like like a variable name

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:52,990
signal but signal is a cute keyword so

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,510
if you are trying to include this

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:58,120
this header file in your cue program you

00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:01,330
have problems so you need to disable the

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,160
the cute macro with some compiler

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,870
definition then this will fix the

00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:11,920
problem and and the other problem is

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:14,050
although cute cute in enable faster

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,559
development for us because the library

00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:20,800
is pretty easy to use troubleshooting

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:22,780
become more difficult yeah because it's

00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,610
the for many different platform and

00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:29,410
source code of queues is pretty

00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:33,460
complicated and from from when migrating

00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:36,750
from q5q five point nine five point

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:40,570
eleven we encounter some regression bugs

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:42,220
frequently and and and in the most of

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:45,250
the time we will receive the bug report

00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:49,270
on our users things like TN d drag and

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:51,940
drop doesn't work or screen resolution

00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,770
went wrong something like that and we

00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,290
will take a look and find out it's not

00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,750
our part and we try to read a cute

00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:02,520
source code and help the option develop

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:05,920
to fix them yeah we do this and

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,380
cooperate with KDE developers and and

00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:15,460
the cute Avella press to get this issue

00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:18,550
fixed ok and another pretty big issue is

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:22,179
it's really very very difficult to have

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,640
a consistent look and feel for your

00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,320
desktop environment because because

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,179
there are too many different you are

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,300
toolkit too many different

00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:35,500
configurations you will have judicata to

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:39,240
adjudicate 3 Q 4 Q 5 and some some pure

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:43,390
x11 programs and they were used maybe

00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:46,170
some use xft settings and you have to

00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:49,230
also support as cursor a lot of things

00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:52,179
otherwise they just look different and

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:54,250
even if you don't subscribe to support

00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:56,800
all of this can on programs do you look

00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,290
different and they are using coincide

00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,950
decoration and you'd have no option to

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:05,200
turn it off so it's pretty hot and we

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,750
try our best to support most of the

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,280
things

00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:13,910
that are coming like funky setting is

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,310
actually not that desktop independent

00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:19,370
not desktop dependent it should be sure

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:21,020
among different application so in our

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,810
configuration tool would try to

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,450
accommodate this incompatibility and try

00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:29,660
to update a setting for different

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:32,120
toolkit properties so they can look more

00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:35,330
or less unified it's not really possible

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:38,930
to make them has similar look and feel

00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:42,200
but we can try our best at least don't

00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:46,070
make them look like aliens yeah but

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:49,130
that's not an easy task and also include

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:52,250
things become more difficult because now

00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,430
cute file rely on some cute platform

00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:59,420
plug-in and each desktop need to develop

00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:01,760
their own plugins to support some better

00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,830
desktop integration and some of the

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,150
features are not provided by cute by

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:10,550
default so so we we try to cultivate our

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,700
own plug-in and to support a better file

00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,140
dialog or better theming things like

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,080
that yep

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,910
but in non gtk handles most of this but

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:26,060
in cute you have to handle this

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:29,420
yourselves ok so what about the final

00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:31,970
result the UI looks mostly the similar

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,820
with the original else TV but people

00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:37,760
will say no no don't use QQ it's bloated

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,550
why why you use cute but actually it's

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,680
not that ok you spoil somewhat

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,990
about it but it's not that voted you can

00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,740
see that the end result we did this

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:51,410
experiment on debian and debian stretch

00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:55,850
the current stable stable version and

00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:58,070
after co put ok the experiment is done

00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,780
in VirtualBox because it's nowadays

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:03,980
really hard to find such a limited

00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:08,690
hardware but I set it to 4 to 2 CPU

00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:11,960
cores and give it 500 megabytes RAM and

00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:15,260
the screen resolution instead to set

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,290
this and then I do coke boot and then

00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,100
open a terminal emulator and t4 file

00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,650
manager

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:25,610
by the desktop because if you don't do

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:28,490
this you're only testing how much room

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:31,610
will be what we need by rendering the

00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:34,700
wallpaper so you need to open some

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,440
application and I just open the default

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,140
file manager for for everyday talking

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,789
Brian but but because open box we know

00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,580
manager that's not Brittany some file

00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:46,520
manager so in in the experiment I did

00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:49,190
not open any app in open box so you can

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,640
see that after Co put if you only login

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:56,990
with purple we know manager open box

00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:00,169
your system will you would the whole

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:06,440
system will take 71 megabytes of RAM and

00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:08,870
if you add a long OSD you will take 104

00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,990
else cute okay I admit that it takes

00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:14,390
more memory but it's not that up that

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:17,630
much compared to the current standard

00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,730
you can see other actually the the

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:23,360
memory usage of the current allocute is

00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:25,789
very similar to that of the SFC so you

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,750
can know that cute is is not really that

00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:31,970
bloated yeah and it's the whole desktop

00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:35,600
environment still used health of the the

00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:38,299
memory usage of KDE plasma but of course

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,360
KD is much more feature-rich so it's

00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:43,070
just trade-off it's not any one of this

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,080
is superior or inferior is just

00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:50,450
trade-off your different design

00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:52,250
philosophy yeah so after all of the

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,900
migration to cute and adding new

00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:58,400
features porting of the code to C++

00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,130
actually the resource usage is very

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:05,840
similar at least on the same scale as

00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:09,830
the original but but after all this we

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,590
got the same UI or no similar UI with

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:16,760
more memory usage and what was the

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:18,320
benefit of doing this yeah I would I

00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,890
would talk about what's the benefit

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,890
later but and also finally Ubuntu is

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,909
going to switching to switch from the

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,240
GDK lost

00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:29,820
LCD to to the new era still cute in the

00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:39,090
up

00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:44,510
release yeah so and sorry I asked you

00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:49,980
this previously oops

00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:53,220
yeah actually by doing this now we have

00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,710
a much more active community because as

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,320
I mentioned previously is now really

00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:03,990
hard to find someone who want to write C

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:06,030
code with gtk+ and especially it's

00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,430
already hard to find someone interested

00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:10,740
in desktop project it's even harder if

00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:13,590
you want to find someone is who is

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:17,100
interesting in desktop but but the guy

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:20,310
is not interested in in KDE or Kunal or

00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:23,700
others and the guy is interested in our

00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,860
desktop environment and then the guy is

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,530
willing to writing C code is to help us

00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,180
the probability is pretty low so it's

00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:33,750
really hard to find new developer but

00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:36,930
with all the new changes new toolkit C++

00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:39,810
and all of the reusing technology from

00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:42,900
using project now we have a quite active

00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:46,650
community and that the core development

00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:49,140
team has about more than 15 developers

00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:51,900
and doing the development actively and

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:55,340
also our community become more active

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:58,470
because of this so I think the stirrer

00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:01,470
and we only increase the memory usage by

00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:07,680
50 50 megabytes I think that's pretty

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:10,860
cheap so after all of this of this hard

00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,500
work I think it is quite worthy because

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,800
now we have a much more healthy

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:20,010
community and the development can can

00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:24,780
still continue it's much more active

00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:31,290
nowadays and also our work can be can be

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:34,610
reused by other acute projects yep so

00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,610
what about the future

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:42,090
the the top one problem is the weight

00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,040
and support because but but when can we

00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,620
have

00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,960
waylynn support is still an open

00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,600
question because it's like chasing a

00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,830
moving target well then is is refuge

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:58,340
changing rapidly and and some of the the

00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:02,030
original free desktop specs are not yet

00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:05,480
designed for Whalen so the the old

00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:07,760
migration will take some time but

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,310
because we are used reusing the kay

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,860
window system library from KDE I think

00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:14,750
you will you will make things much

00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,630
easier because we don't have to do all

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:20,540
these low-level stuff ourselves and we

00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:23,270
can reuse what has been done by other

00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:26,000
projects so that's one of the reason we

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:29,390
introduced library from other project

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,170
and not do it on our own it's pretty

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:35,540
important to not waste the development

00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:40,280
resource to repute the same cool every

00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:43,270
time yeah but and also we are trying to

00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:47,090
improve the user experience yeah because

00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:50,360
it if you have very low memory footprint

00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:53,210
but the user interface is pretty bad it

00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:55,550
doesn't make sense otherwise you can you

00:29:53,210 --> 00:30:00,440
can use terminal emulator it has the

00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:03,350
lowest memory footprint yeah but to make

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,080
a test environment it should have better

00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:08,210
user experience and this is what we we

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,470
did not do pretty well at the moment and

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:14,900
we are trying to improve that so so any

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,910
feedback on this one is really

00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,970
appreciated because we are not driven by

00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:21,830
any company or and we don't have a

00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,200
foundations downtown something like that

00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:29,690
so we don't have our own designers we're

00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:33,770
just a bunch of volunteers so it's it's

00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:37,670
more difficult to get that the same

00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:39,920
level of design like some commercial

00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:43,550
solutions but actually the code base

00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:46,340
itself is good but that you are just not

00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:50,260
look as polished so we should improve

00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:54,620
this part but but we want to keep this

00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:57,080
experience classic that means we are not

00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:00,049
going to hide every man

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:04,039
or we are not going to remove button you

00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:06,499
used to click yeah we will keep the

00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:10,039
classic experience that's the whole

00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:13,190
point of the project and not make

00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:15,409
everything look like mobile phone yeah

00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:18,110
and then we will still make sure the

00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:21,049
project is still that the sub is still

00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:23,690
lightweight and fast and when you click

00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:27,259
any anything you should respond quickly

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:29,840
and that's pretty important and and but

00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:33,499
being like way is still important but

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:37,159
it's not the only focus nowadays thanks

00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:39,739
to Moore's law yeah but but I agree that

00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,779
that is still important for embedded

00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:44,929
systems and also I think it's a very

00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:48,799
good desktop for for devices like

00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:51,440
Raspberry Pi but but I I rarely see

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,749
people using that on pi but but actually

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,659
it works pretty well so if you have a

00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:59,389
Raspberry Pi give it a try please yeah

00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:02,869
and and we are going to do more

00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:06,200
application and make it more polished so

00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:08,840
that's the current plan but there's one

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:13,129
thing I need to curve right here is the

00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:15,489
original LSD is not dead it's still

00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:19,009
being developed and actively maintained

00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:22,039
thanks to our team member yeah because

00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:26,330
the original plan was a full migration

00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:29,299
to acute and and that was cute replaced

00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:32,090
the original I was the desktop but we

00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:34,519
realized that many users still prefer

00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:36,200
the original one and some of the

00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:41,119
developer are still willing to work on

00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:44,299
the old gtk co-pays so now we we keep

00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,159
two different products so while we the

00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:48,590
new the new features are adding to as

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,679
cute LSD is still being actively

00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:54,289
developed just development is not as

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,119
fast as before but it's still being

00:32:54,289 --> 00:33:00,470
develop and maintain and now it's

00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:01,639
judicata three ready so so so if you are

00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,619
still using LSD

00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:07,009
don't worry about that you can you can

00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:09,590
continue using that you will not it will

00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:12,830
not be dead pretty soon

00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:15,169
we'll be unless I think unless gtk is

00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:20,270
self instead as the you will be there

00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:22,900
yeah so so thank you for listening but I

00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:30,650
think we still have some time so let's

00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:34,460
just take a look at some maybe show you

00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:37,789
some of the applications yep

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:46,070
this is the file manager and of course

00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:48,350
is name yeah okay okay maybe we can have

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,090
some Q&A right now do we have some

00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:56,779
questions

00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:58,669
yeah please okay I have two comments and

00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:02,090
the first is just for your reference

00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:05,510
the first one is another successful

00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:10,000
example of Roger merging we saw where is

00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:12,649
that is school in US and the table edu

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,659
okay they merged together because they

00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:18,020
are two in the same same so because I

00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:21,740
have studied for some time okay and the

00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:24,619
second is that actually lightweight

00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:28,399
desktop environment is there are still

00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:31,190
the requirement is always there and what

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:36,169
we are doing now maybe you know that is

00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:40,550
to make old computers life and for

00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:44,530
example just today there will be a group

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:48,050
of students that will be an entropy

00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:53,320
information volunteers and the computers

00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:57,440
they're very old 32-bit and actually

00:34:53,320 --> 00:35:01,820
currently only rxte works on such

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:05,300
machines so we as do i I made a version

00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:10,520
of the customized kazuma arrow Pantone

00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:14,869
for them but currently I have a have a

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:19,150
properties about is you talk about

00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:22,980
xtg implementation and what what

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:28,300
confused me is about the xdg menu

00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:31,540
STG manual actually 4k d fokin on the

00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:34,480
xdg manual implementations are actually

00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:38,590
they I have to say they don't follow the

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:42,340
spec and rxte

00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:47,260
follow suspects but I have a problem is

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:50,830
that underlie in the menu is come you

00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:52,900
know easy co-project we use underline to

00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:57,580
separate the tag in the application name

00:35:52,900 --> 00:36:00,910
but in in the I tried the news

00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:04,600
Ubuntu 1804 the problem is still there

00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:10,210
is just the other lies come okay I'm not

00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:14,710
sure if you have re-implemented in the

00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:17,230
menu yeah yeah yeah yeah if the name

00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:23,410
contains the underlying needs it will

00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:26,260
become yes because only Eric's te has

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:28,660
these program okay okay

00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:36,910
KD Cano and except she they all they're

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:38,830
all okay only because we are actually

00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:42,010
using the positive provided by can oh

00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:47,020
yeah but but I have to say that cannot

00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:51,670
does not follow either but I know I know

00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:55,210
that you you must reuse some component

00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:56,740
of that but at least this is so far what

00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:01,720
I have tried that but I haven't tried

00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:06,400
all rescues encourage you to try a huge

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:11,380
yeah it's a so far I'm also waiting for

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:13,300
the Ubuntu 1813 yeah because I because I

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,600
need to make their life I saw you know

00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:19,990
so if I need to remove the LT and who's

00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:24,960
the execute again is it's not so easy so

00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:24,960
just the two comments for you thank you

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:38,070
I'm a comment and also open question for

00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,680
everybody so um thank you uh Pistons a

00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:44,130
year's effort to make this a lively

00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:47,370
environment for us but I want to point

00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:50,100
out one thing the most role is not a

00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:53,400
limitation it's the it's a challenge

00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:57,750
also the niche for example when I start

00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:01,380
to use the PC I walk home with step

00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:03,960
where you seen as a 4445 Robby's people

00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,620
go guys probably remember that time and

00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,300
the steer-in is how many 20 years later

00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,330
we still have this problem because you

00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:15,870
have a new impetus and I said Rosa bleep

00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:18,480
I or something I say April wash steer we

00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:23,040
still have a law and how well we won't

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,900
have some kind of a GUI autologous the

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,650
question is now we want to reproduce

00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:32,610
this experience on desktop into the new

00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:34,530
things is how can we Queenie echo system

00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,290
which i think is very important for

00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:39,840
open-source how can we bring this kind

00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:41,760
of computational environment to some

00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,540
people especially young people which

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,660
cannot afford to have a PC for their arm

00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:51,510
in a past to new generation in my case I

00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:54,900
was yeah I'm kind of apology so I'm the

00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:57,660
few people play with PC and the pit net

00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,030
but not now that everybody can be scary

00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,040
but not for young people and for rural

00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,900
people how can we bring this country

00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,700
until then it's a new change I don't

00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,830
have an answer but I'm thinking this I

00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:11,220
want to indicate this a way to share

00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:15,420
this campaign I still have April PowerPC

00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:18,990
g4 which can I can unlock anything to do

00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,820
bang to and so I'm thinking I mean if I

00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,340
can donate this computer to some young

00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,740
kid which don't afford a fault about a

00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:28,320
new computer I like to and this I think

00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:31,020
is something we as the community of

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,170
open-source can think about how can we

00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:37,170
give this abundant things from the old

00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:39,810
technology so so now everybody not just

00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,750
for some kind of engineer or some kind

00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,810
of rich guys

00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:46,599
in the city we can also we can all have

00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:51,660
this computing power to use of this kind

00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:51,660
of walk things yeah thank you thank you

00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:56,920
yeah we will keep trying to try our best

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,319
to make sure it still work for all the

00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,660
hardware and just mentioned that it's

00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:04,690
not the only focus to stay like we're

00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:08,910
you still have to care user experience

00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:11,859
yeah hello my name is Andrea Stella I

00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:14,079
just want to make a little mark that you

00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:16,690
joined to free software project I really

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,640
applauses because it's so rare and you

00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,250
cannot mention it frequently enough

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,500
that's that's a good move because we

00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:26,670
have so many tests of environment but in

00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:36,430
principle we only need one good one

00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:38,410
thank you for this thank you hi my name

00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:40,180
is Catherine Sarah I want to thank you

00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:46,839
very much for your work I've been using

00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:52,210
lxd for many years I right now I've been

00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:54,099
working on hmm I have a DD friend who is

00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:58,000
very angry at me for not making bug

00:40:54,099 --> 00:41:02,880
reports or Alex day and I promise I will

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:07,599
try to do better as a user in terms of

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,940
features there are some practical things

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,329
that I think might make it easier to use

00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:17,170
on a very tiny screen yes I have used it

00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:21,730
in a chroot on Nokia n900

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:23,290
which is a small nokia phone that I use

00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:26,460
I think had me go or something and they

00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:30,550
used a match matchbook matchbox

00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:33,640
derivative and I thought I made LXDE

00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:36,220
work on that but then I would have to do

00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,190
very frustrating things like find an alt

00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:41,950
key and click something equivalent to a

00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:43,810
Alt key and right click to move the

00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:48,280
window so I could find the button to

00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:51,220
click so obviously those things would be

00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,840
tricky but I think they would make LXDE

00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,030
portable too many small arm board

00:41:53,840 --> 00:42:00,010
that are coming out another one that I

00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:04,400
made it work on was the pocket chip

00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:06,740
their effort they did a modified Debian

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,810
install on that as well and I got on the

00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:13,480
user forums and called myself Debian

00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:16,100
user on the pocket chip forums and again

00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,980
match box looked like it worked a little

00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,510
better because they did fullscreen but I

00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:23,120
don't know if I can help with these

00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:25,640
things in the future be nice thank you

00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:28,250
very much actually it's a big headache

00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,200
for us because we actually encourage

00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:33,800
people to try different we know manager

00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,930
but although they all claim to support

00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,030
net WM protocol most of them work

00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:41,960
totally different when you plug in

00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:44,090
another window manager you have got many

00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,870
problems here and there but you know you

00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:51,020
don't know the root cause it should work

00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:53,210
but most of the time you just get some

00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,490
some problem here and there but you

00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:57,980
don't know why so so I think that's one

00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:01,880
of the reason why the project keep doing

00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:03,920
their own window manager but but I think

00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,010
it's better to let the user choose

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:14,000
whatever they want yeah but not all of

00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:17,240
the combination work yeah so so yeah

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,110
agree agree when you go to a new desktop

00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:22,670
and I'm right now I have installed

00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:25,250
cinnamon because I felt that that's a

00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,200
good effort I should try it and I like

00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,270
it overall but it's slow and I have to

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,270
click five seven things just to do

00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:34,550
something I used to be able to do with

00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:39,680
yep if you have some pie report that

00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:41,210
cannot be handled you can yeah yeah it's

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:46,450
actually better to use the bug tracker

00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:48,860
but you if you yeah if you want yes

00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:55,910
do we have more question we still have

00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:58,260
five minutes of time or we can just take

00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:02,520
a look at

00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:07,060
then let's see demo actually found a

00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:09,430
sorry actually can you tell if this is

00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,010
the cute program or jiggle program that

00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:15,040
doesn't really matter

00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:17,320
yeah this is the file manager and you

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:25,510
just look like the original JDK version

00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:31,300
and quick responsive I close it and yep

00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:39,220
oh whoops move to another screen yeah

00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:41,370
but okay it's kind of frustrating with

00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:45,240
my window

00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:51,120
oops doesn't work never do that demo

00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:56,440
yeah but there's one thing I wanna show

00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:59,680
this is our new file archiver and it's

00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:04,450
for a graphical user interface for you

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:07,060
to to handle compressed files and does

00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:10,720
does anybody find out that the UI look

00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:16,840
very familiar is poorly from you know

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:20,680
viola to cute yeah and you just used the

00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,820
same the same way as the GTA version of

00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,640
course we don't have clients I

00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:29,680
declaration but it's pretty similar and

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:32,620
this is the file dialog you can see that

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,480
it's actually not a default file dialog

00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,880
provided by cute it's much more

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,130
feature-rich and look pretty similar to

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,010
the gtk file chooser

00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:47,680
but it's implemented in cute and backed

00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:49,870
by our file manager so we try to do

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:54,300
better integrations and make sure

00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:58,870
everything is still fast and responsive

00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:02,440
yep and yeah the user the overall user

00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:07,360
experience did not change that much by

00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:10,540
just changing your UI toolkit yeah so so

00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:13,060
if you are feel frustrated

00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:21,930
with all the LSD maybe you can try the

00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:21,930
new one any more questions

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:31,860
if not then let's thank speaker and we

00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:31,860
