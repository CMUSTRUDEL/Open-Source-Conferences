The lightweight classic desktop environment LXDE has been developed for 12 years and remains one of the best choices for less powerful hardware.

In 2013, the LXDE project teamed up with the Razor-Qt project and initiated LXQt desktop together. This is a historic event in FOSS since most of the time we saw forks rather than merges. It's especially true for desktop environments. In this session, we will talk about the past and future of LXDE/LXQt and share what we have learned during the journey.
