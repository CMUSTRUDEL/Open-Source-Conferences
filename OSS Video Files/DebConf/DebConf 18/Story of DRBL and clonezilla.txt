The DRBL and Clonezilla projects were born in Taiwan, and were heavily developed at NCHC. They were needed in the computer classroom and cluster computing in the beginning. Later as Debian live-package debuted in 2006, the DRBL/Clonezilla team created "Clonezilla live" with live-package and this Debian derivative release became popular. If you are interested in how the projects were born, and the evolution about them, please come to this talk.

	00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,730
so thank you for coming at least this

00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:16,100
talk I will give a story about a DI Bao

00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:19,460
and Krong dia so we are from the yeah

00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,970
the DAV and Konya Tina of course okay so

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,970
[Music]

00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:30,560
this two project actually are many

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:33,290
developed in NCHS NZ's National Centre

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,200
for highest performance computing its

00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:42,710
nest to this campus just maybe five

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:44,690
minutes walking distance and I will give

00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,030
you a few background then I will tell

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:51,739
the whole story and I prepare more than

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:55,219
100 photos nice nice ok 100 photos to

00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:58,460
tell you the history okay so as usual

00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,980
founded in 1991 and you know basically

00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,489
there are three branches in central here

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:07,220
and hydro 99 and we provide the core

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:11,080
facilities for the research Research

00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,900
Institute and universities and

00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,510
government and some some of the

00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,600
industries so we have computing resource

00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:27,890
rich storage and hype and they work it

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:31,400
okay so we also for polar free software

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:34,280
open source and open data we provide

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,240
some of the mirror side for example and

00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,500
photo be important too for fedora open

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,410
fields if I found something either and

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,560
also as you see one of the saucepot mini

00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:48,230
site and ohdn mirror site is open source

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:54,530
distributed network I think I forgot a

00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:57,680
Hornet and we also we we also run open

00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:04,360
shrimp mirror site cache server actually

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,360
so I can give you some of the

00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:16,650
yeah that Lots the you will cultural NCH

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,080
website and free pizza well depth and

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:24,390
you can check the mirror side we have

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,769
some more me you know service here okay

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,440
of course stay beyond you one o plane

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:33,840
okay and as I mentioned sauce porch okay

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,160
we are one of the mirror side and ostian

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,110
yeah you can see one in CAC and also for

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,040
the OpenStreetMap

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:47,730
the open data for a just data and you

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,750
can see that the sightings in true HRU

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:55,430
is surfsport I think I remember is about

00:02:51,750 --> 00:03:00,720
twenty one country or yeah 21 countries

00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:09,329
in Asia okay and this one this server is

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:12,510
right we are just right now in Syria see

00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:20,940
beauty not very far okay so I back to my

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:23,459
slice and I mentioned to Padgett right

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,290
the first one big PR BOE the phone e we

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,389
can be it's in the beginning we should

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,319
have a better name but you know it's

00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:34,019
used and imported five years data and we

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,810
think it squirrel is grew up and we

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,910
should give a paternity we try to change

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,579
in a bus still it's not easy so we keep

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,130
it up for name PR biro this one is limo

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,959
put in Nina's basically you can from the

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:51,269
service you understand it's just one

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:54,870
server and provider you know the always

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,910
service for the biggest client so we

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,419
start networking and we can have a think

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,650
right

00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:04,290
finally the the think I mentioned is for

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,120
you to run a full application in local

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,109
computing resource okay

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,700
or you can use the TRPs system in the

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:16,160
cluster computing or computer classroom

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:19,109
basically it let you see eazy-e

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,310
easily to set up the disk in this

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:23,520
environment

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,680
enhance environment and another project

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,190
I mentioned is Grandia Kamiya is a

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,320
polishing and disk imaging utility is

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:36,690
something like northern courtroom image

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:40,490
so you can use for for dinners make

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:44,610
always windows VST and something like

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:46,980
VMware ESX something like that and you

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,350
can use chromia for a single machine

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,510
backup recovery or you can use that for

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,100
the masive deployment for masive

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:56,940
deployment I mentioned it's for a

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,060
computer classroom crust and also for

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,930
you can you can see that there are many

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:05,669
USB flash drive ok so you can also use

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:08,910
this chromia to do this kind of massive

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:14,760
deployment and we are lots of developers

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:15,900
ok and its support I think 14 damages

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,300
now ok

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,660
you are very very welcome to to help us

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,660
to change data then we ok and ok that's

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,060
the background so sabah any questions

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,530
about the background about the NCHC

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:35,880
apart is to project and before I start

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:40,080
the stories no okay so I'll start the

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:45,780
stories it's back to 2001 it's more than

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:54,120
17 years ago and we I show you some rest

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:57,270
in the beginning actually we we set up

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,450
the first pure work our cluster

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,620
you can tell Elijah the monitor is still

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:07,320
CRT and we use the standard PC to set up

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,580
this kind of piece caster that's the

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:13,470
first prototype for a caster in NCHS

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:19,350
ok and whether we cut some more budget

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:23,330
so we know it's a on the rig so it's

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:27,240
much better than the one you saw on the

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:31,470
textile ok and we set up the machine

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,199
like this and that's people and we spin

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:38,860
it won't finish you like something like

00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:41,830
but the problem is after we drain with

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,840
we test this machine and HR would

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,770
provide some more friendly friendly user

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:51,460
to use this piece krasna but I remember

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,120
after about one year we have a problem

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,979
with the hard drive

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,479
it's a it's a I think more than more

00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:03,849
than 40 or something

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:05,949
Hydra protectors we saw a lot of

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:06,810
Exeter's and you know it's a problem to

00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,000
depressed

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:12,580
we had to forecast the application you

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,590
know maybe one nod stop then the

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,250
application will all stop because they

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:22,660
use a VI or ppm something I got to to

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:24,550
distribute the computing so we have to

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,389
wait for another hard drive and we have

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:31,710
to set up configuration to install the

00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:35,800
operating system and compute computer

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:38,590
applications then you know it it took

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,320
maybe a few hours to maybe one to two

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,880
days to make one machine to pack so we

00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,759
think maybe it's a bit

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,520
we had to had better solution for this

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,599
so a lot of time we saw some more

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,030
document about a disc release

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,719
environment so okay we set up the disc

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,520
release environment for a machine and

00:07:54,719 --> 00:08:01,539
repress one by one in the beginning it

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:06,490
was not only is what not 40 hard drives

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:09,280
suddenly fail maybe just one and two and

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,190
laser in gradually we took used

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,310
resistant to repair the disk resistant

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,560
will be priced to fix this issue okay

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:22,300
and later I remember we had more than 30

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:25,330
or 40 machine actually is they are they

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,969
were run in industries environment so ok

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:31,210
so we can experience about a tea stories

00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:34,450
environment okay so I that's all some

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,099
more photos a data we didn't take some

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,490
more photos about the environment but

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:42,400
just how we're and you can share this

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,370
version is really expensive you can see

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,260
memory a lot of time is it was very

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:57,100
expensive name walking since

00:08:47,260 --> 00:09:00,340
okay that's the machine and later we the

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:04,540
environment he was ready and we moved to

00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:07,360
the machine room the whole system okay

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,430
so you can tell now now the the machine

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,690
are actually in the machine room okay

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:17,820
but still it's a high issue so we you

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:22,450
spend to you know to call resistant okay

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:24,550
the photos about crossing the machine

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:28,150
noon okay so in the beginning we have

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:42,490
some experience about the disc resistant

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:46,500
and back to here back to 2002 at a time

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:50,080
BSA anyone from Microsoft yeah

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:56,820
no no yes so so you have a middle with

00:09:50,080 --> 00:10:02,580
BSA write an essay in 2002 yeah and BSA

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,580
there's some of the you know if I can

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,470
anyway

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:14,620
BSA have some or advertisement and at

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:17,740
that time it tell people are you you

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:21,760
bill company or you use a pad or

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:28,300
software okay if you you know you are a

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:31,990
which soul in trace our line okay and it

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:35,080
will tell the police okay

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:39,460
you're commonly used pirated software

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,700
you might get the highest the numb the

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:47,730
highest price price you got might be one

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:50,560
median indeed Alice so rotten the

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:55,240
business season of Risa where at that

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:59,500
time it was not so mature to use in

00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:02,200
on desktop environment but some of the

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,910
three bodies the other thing is it's a

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:09,339
master we need to have another solution

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:12,279
not only one solution for the IT

00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:16,589
industry especially the computing

00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,589
resource or the desktop environment so

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,149
the Parliament Parliament lawmaker in

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:25,420
apartment have a summer puppy here in

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:27,279
and we participated a puppy hearing and

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,320
we see as you proposing we should have a

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,690
national project to handle this kind of

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,279
issue we should have a summer project to

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,920
take care of the open source free

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,709
software we integrate that we have

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,200
something to ready for the come for the

00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:43,510
tester to use and then we have other

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,170
options so we don't have to be you know

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:52,300
blocked by some of the vendors so so we

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:57,700
made a professor's ck1 here and in a

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:59,920
parent and professor Wong introduce

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,850
professor Mao and Tony mama yeah

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,420
professor MA

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:07,029
he was he was a he they okay and he he

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:12,279
told us that he would like to you know

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:15,100
to to teach the sub where the free

00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:19,810
software in a squirrel's but the problem

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:23,890
is computing computing classroom or a

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:28,750
lot on all rain Windows Microsoft

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:30,490
Windows system and he told us even he

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,339
would like to have someone to install a

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:36,399
software free software free operating

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:38,170
system in that computer Karen no

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,480
computer teachers allow them to use

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:44,350
because after that the teachers have to

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,180
repress or have to wait for the the team

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,450
to repress the whole system back to

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:52,959
recovery the system back to the original

00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:54,760
environment is it's a it was a risk no

00:12:52,959 --> 00:13:00,640
one would like to take that kind of risk

00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:04,300
so and professor mom think there's a DSP

00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:08,440
season so we should try ality TF season

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:13,860
for the computing classroom okay so

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:18,640
he had held a medium to diagnose the IOT

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:21,970
species and in Fling Queen Judy high

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,060
school it was in simple right you know

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:29,490
what I pay Kunti and that's the first

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:35,140
time we made a jury okay yeah okay so

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:37,960
yeah I actually do not photo about latte

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,660
I should keep one you know so I can only

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,600
have the photo today for the win goes on

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:47,380
and yeah that's an jury and professor

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:53,320
mouse so homepage okay not only for the

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:56,110
photo and later we because we have the

00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,390
experience so we I mean with this great

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,580
experience we tried that LTS we part we

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,890
thing is not a good solution for for a

00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:06,760
computer girls ruin in in Taiwan because

00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:09,250
the Machine powerful enough I mean a

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,590
student machine a powerful now but we do

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,630
not have the budget to have a super

00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:16,330
server for this

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:21,550
for other LTS pieces and you know to run

00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:25,450
a species and for 32 clients you need a

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:29,110
lot hang the brain resized the camp the

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:32,410
CPU it was spend a lot of money on that

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:37,210
so we tried the disc the solution we use

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:43,570
in the PC cast so after a few days I

00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:46,930
think yeah not we have web we proposed a

00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,630
lot I'm at a meeting we proposed to have

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,820
a history system by ether port and uh

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:55,390
nervous and a nice actually thoroughly

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:57,700
is similar to the PSC pilot I'm not all

00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:01,980
of machine have the PCC

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:06,160
firmware so we we use the ether put and

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:09,040
data in to Sol okay

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,620
in 2002 and in June 20 we finished the

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,620
prototype so we have one machine go to

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:22,000
perform from primary school to to teach

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:26,170
the two dead professor Mott

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:40,389
have a teachers to teach and I have some

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:43,959
photo I'm naughty okay okay so that day

00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:46,750
we used that server to to provide a the

00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:49,000
history taste hub environment for those

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,680
motion I think it's 20 something or 30

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,670
machines

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,620
I'm not a yeah so people use this it was

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,360
running I think remember is what Ronnie

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:06,420
on her head or on Bendrick I forgot yeah

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:23,889
but you can tell that yeah not a does

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:27,490
and so so they do in in September we we

00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:30,759
announced the DRB assistant in foreign

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,620
university so to tell people that we

00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,959
have the cistern ready then you can use

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:39,480
this kind of style for for the free

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:43,689
software education centenary art and and

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:47,050
in 2002 in December of 10 we had a

00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:50,019
Hangang Christ training course for the

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:53,290
high school teachers but it was a

00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:56,879
nightmare because we use the document I

00:16:53,290 --> 00:17:04,439
can show you some of you talk document I

00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:04,439
think that's the one and the document is

00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:15,909
it's yeah a walk for ahead and that

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:19,270
argument we keep all the details for you

00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:21,100
you understand that the junior high

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,319
school teacher they cannot handle this

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,959
kind of document we have to you know to

00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:29,650
teach step by step and too many details

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:32,770
where to keep so I remember I'm not a

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:36,159
after one six o'clock seven o'clock

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:39,360
seven hours and just one teacher finish

00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:39,360
the text happy

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:46,000
I think he was 30-something teachers

00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:50,169
just one finish our step and the Machine

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,260
he he prepared he installed can be as

00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:56,110
dicks observer for the rest they are

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,659
they were frustrated it was a nightmare

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,610
for us so later we think it's not a good

00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:03,549
solution to tell people that argument

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:06,309
you know document and you you saw

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:13,240
resistance oh okay we'll give up grab

00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:18,549
out this tunnel so we data we send the

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:23,110
document into the squib the the software

00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:27,990
so yeah in 2003

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:30,850
you know we had before at the HOA we

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:33,460
gradually develop as the system is one

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:37,179
not already just within one or two

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:40,179
months gradually develop okay then

00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:43,450
later in 2003 that's another story for

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:48,400
for for the second project Krone year

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:52,240
project not tan in 2003 in March we have

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,960
a new hardware now in a CSS computer

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,940
classroom and before we have chromia

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,690
project that computer classroom user

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:04,150
northern cost Rajan 624 assistant for

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,240
the new hardware northern cause cannot

00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:10,799
handle the new hardware so it was a you

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:14,350
know they were our our computing

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:18,549
classroom at the mystery he had to

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:20,830
propose to find a new news software

00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:24,010
another on your paperwork here

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,429
- so and we we think okay we can run a

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:29,260
discrete server why not we can just copy

00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:32,860
just Chrome the system for that computer

00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:35,830
classroom so we try to do that so not

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:39,070
that's how we have the idea we have a

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:41,169
bollock chromia project so in the

00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:45,549
beginning we used I remember is a snake

00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:50,409
we assistant and we use the pad pad

00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:55,539
image project to develop the chromium

00:19:50,409 --> 00:20:00,100
project and in March we have we

00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:02,139
incorporate the the chrony approach into

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,840
the Treo so in the beginning with

00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:08,590
available actually the server system to

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:11,710
deploy to for the massive deployment for

00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:14,289
the computer classroom in whatnot it was

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:18,240
not only for one machine in the

00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:25,419
beginning we with hybrid the project for

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:28,450
the massive deployment so in now in 2004

00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:30,940
we we had a new name because we in the

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:35,529
beginning we just call OCS open source

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:39,070
cronies system it's not a cool name so

00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:45,630
we use a another name from Konya in 2004

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:45,630
so I should have some old photos about

00:20:50,039 --> 00:21:10,710
okay so yeah I skip some old photos okay

00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:12,760
in 2003 we also prepare a system for for

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,360
in a primary school

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,730
42 teacher somewhere about a free

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:26,289
software so that's all apology idea

00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:29,230
system and we also during knowledge we

00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:34,380
have summer talks and some foreign

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,380
bodies talk no just all summer strike

00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:43,149
summer talk we have invited some other

00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:43,720
people here it's Enrico yeah no no he's

00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:47,740
not here

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:52,080
I mean yeah so in 2003 right I think

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:54,570
yeah we we also have some of the

00:21:52,080 --> 00:22:00,580
promotion about an open source project

00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:03,190
not only our project also for our open

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,230
source free software okay which has some

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,860
I should say free software now for

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:11,889
Windows okay so yeah a lot of time at

00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:15,580
2006 I remember we have also another in

00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:20,259
the last of the first time we met Gianni

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:22,889
come on he was just ok and never mind

00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,889
all right

00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:32,769
and also we also went to Indonesia you

00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:38,529
know a lot time there was a big tsunami

00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:42,929
in 2006 I remember and we used the

00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:42,929
similar technology to help to build

00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:52,059
about a tsunami is nothing to do with

00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:55,210
the open caronia or the area of that

00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:59,110
because of the tsunami we we helped we

00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:01,929
went to RJ and for help to build in a

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:04,929
hidden incision either knee center in

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:13,590
learning center so you can see that are

00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:13,590
the energy center there all right

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:28,290
so these photos are about a system we

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:33,549
use at NCC come on the photo is okay

00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:36,010
yeah very cool bun and this machine is

00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:39,100
strange okay never mind

00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:42,940
yeah that's about the discrete system we

00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:45,940
use in actually our administrator used

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:48,720
the tea obviously actually chromia

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,730
server edition 24 years instant from

00:23:48,720 --> 00:24:03,700
2003 and here now the season is still

00:23:51,730 --> 00:24:07,690
run in there first time we participate

00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:13,480
in for free software comprehensive we

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:15,660
was in in France and George he is now

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,360
here this morning he was here and he

00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:22,059
invited us to give a talk about a div

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,940
assistant so that's how we start to

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:27,160
participate in the free software

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:37,720
companies international free software

00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:43,510
companies yeah not so well we have a

00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:45,250
press conference about this to project

00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:50,110
about the Avianca media

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:53,110
okay now was for my boss request so we

00:24:50,110 --> 00:25:00,160
had a lot okay so you can tell it was in

00:24:53,110 --> 00:25:03,580
in in Popham primary school okay and we

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,360
show a system ensure a solution you know

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,360
for a press conference

00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:24,700
yeah okay so let's just first of all

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:34,120
then okay I'll pick two here you know

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:37,750
and okay Fung 2000 2007 we started to as

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,460
I mentioned we the problem the cornea in

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,280
the beginning it was only for the server

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:45,790
edition so when people have to make a

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,250
pickup or to the policies and he need a

00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:51,160
server to do this kind of thing but most

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:53,050
people they they they must have returned

00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,360
maybe they just need to pick up one

00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:57,100
machine and they don't they don't want

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,760
to have a server for these kind of

00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,420
simple things so a locked and live

00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,490
system

00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:11,980
they be like that a light package one

00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:14,770
mature so so we use the live page to to

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:18,220
make a deal a courier life so thank you

00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:20,650
to the tenían yeah yeah that's the first

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,690
time I made you immediately okay thank

00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:26,080
you very much yeah you had to help us a

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:31,420
lot so we started to topic chromia as a

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:33,640
courier life so they this smarty

00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:36,400
tribution turn out to be successful you

00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,650
know because people they then now then

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:43,570
they can only use a USB flash drive or

00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:48,850
CD to teach hope to to to pick up to

00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:55,180
read to recovery the whole season and so

00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:59,170
we in 2007 we also because of the repo

00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:02,440
software deepest of organization in

00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:04,510
France and they introduced that the

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,200
tourists nowadays countries that we can

00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:11,770
participate so we we when we produced a

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:16,600
black hound can taste of and I will show

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:21,100
you some of the photos yeah that's about

00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:23,190
the contest it was in small song in

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:28,360
France I think yeah

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:31,619
yeah and yeah we we we we showed a

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:34,659
system we presented the whole system and

00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:38,399
we wonder the first prices in the public

00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:38,399
sector somewhere yeah

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:56,220
and in 2009 we missed in we we got a I

00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:05,410
love it by ourself but we got an initial

00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:07,660
price from the premium yeah

00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:12,730
Prime Minister okay you can say that

00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:15,280
Prime Minister yeah yeah okay no that's

00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:29,140
the price we have he's our national

00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:34,780
price and then in 2010 then 2010 will

00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:37,930
cut the project amongst the cornea

00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:40,630
project was chosen as the project monks

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,370
on SourceForge okay I do not

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:46,000
yeah I should I should find some more

00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:51,220
photos brought up but I didn't pull out

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,920
and there in 2011 yeah we have a you

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:57,250
know that's the previous that they be a

00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:04,740
leader right yeah he came to Taiwan and

00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:06,430
kept some talk I remember and a week oh

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,680
okay all right

00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:10,680
and we were there yeah

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,450
and

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:37,770
in 2012 and we and they such a company

00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:39,720
in Japan they actually they use Konya

00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:44,750
they actually they modify they've

00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,110
improved chromium and they put this

00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:50,300
sober

00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:53,940
in the software in their product and

00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:57,120
they call it a miracle Dena the company

00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,460
mimicked Elena's I remember the name for

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,440
their solution it's a miracle in our

00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:07,770
Savior sister Saviour I think yes so we

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:10,110
have a they have a press conference for

00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:15,390
their new Prada so they invite us to

00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:18,980
join their press conference and at the

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:22,020
same time we they also embarrass to the

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:25,440
opens open source conference in Japan

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:28,260
yeah he's always in Japan so we have the

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,260
boost there yeah you can tell that yeah

00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,600
so that's about that's how we start to

00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:36,360
cooperate with the mean of our Nina's

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,690
it's because the ammonia they really

00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:45,390
modify a lot and they gave us our source

00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:46,880
code and we we device and we yeah except

00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:50,880
the page and later

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:54,900
Ronia can handle a lot of different I

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:59,340
mean the hardware I mean the for paint

00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:02,430
Marty pays Marty pays for a hard drive

00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,270
something like that so it's because of

00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,610
me Mina corniness

00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:10,740
otherwise before we can only handle the

00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:13,830
disk name like device Stas TB HT HT be

00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:17,270
something a lot but later the page

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:20,400
provides something like 40 this kind of

00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:25,410
device CC is a is something like this

00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:28,310
cannibal pays for a hard drive and also

00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:31,590
they provide some of the tank nose

00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:34,860
diagnostic information because they they

00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:36,450
know this is a product so they have to

00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,960
collect a lotta input

00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:43,110
the liberal users are comfort or

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,850
something they can get the information

00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:49,060
so they can diagnose they can fix the

00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:58,300
path so they contribute a lot to us I'll

00:31:49,060 --> 00:32:00,400
patch it okay okay we start at our

00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,110
mission we went to some of the open

00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:09,520
source Cumbres three so become brands

00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:13,200
like the one in dynastic in in Germany

00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,200
yes okay

00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:29,490
and this one is another one in 2016 in

00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,530
2016 yes mr. user in near

00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:34,920
giotto you watch this thing in United

00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:38,070
States they told us that because they

00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:41,400
need we provide a solution for the

00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:43,980
dismiss the server edition part is too

00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:47,210
complicated because we adhere be your

00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,830
life you can use the ability for the

00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:52,170
server Edition and we have premiered

00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,710
live for the single machine backup and

00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:58,650
recovery but he told it to communicating

00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:01,050
to their users can you just merge them

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:03,480
to one one one distribution just caught

00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:06,810
the RB or not we still be alive we can

00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,780
pick up one system and we can also use

00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:11,730
to deploy courses and I told him that

00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,160
you just used TR be alive you can do

00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:17,550
that for the same thing he told told us

00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,930
that crew niala is lighter and is easier

00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:23,640
to use per bond or something like that

00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:28,610
okay so they he persuaded us so we we we

00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:33,810
have a conference near near his school

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:37,200
so we went to his lab then we discussed

00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:41,490
for one voltage and data we okay we can

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:46,260
idea how to implement so so data we can

00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:48,420
we back to Taiwan we remember we spent

00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:52,020
about maybe two or three month to

00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:54,690
develop this console system so later we

00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:57,060
have a light server from your life

00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:59,070
server with large server is easier for

00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,990
people to use chat with the corner light

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,210
you can use one machine per carbon and

00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:06,920
recover in part with the lightest server

00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:09,660
you can reuse the DHCP service in maybe

00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:14,400
in the land or in a computer classroom

00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:19,010
or in a cluster environment and with now

00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:27,480
one you can use a multicast or

00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:31,620
BitTorrent system deployment ok so we

00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,520
finish that one and now it's easier for

00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,620
you people to you

00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,780
the deacon of a solution with cornea

00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:39,960
life you can have a one machine pickup

00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:43,530
and you can also you get the massive

00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:48,300
deployment for a disk Mesa fiscal in one

00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:53,270
computer and OH or you can use a light

00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:56,190
server to teacher Butte to do the

00:34:53,270 --> 00:35:01,850
sistent appointment for masive computers

00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:05,280
Mason and okay so that's photos and I

00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:09,420
still have five minutes so let me check

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,780
your eyes viewing photos okay so so a

00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:16,170
lot I'm we we think that about the time

00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,450
we have to need have a article about

00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:21,240
this one so we have a journal article

00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:25,110
about the solution for the massive

00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,240
deployment and it's open at six so you

00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:30,510
can just download these these articles

00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:33,060
about a full background and where the

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:39,840
kita videos about this project Krone

00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:46,410
your project okay so yeah I just

00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:50,160
mentioned okay in the live server in the

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:55,260
journal paper so I I think I'm finished

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,190
most of the photos let me check you guys

00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,040
do here son

00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:04,200
no okay I think that's about oh okay I

00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:10,490
keep some of the time to answer some

00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,490
more questions so if you have questions

00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:21,380
so you do have questions free sex now

00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:24,500
and all you have question data we have a

00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:31,780
boost outside and we can chat discuss

00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:31,780
more so any questions yeah please

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:43,820
they are recording has come they don't

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:45,220
have a plan to distribute it to another

00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:50,770
[Music]

00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:50,770
hardware architectures like arm or

00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:58,520
question actually we are we already

00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:01,660
implement the arms is people now that's

00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,660
much easier for us because

00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:24,390
actually we have some more testing what

00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:25,170
yeah but I put I just put on my my my

00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,130
sight

00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:32,549
yeah I'm 64 is ready and we test on on

00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:40,049
the virtual machine environment it was

00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:43,140
okay they are not too many unsuitable

00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:46,170
server so yeah that's Department but I'm

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:50,099
32 is a little bit much more complicated

00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:53,190
for us because I remember they be an

00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:58,319
actuary drop less support for I'm sorry

00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:59,880
fall from 9-10 right anyone anyone here

00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:04,349
okay it's a first

00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:06,690
yeah not yet not yet not yet but maybe

00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:09,359
yeah and remember it because it was

00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:13,039
complicated for the pull order because

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,539
you know for I'm 34 the poor loader is I

00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,930
don't know how to handle other out in we

00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:22,980
do not have too much time to otherwise

00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:27,619
actually we we need this one because not

00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,619
I can tell you another story

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:44,519
I'm not sure you are familiar with the

00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:44,519
only only on in a war switch system

00:38:53,980 --> 00:39:01,000
yeah that's the one it's because some

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:06,900
mobile because cornea can handle the the

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:10,810
Craster right past a professor in in

00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:13,869
Chicago Northwestern Northwest

00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:16,780
University professor Chen he told us

00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:19,630
that because he's in they were Center

00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:22,810
they were Center so so he told us that

00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:25,240
ok chromia can handle can people operate

00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:29,349
the whole brick sees that by only for a

00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:33,339
completely not why he needed to deploy

00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:36,700
depositor inquiry include the wreck

00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:40,270
completely not and the switch so he can

00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:42,790
you know to swap the system very quickly

00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:46,180
because he he need the environment to do

00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:48,640
some more tests so we actually that in

00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,609
the beginning we tried I'm 32

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:57,089
because that some of the only switch is

00:39:51,609 --> 00:40:02,880
I'm sorry to humerus of God which one

00:39:57,089 --> 00:40:06,010
its receiver supporter right anyone from

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,790
now here okay it because because this

00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:13,740
caliber switch around is wrong in dinner

00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:17,319
system so it turn out to be a very good

00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:20,440
solution I mean if we want to deploy a

00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:23,560
network switch we can use this one only

00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:26,740
switch its support it's actually

00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,740
standard by Facebook is the project is

00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:33,359
open computing open computer project

00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:39,569
open computer project all CP years so

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:43,000
that's why we start to to try I'm 64 and

00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:46,480
I'm suitable it ready but we found out

00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:51,609
that a sign remember there's no only

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:54,910
switch the CPU is MCC for only 32 but an

00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:57,670
array they and some of 86

00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:04,210
okay so that's okay cornea can handle

00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:06,430
that pop or I'm I'm 64 Grady yeah but we

00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,810
didn't a visual release because we need

00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,000
more tests

00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:12,640
so you by inches please come to us and

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,910
