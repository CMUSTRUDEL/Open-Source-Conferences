OpenRC is a dependency based init system written in C and shell
script. It is modular and can be extended by s6 supervisor and Linux
cgroup. Keeping itself simple and stupid, OpenRC values Unix philosophy.

OpenRC is shipped with Debian stable since Jessie and runs on kFreeBSD
and Hurd besides Linux.  It readily runs Debian in LXC, OpenVZ, vserver
containers, usermodel Linux or Xen domains.

In this talk I am going to walk you through the features of OpenRC, and
show you how OpenRC is hacked to suit our needs in real life.
