	00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,490
okay welcome this is this is exactly the

00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:13,280
number of attendees in the audience from

00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:17,029
my first talk I had about the gunman so

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,619
that's I'm used to this because the the

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:20,570
number of people who are interested in

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:23,779
medicine and free software is very small

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,550
yes very small intersection so I'm used

00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:27,790
to this but so I will introduce you to

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:33,079
maybe some other peoples on the screen

00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:37,460
and what is the idea behind TB immediate

00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:42,440
c TB I admit was triggered in Bordeaux

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:44,570
it's DEFCON one in France and I have

00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,800
seen that the French guy was starting to

00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:51,429
translate the installation instructions

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,050
of some medical program and I think in

00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:56,300
translating installation it's not just

00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:59,600
stupid because you just install a

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:04,760
package and on and so I decided to have

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:07,220
a talk what would be my idea how medical

00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:12,640
software should be installed this was

00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,640
basically the idea of TB invented it was

00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,930
over some wine I prepared this talk and

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,650
finally I had in the first announcement

00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:26,630
in 2002 so we have now 16 years of TB

00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:28,550
amid we are doing here these prints and

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,760
you know who novel if he is running

00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:35,120
around here and when he seen that we are

00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,790
doing his print in Brittany and then

00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,910
walk in the winter into the water he saw

00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:43,250
what I thought you are package

00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,350
immigrants medical software but actually

00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:49,550
you need medical attention if you are

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:53,480
doing this crazy stuff so yes it's it's

00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:56,270
in some way a little bit crazy to to

00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:00,620
work in a field where people are used to

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,290
pay something and evaluates things that

00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,330
our pay is very high off and you do it

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,640
for free so this is a reason why we are

00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:11,660
also so

00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:15,010
you people here but the main thing in

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:18,709
Debian me it is anyway about biology

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:22,370
microbiology and life sciences because

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:24,440
there is some educational backgrounds

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,080
from University background we are free

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:31,400
software's way more established in then

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:35,000
in medical care who's today we are mid

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:41,930
team I did this graphs over several

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,850
years and it was started in 2009 also I

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,790
started this class because I wanted to

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:49,220
find an answer who is in the team

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:54,350
because it's not really clear we have a

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:56,630
lot of people in society as maybe 40 or

00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:59,630
50 people but they are not active also I

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:03,800
decided to make a graph of the ten

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:07,580
active applause the interesting thing is

00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,100
not that my that I'm the most active

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,590
upload out the interesting thing is that

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:16,160
we have not only one uploader we have

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,530
other teams which is not so then cetera

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,600
we have even more than 10 active upload

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:25,549
of us this was an active ones and I

00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,660
think what you can see he said since

00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:34,130
2011 it became some somehow more and

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:37,430
what is 2011 here also in other years it

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:41,510
is this is graphing the discussion of

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:44,060
the Debian mid mailing list which is

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,299
also user mailing list so they are users

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,840
who are asking for software and he also

00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:54,280
you see in 2011

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,280
something happened also here right and

00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:02,450
this is a deviant may develop our

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:05,480
mailing list is not so so here this year

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,519
2011 but he is he also something these

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,880
are the people who are hunting packs you

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,430
see also 10 people who are quite active

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,880
there are some people who left the

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,680
project for instance trust let see who

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,200
the beginning very active the yellow one

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,620
is became less activity it depends form

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,940
from his work and what time he can spend

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:33,350
on Debian meet and this is what people

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:37,910
are committing to the TV on mid get no

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:42,320
answers on you see also there are at

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:46,340
least 10 people who are doing quite

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,090
regular contributions and well no I

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:55,370
before I come to this graph I want to

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:58,070
explain these 2011 since 2011 team

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,010
activity this is a time since we are

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,770
doing year lease prints since these

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,890
people not actually this gene 10 people

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:10,430
but we are 10 to 15 people who are

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,930
meeting face to face in mostly in the

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,980
beginning of the year in January or

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,500
February and this I'm throwing this

00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,480
because it's quite important that you

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,460
meet in person like you're the DBA

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,920
confidence is very small very small

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,260
auditorium but it's important that

00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,450
people meet and work together and since

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:33,080
you know one room together or don't care

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:36,500
for any real-life stuff just sit behind

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:41,780
their computers get some code talk

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:48,380
together and that's very healthy for the

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:51,770
project the next graph shows how many

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:56,270
pictures gets attention by how many

00:05:51,770 --> 00:06:01,280
people so I would like to get this graph

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:03,470
rather like this as the package is never

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,720
maintained by only one person but rather

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:09,200
by a two or three persons and get it

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,480
shake a graph shape like this because if

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,070
only one person is committing to a

00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,790
package this is actually not team

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,250
maintained it is one person who belongs

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:23,410
to a team but it's working alone on the

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:26,960
package I need to admit that this graph

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:28,870
only shows contribution with more than

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,360
five commits

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,810
so maybe there's a single commit from a

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,790
person it's not calculate because it's

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,770
too much noise otherwise so five

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:42,190
committee says a limit when I said yes

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:45,160
it is a real contribution and then this

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,260
graph looks like this we are doing

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,320
better than than other teams which have

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:53,770
quite a steeper slope but there are

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:56,260
teams in Debian which really have only

00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:00,880
only very few packages which are

00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:03,670
maintained by only one person actually

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,740
if I'm honest about package maintained

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,230
by two persons it's also it's mostly

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,170
because people other people started the

00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:17,440
packaging and then I continued because I

00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:21,550
managed also so this is a graph which

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:27,630
shows the so-called tasks in Debian made

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:30,160
we have different tasks which is the one

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,560
it's a number of packages for the

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,400
biology tasks that that means if you are

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,230
violet is you have a lot of packages I'm

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,470
sorry for that this scale is about here

00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:44,830
600 I don't know it's not shown you on

00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:47,950
the screen so 600 packages for

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,870
biologists or if you want to develop

00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:53,770
ahead of the application you have also

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:56,110
100 packages it's kind of bio Bridal and

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,230
so by the way I know your picture what's

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:03,090
your background are you biology so

00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:07,990
medical stuff so can you say mammals

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:10,060
y'all biologists okay then maybe we talk

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,270
a little bit later so a principal TV I

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:16,420
made something for you which you can use

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:18,640
I also have prepared slide for about

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,100
10-15 minutes and then we can talk when

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,500
you can we talk your wishes and your

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,280
expectation right just for a short

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:30,700
introduction here we have some packages

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:34,720
for epidemiology its smallest statistics

00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:37,860
some are packages we have a few packages

00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,779
which are can be used in hospitals

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,269
Hospital information systems we have

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:45,510
something for medical imaging but you

00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:47,970
see the main focus of Debian made if you

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:51,779
just calculate the number of packages is

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:56,540
in biology and also here you see whether

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:59,690
we have some increase here but the 2011

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:03,240
is reflected from years after we meet

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:06,300
the cough also is quite steep so meeting

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,450
of peoples has a good effect and the

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,079
counter indication is the the meetings

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,870
are basically done by biologists and in

00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:17,640
the other fields you don't see this 2011

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:23,640
King so it's really important that you

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:26,670
meet well something which I really liked

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,170
is some very good advice by John Meador

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,589
:

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:37,200
I wasn't hired back in 2015 15 as a

00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:41,490
debian conference and I taught Murdoch

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,199
said after 15 years working on the DVM a

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,500
project or on the topic payment of

00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:49,110
pyramid and people in my Institute which

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,170
is actually a Medical Institute which

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:56,040
was my motivation to do all this they

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,829
started using it and he said what only

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,589
15 years you young guys should be more

00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:03,360
patient I should hurry up since after 15

00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:05,760
years I won't be dead but you have so

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:11,220
much time on this was some advice I

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:15,779
think it's kind of a wisdom right well

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:18,810
15 years seems to be much and you are

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:22,890
even younger than me but in principle

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:26,250
every good thing takes time went it's

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:29,930
better then if it's used after 15 years

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:32,459
then if it's not used at all also so

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,190
yeah it's something for my background

00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,930
I'm a physicist by profession I have no

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,680
idea about biology

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:45,540
idea about physics no idea about method

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,029
medicine I just I'm just able to do

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:52,619
packaging I have a technical background

00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:55,559
I can do coding some programming

00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:59,069
languages but I need the input of the

00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:03,949
biologists if say they say this program

00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:08,970
makes sense this is helpful for me and

00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:15,649
yeah so I'm not using the software I'm

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:19,559
just building the packages so this is

00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:25,410
another interesting thing I'm very proud

00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:27,540
about because since 2012 I'm running a

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:33,600
so-called project mentoring of the

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:38,629
months it means for one month some

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:42,360
student who wants to learn packaging can

00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:44,759
ask any question what there are no

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,279
really stupid question but questions the

00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:51,059
student might consider possibly stupid

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,749
stupid can be asked and I will answer

00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:57,240
and help to learn packaging it's I

00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:59,579
require this question all in public on

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,179
the mailing list because other people

00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:06,290
will probably learn from it meant if the

00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:09,559
same questions can learn from it so I

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,929
this is a same number of people who

00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:15,059
finally made this mentoring of someone

00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:19,949
who sees it's not every month three or

00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:21,839
four per year and I also recorded if the

00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:24,749
package was finally uploaded which was

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,679
not really the case for all of them

00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:32,069
plate stopped at some point in time and

00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:35,100
not all of the mentees really remained

00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:38,189
indian-made so which I would love to

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,920
have them better right here but anyway

00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:46,100
we have some people who keep on working

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:47,850
on this who keep on contributing and

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,420
finally

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:54,240
if we don't actively approach newcomers

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,459
and begin nobody but we've got some

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,440
people you will choose this effort and

00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:04,740
I'm quite proud of it and you try to

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:07,889
continue this so not only because of

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,839
this effort but also because we we try

00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,670
to reach out to people with it's his

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,550
prints

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:18,899
Divya mid-project attracted one even

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:22,019
developer per year so if you well what

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:24,149
what's deviant meat inside say who will

00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,670
Debian project if you would assume

00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:29,490
Debian we wouldn't exist even would be

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:32,459
most probably the same because Debian is

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,529
a very universal system it doesn't

00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:36,839
matter if it has some medical

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,699
applications or not on biology because

00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:43,110
no not maybe it's about her she's a

00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:45,420
little bit happy but because the project

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:51,089
exists we attracted some people of this

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:53,370
field and I'm well kind of preaching

00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:56,449
every year that more people try to

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:59,130
follow the the idea we are the

00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:59,550
wealthiest one of us are now doing a

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,430
good job

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:05,189
pansy geographers also doing it got a

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:08,430
good job too to follow the similar route

00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:12,500
and attract more people so if you

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:16,980
imagine that we in this very unimportant

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:19,139
project in sahaja beyond gathered more

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:24,980
than one percent of the Debian

00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:28,259
developers this is quite a lot since

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,649
nineteen of these developers confirmed

00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:34,819
that they are only TVR developers

00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:39,389
because the pyramid project exists and

00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:40,980
we have about I need to check some

00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:47,100
statistics how many deviant developers

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:50,670
we have so this is quite some some good

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:55,199
statistics for this kind of odds are a

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:58,230
product product and even ten of the 19

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,930
above extended activity so they work now

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,390
in different field

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:05,779
of Debian they came over Debian mid and

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:08,360
now are doing something else and 14 of

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:13,700
them keep on to being active inside the

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:18,320
unit the conclusions of this mental

00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:20,029
effort is that the time I spent to

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,589
mentor people as really well worth the

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:26,240
effort and since I have found it's not

00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:30,709
every month that said I have a student

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,510
develop is beautiful for me and the good

00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:37,000
thing is the students are reading

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:39,740
current documents and since I have read

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,560
documents about 20 years ago so when I

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,750
became a developer I can even learn from

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,149
the students because they ask me

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,640
question and this document is I can find

00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:53,630
this and ah that's interesting we have

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:58,880
done something and the major advantage

00:15:53,630 --> 00:16:02,839
is that we are usually teaching absent

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,779
developers of some energy code also and

00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:09,230
they know the software they have written

00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:13,070
and we know work out a package and so we

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:14,900
prove the knowledge and at least 50% of

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,529
these students have strong connection to

00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:21,709
our dream I love sim self upstream or

00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:24,260
sitting in the next office also so then

00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:27,140
we also are doing some software

00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,959
liberation which means a lot of upstream

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:33,080
have no idea about how to find a popular

00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:35,839
at license and so and he have some wiki

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,480
page wherever you just put a record if

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,680
we approach some authors please use a

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:45,140
free license for yourself and B we have

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:49,900
one part of this table has success where

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:52,940
we convince all those one on table is

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:57,230
showing the current process which links

00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,880
to the mayor's we have and so is this is

00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,550
talk is online so you don't need to

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,699
write on this link you can turn

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,959
click on this it's confined it I show

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:10,730
the link later

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,890
yeah so far what I'm also like to say is

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,319
some very proud that we are will team

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:18,620
and I found this team their definition

00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,929
by by my working in the Debian meet him

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,730
since and for me it's a team if I wake

00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:24,740
up in the morning and realized that

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,860
somebody else has solved the problem I

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,290
was not able to save so if yesterday and

00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:35,030
I really experienced this it was I was

00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:36,740
sitting in Saturday night's midnight on

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,240
a problem I was unable to solve I've

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,830
wrote an email to the list and then I

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,900
opened my laptop on the next morning

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,940
someone said no I solved your problem

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,740
that's that's really cool this is this

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:49,000
is the experience I wish that everybody

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:52,730
could have I really like to share this

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,860
so if we want to make some notes for

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:58,040
today

00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:00,380
somebody could fire up this if you

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,400
install a copy and go to this address

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:07,460
and we can do some notes if you have

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,550
some notes maybe we are really a few I

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:13,160
expected and obvious to the end of mine

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,870
here but she has probably not yet

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,950
arrived I don't know what's wrong

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:26,419
because she's from biologist from Russia

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:29,450
and it's not here so if not I can put it

00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:31,790
right on on the screen again yeah this

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,640
is this is impressive impossible all of

00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:39,800
my slides here you can find all my talks

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:42,800
including this one with the PDF and ya

00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:47,840
know I can open this for discussion

00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:50,720
maybe we put one mic to you and you ask

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,030
questions and I try to answer

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:58,250
we are not many we don't need to stretch

00:18:53,030 --> 00:19:00,679
the time into eternity but yeah please

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,990
take the mic maybe you introduce

00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:10,530
yourself as a biologist everybody in to

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:13,620
introduce himself and then another mic

00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:16,370
oh yeah

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,370
I got it

00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:35,130
well you say your name and your

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:37,490
profession it is okay you have a name

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,490
Cody

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,640
yes please say your name in the

00:19:45,180 --> 00:20:05,610
banquettes what what's your expectation

00:19:47,640 --> 00:20:07,950
while you are sitting here and yeah and

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:10,650
doing have you heard about Debian made

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,690
before or are you trusted the conference

00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:17,610
and all there's something that might be

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:29,690
interesting for me could you please

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:32,400
speak in the mic okay yeah okay yeah

00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:36,300
maybe you can also introduce you for the

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,960
mic and then you as well and then we we

00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,960
chat a little bit

00:20:46,789 --> 00:21:06,519
I'm okay and you may be as well because

00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:11,269
others might smile watch the stream so

00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:28,059
yes actually I'm here because I want to

00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:31,549
learn okay and my major is hmm

00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:34,609
yeah as I said I personally also don't

00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:39,529
know so much about about medical things

00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:41,690
but I could imagine that your field of

00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:48,559
work could also have some influence in

00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:51,589
into biology maybe you can also use

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,209
artificial antedate intelligence to do

00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:58,119
some gene sequencing also do you know

00:21:53,209 --> 00:22:08,139
applications which are doing this in

00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:14,049
years actually many more deep learning

00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:18,529
applications in this has many called

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:23,779
image segmentation and which means to

00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:27,109
find the the to find to find something

00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:32,749
strange in many medical pictures such as

00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:36,740
cancer the location of the cancer but

00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:42,860
I'm not familiar with that I mean that

00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:45,529
so maybe I'll talk about it in off that

00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,570
I'm preparing yeah yeah that would be

00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:56,899
interesting

00:22:46,570 --> 00:23:02,149
do we have some responses from IOC no

00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:05,179
response so I don't know what if you

00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:07,279
want to stretch this even more you can

00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:10,520
always approach me we can can do it

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:14,960
directly and yeah I'm hopefully not

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:18,020
scaring you away because maybe some

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,149
little bit favors also I just learned in

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,549
the top before that the haves and the

00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,990
most active applaud I have two thousand

00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:28,700
dollars or figures applaud before this

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:30,980
was all so new to me no but it's a lot

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,539
of stuff because we have India made

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:37,399
about 1,000 packages or more and

00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:40,549
probably and have touched all of them at

00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:43,250
some point in time actually now because

00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:45,289
of the move from from early on to size

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,450
of everything is to touch and I do it

00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:50,990
more or less automatically so it's not

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,760
so it should not be so impressive

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,669
because it's not so much working once

00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:58,460
and once a package exists to update this

00:23:55,669 --> 00:24:00,950
and so it is kind of routine and so good

00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:14,690
but you did you worked at all on the

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:17,330
Linux before or just you can just just

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:20,289
please try talking closer to the

00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,289
microphone okay

00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:39,010
tell me

00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:54,580
maybe we finish the screaming and oh you

00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:57,160
have a question what made you do work on

00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:00,730
the medicine package like your efficacy

00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,500
right so well the singer sets and while

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,900
I'm a physicist I'm working on a

00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,570
medication see tourists in the German

00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,890
who are constituents which face this is

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:14,860
doing research and for the German

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:18,570
Ministry of Health about different

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:21,940
diseases and we are doing yeah we have

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:25,929
also this is gene sequencing stuff is

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:29,110
quite common to find out some some

00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:33,780
issues it in the indices and so it's

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:37,660
quite natural to do all this biology

00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:39,580
stuff and they hire IT persons and if

00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:44,230
you have studied physics and you are

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:48,700
kind of a definition IT person half of

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:52,419
my this of the students of my group are

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:55,929
locally not IT and so I'm just not a

00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:59,559
physicist anymore actually but mighty

00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:05,440
scientists and well it was my motivation

00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:08,590
to say if my Institute mind is time to

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,770
use in US and this should be Debian and

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:14,770
AVL should be really fit for the job

00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:18,850
which we need and this is actually the

00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:22,840
case because most of this stuff which is

00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:25,929
used in my Institute was packaged before

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:29,350
they started using it and what was not

00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:31,059
yet packaged I just did it too not

00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:35,049
completely because something is more

00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:35,380
complex but it's getting better and

00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,290
better

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:41,650
so I'm packaging at request if your

00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:43,700
scientists oppose me and I need this or

00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:48,650
that software then

00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:51,170
and are suing it if I manage with the

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:55,760
help of several people because it in

00:26:51,170 --> 00:27:00,950
fact I need help of several people

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:03,530
inside and I for instance have frequent

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:07,390
trouble and packaging with Yara Sofia

00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:12,530
and I'm asking the TV on Java team and

00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:15,110
it's so it's also what might be

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:17,840
interesting for you and mailing these to

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:20,780
be our mentors even Mentos explains our

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,470
hips how you can solve packaging

00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,190
problems and I'm a frequent poster on

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,610
this list

00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,800
not because I'm answering questions well

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:33,200
sometimes I'm asking but I'm have

00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,440
questions to my fellow Debian developers

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,380
so even if I'm 20 years ago and develop

00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,350
on have done a lot of package thing it's

00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,690
also done by the help of random people

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:47,740
who are helping so this is also an

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:52,640
interesting message I think for you who

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:56,210
are you come out and to get help if you

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,810
know how to find the right channels this

00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:02,330
is also some recommendation I usually

00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:05,570
give in this mentoring of the months

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:09,190
that ask you a question on Debian

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:12,650
mentors I can't answer it myself this is

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:14,870
different it's kind of an experience to

00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:17,570
learn how good this works you write an

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:21,500
email and after a few hours you get an

00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,010
answer it's a solution this is really

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,860
amazing

00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:29,480
also for me every time if I get we have

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:33,910
no of this witch from GCC GCC 7 to GCC 8

00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,910
and some package does not compile and I

00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:41,610
don't understand C++ and EC is okay but

00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:44,250
C++ and if you have a heroin just ask

00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:46,049
there if I cannot find the solution bias

00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,150
if you google Tech gets an answer in a

00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:51,660
couple of hours it can upload the

00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:53,400
package and the fame then goes to me

00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,170
because I have so many package but the

00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:00,350
fame should also go to the people who

00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:04,470
helps realizing this uploads okay yes

00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:15,570
maybe we be finished here there are no

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:18,690
questions you have a question and y'all

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:23,540
actually my cameraman behind and behind

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:26,549
the camera so I'm actually interested if

00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:29,490
if you if you have if if you're

00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:32,340
packaging Everest track is tried is

00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:35,010
mostly into a petty computer some

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,220
compiler come some compounding problems

00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:42,690
that is there are way at him to medical

00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:45,780
yes in it I usually take the ideas

00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:50,309
what's to package from people's work in

00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:53,730
medicine and biology yeah this is in the

00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:56,340
next puff we have about Debian science

00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:59,100
I'm also working deviant science but not

00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,860
so active even science is more trainable

00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,540
by for sure biology is also a science

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,600
and we have common problems that we in

00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:08,460
TV and science we try to find common

00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,620
problems and there are and I'm also

00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,799
helping there because I can sponsor a

00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:17,510
package or some some packages or direct

00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:20,840
dependencies and I upload also this and

00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:24,090
science is a viral umbrella and they are

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,940
packages which parking in any kind

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:29,990
connected to science is the same problem

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,990
in divider

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:47,400
what could be in your piece of gold

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:51,420
speak to the - to talk to the mic

00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:58,950
yeah I don't know what they bnk use in

00:30:51,420 --> 00:31:01,470
hot people you what ah yes well okay

00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:05,190
this is a good question

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:08,400
our plan was that we want to make Divya

00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:10,820
unfit for hospitals I'll show you

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,820
wait a moment

00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,489
we have here the tasks which are part of

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:27,499
TV Amita can also show this and here is

00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:33,710
our hospital information systems and

00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:38,480
this is one one kind of a database which

00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:40,190
is used by by the Vista system which

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:47,119
style has nothing to do with windows

00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:49,399
vista ageism some system to run hospital

00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,830
with all the information that is needed

00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:55,609
and we have at least this database

00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:59,720
system it was actually the first package

00:31:55,609 --> 00:32:01,669
which was done and all it was possible

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,009
because I was running this mental house

00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:06,559
a month while because it's a little bit

00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:10,820
complex to package this little bit it is

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:12,440
complex to package and so I was had

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,799
contact to upstream and upstream

00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:19,489
packages so this database is definitely

00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:23,419
used in hospitals what you see here is

00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:28,539
popcorn zero means nobody's actually

00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:31,639
using this package but I assume if I'm

00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:34,850
install a Debian system in a hospital I

00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:36,980
will not know that the computer is

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,799
falling home to Debian so we don't get

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:43,809
the information if it's really used so I

00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:46,249
expect that it's used but I have no no

00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:49,700
channel.thank that somebody says yeah we

00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:53,989
are using it so I assume it's used it's

00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:59,149
probably not used in many hospitals the

00:32:53,989 --> 00:33:06,799
plan was that we also packaging vista

00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:08,929
itself this is a system and we have the

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,499
material package not yet available but

00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:19,100
we did some preparation

00:33:11,499 --> 00:33:21,710
it's incredible complex to do and yeah I

00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:25,639
have so strategy to how us at first

00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:29,269
low-hanging fruits and I need somebody

00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:31,510
who really really test this I can throw

00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:34,840
a package flow and

00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,660
I can 20 tested in hospital no this

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:42,670
doesn't work so we need some cooperation

00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:45,340
partner and I my idea about a B&B is

00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:47,890
that we really cooperate with people

00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:50,800
that are using it and as long as these

00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:53,590
people not approaching us can we work

00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,870
together to finally get this done this

00:33:53,590 --> 00:34:03,460
will not happen the hospital is very

00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:05,580
complex what we have is we have medical

00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:11,740
practice systems

00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:15,429
oops there are this is just a small help

00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:19,600
of these three times is you especially

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:22,870
in France it's you can run doctor's

00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:26,380
practice here you see seven at least

00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:30,360
seven active installations are using

00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:33,280
this this number is a number of

00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,080
installations which are really used not

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,659
only installed on the computer and then

00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,159
this computer is not used but this is if

00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:42,460
files are really touched

00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:45,760
so these free times is mostly used in

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:51,669
France this in coke attics is something

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:55,780
where you can display images and we have

00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:58,390
new made new meters also I know this new

00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,280
made available you see it we have a

00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:03,940
server which is actively used by in

00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,920
twelve installations and also maybe easy

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,800
client has no connection to the internet

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,640
and all it's not reporting so many so

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,740
these numbers are only estimations

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,380
people some people say you can double

00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,720
the number some people say you can take

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:23,820
ten times the number of popcorn measures

00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:27,370
so we know our packages are used by some

00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:30,760
users what you see definitely we hit in

00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:33,700
the puffs before they had some games

00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,310
packages which have the number of 1000

00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,170
so it's very more games are used by more

00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:40,060
people right we have a very specific

00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:43,960
field but we have used

00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:46,540
we have active users and if you look

00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:49,300
into priority because we will be wrong

00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:52,120
priorities so we can can feel the time a

00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:55,840
little bit with this information we have

00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:58,480
from five or not packages in this year

00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:02,350
so you can look here

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:06,220
maybe if for instance you this one this

00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:11,110
I don't know how deep you are this but

00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:13,690
all these this information here is from

00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:17,590
the package description it is usually

00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:19,240
translated I have the German look here

00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,480
if you you see this is translated this

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:25,680
is under standards this is to be to be

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,360
translated and then if you are a

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,190
biologist you could say oh I can

00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,990
translate and yet you click the

00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:37,530
translate button and then you can do

00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:42,060
this for Chinese we can just know

00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:46,990
because you are here you use Chinese

00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:56,080
what's is it is this one please

00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:58,810
help me don't write this one so we check

00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:03,690
if we have Chinese translations we are

00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:03,690
looking here not yet

00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:15,880
it looks all very English no unusual

00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:17,740
characters for me so it looks not so

00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,350
good but I can explain more what we have

00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:25,750
we have for instance you'll see

00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:30,310
situations this is also a TV on main

00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:35,740
team has started because the idea is if

00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:39,460
we package the code of some authors the

00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:41,110
outdoors gets some additional some

00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,420
additional goggle hits if say I

00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,820
mentioned on our page so they need our

00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,520
it's interesting for them if we package

00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:51,970
and then they help us to package so it's

00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:55,750
I have I'm very keen on that we have

00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:58,570
every package has situations and we have

00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:02,470
also quite new these tools there are

00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:04,330
some registries for biotech registry

00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:07,510
entry so you can click on it so this

00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:10,390
this should be a network of of all the

00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:13,030
applications that's even this kind of

00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:15,910
entry point for free software I made it

00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:19,870
in medicine boundary we have also some

00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:23,680
screenshots but not so much here we have

00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:25,930
screenshots we had such this medical

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:29,560
imaging there are naturally more

00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:31,290
snapshots or more screenshots there's a

00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:35,740
snapshot signing screen shows you know

00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:38,500
here's something this is so not so

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:43,060
amazing it's just a text interface so if

00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:45,880
you have some if you are using some

00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:53,050
applications please make a screenshot

00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:55,930
and submit it here you can upload a

00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:58,270
screenshot and then it goes into the

00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,610
Debian infrastructure it's not just for

00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,770
this page but it goes into the Debian

00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:07,990
infrastructure such one is available for

00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:10,630
all packages so you have you have a list

00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:12,490
you can also see here I have the

00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,330
information that is some new upstream

00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,550
version

00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:19,850
that means for the developer is

00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,330
something to do I need to do the picket

00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:25,540
ring

00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:29,300
I could even you're five minutes left I

00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:31,940
can even show what what work it's done

00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,770
for the packaging yeah maybe I do this

00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,100
and you have five minutes left is

00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,100
correct

00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:58,730
I know that the package flex bar has a

00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:03,620
new upstream version what I'm doing then

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:11,600
is I have made a script it just calls or

00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:13,640
I update it repository GBP to see if

00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,810
somebody some other deviant developer

00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,520
has perhaps committed something those up

00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:29,030
to date and then I have a script which

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:31,570
is called row and then I wait this doing

00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:35,330
some stuff download his new version

00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:38,840
adapting stuff and if I'm lucky and the

00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:43,010
new version has no big changes I can

00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:50,110
upload so doing a new package is not

00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:53,570
necessarily a lot of work it's now

00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:57,530
creating change food environment where

00:40:53,570 --> 00:41:00,230
the package will be built and if I need

00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:02,630
I do not need to refresh some petrus and

00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:05,870
the end of this talk it's ready and I

00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:08,540
can upload it's not so much work so this

00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:14,060
amazing number of 2000 packages I

00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:14,840
uploaded is sometimes frustrating not

00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:19,070
all the time

00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:23,900
I can enjoy but in its frequently you

00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:27,640
just like this yeah do we have more

00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,640
questions while this is morning

00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:39,860
I was compiling yeah what else can I do

00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:39,860
you are from Taiwan typing

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,019
and you are new are you also interested

00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:51,180
in this topic or how your father next

00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:55,000
for this deviant science know if you

00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:56,680
gentlemen after you so you are

00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:06,789
interested in deviant meat or deviant

00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:09,150
science that you introduce yourself with

00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:09,150
a mic

00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:38,840
it is switched off maybe it's suitable

00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:43,780
see use it do you see the green light in

00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,780
the sense since

00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:48,950
okay we'd be totally over that about

00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:53,720
this so you need to see the package is

00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:55,670
new the it's Lydian tells me this

00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,280
package has not yet a all topic again

00:42:55,670 --> 00:43:02,089
test which is not good because we try to

00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:07,609
apply this to every package and it also

00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:12,260
says that I should possibly I usually

00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:14,869
fix this is a packaging detail but since

00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:19,930
the time is running out on I do it later

00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:25,970
I can just tell you what this did its

00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:28,609
lock made here this was written I

00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:31,490
checked out I got the new upstream

00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:33,440
version downloaded which is recorded

00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,450
here I've said the latest standard

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,880
version and it was the only needed

00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:41,589
change then it's an upload too unstable

00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:44,720
and the check is set and thought I could

00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:47,660
now push my changes and upload the

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,539
package this was all this so I have not

00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:55,250
really done a lot of stuff right to gets

00:43:50,539 --> 00:44:03,340
a new version packaged any questions for

00:43:55,250 --> 00:44:06,860
this oh we just finish here

00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:11,840
okay thank you for the attendance

00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:11,840
