One of DebConf’s recurring activities is the Key Signing Party. It helps Debian strengthen and expand its web of trust. This session will:

• Explain how keysigning is done in a DebConf setting

• Validate the SHA256 hash of the KSP coordination document

• Explain how to participate to people who did not send their keys in time

Note: It is strongly recommended for interested people to [read the Wiki page on our keysiging party/process](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf18/Keysigning) beforehand!

	00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:12,530
okay so it seems we're ready okay this

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,690
is usually a short session although I

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,260
know that mostly for people who are

00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:21,710
newcomers a there's a lot of questions

00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:24,470
to be to be answered and most of the

00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:27,440
questions I will tell you in advance the

00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:30,950
answer it completely depends on you and

00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:34,730
on your personal policies but the thing

00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:37,970
is we want to like kick start the

00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:42,140
protocol that we have laid out in order

00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:44,450
to increase the trust inside our network

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:48,380
and to get more people connected to the

00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:56,090
day to the network inside a large

00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:58,550
keyring so well there we can later at

00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:03,469
some other moment discuss the importance

00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:08,149
of having a trust about a keyring for us

00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:11,270
a a what we're going to do here is

00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:13,490
basically to to start a to do the

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,069
necessary steps so we we know there is a

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,909
trust level document from which we can

00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:23,539
start exchanging fingerprints a note

00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:26,079
that many people do not have their keys

00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:28,639
in this document it's completely valid

00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,249
to exchange fingerprints with everybody

00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:32,959
not in this document if I have for

00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:36,079
example a little card that has my

00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,840
fingerprint on it it's at least as good

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,090
as having it in the document if I give

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,880
you a card you know who I am

00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,340
you trust my identity and I'm giving you

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,789
my fingerprint well it's as good as if I

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:53,659
told you that that the pages were going

00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:55,899
to check our valid so what we're going

00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:59,389
to do well first of all I have to

00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:01,939
apologize because I had to come up with

00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:05,090
a set of scripts that I didn't know that

00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:07,520
were already written and available so I

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,399
parsed the best way I could all of the

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,210
fingerprints you all sent me and I know

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,190
I did several mistakes so some some

00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,940
people's keys didn't make it to the

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,240
signing parties time

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,700
and well and the the format is not

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,090
exactly in the in the way that some

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,070
tools like it but the the thing is I

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,050
sent out the announcements and the files

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,040
are there and they I cannot change and

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,770
so we we have to work with what we have

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:41,790
secondly I made a mistake with the date

00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:43,770
so we were supposed to check the shah's

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:47,910
ohms and print the files before

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:50,010
traveling to Taiwan but turns out that

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,290
it was not possible because the

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:56,670
deadlines I had set was for yesterday or

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:59,840
today not two days ago so I split the

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:05,730
key signing party in tufa in two files

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:09,750
we have yep we have a first listing and

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:12,120
the second listing so when when you

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:18,960
exchange keys with somebody say I will

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:22,980
open here the first one you will say I

00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:27,959
am on listing one and my number is 23

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,160
listing one number 23 I have checked it

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,959
yes I have checked it

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,910
have you checked yours yes you have

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,850
checkers is everything correct yes

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,980
everything is correct then we make a

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:43,020
little cross here and a little cross

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:47,580
here and yay but we have to ensure that

00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:51,360
we all have the same documents so among

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:57,050
you all who has computed the finger - ah

00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:00,480
the sha-256 sum for the first listing

00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:04,530
okay a good number for the second

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,290
listing great more than enough - to get

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,630
started those who have not well you can

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:13,709
trust the rest of us or you can of

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:16,140
course check it yourselves so what we're

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:23,150
now going to do is it would be very

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:26,580
boring if I did the reading a I will

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:30,350
unplug my computer a bit or well just

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,350
disconnect the output and I will

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,129
ask those of you that have it to read it

00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:39,259
like one octet at once right so you and

00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:40,430
me can check it matches and we will

00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:45,439
check among the audience I'm

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:47,960
disconnecting so well it's verified

00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:53,060
among many and not just by looking at

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:58,969
our screen so here in this list that

00:04:53,060 --> 00:05:02,259
that I put for you the the Chateau 56 is

00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:09,460
available here but please don't sit now

00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:13,340

please continue okay we have group Olli

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:44,750
confirmed our first file and and if you

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,870
don't believe it

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:50,290
well you can check here and they I have

00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,470
signed it and I have checked it in blah

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:55,130
okay

00:06:51,470 --> 00:07:01,190
and now please let's do the second one

00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:01,940
same procedure I will start for the

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,730
second one

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,730
II see f5

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,780
7b II see

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,360
zero e0f

00:07:46,060 --> 00:08:00,630
five b37 okay great

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:08,490
this is somebody here scratching their

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,780
heads asking what we just did or we can

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:16,000
yeah great okay

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:19,590
what is this a I want each of you to be

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,470
sure that the file I am giving you

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:28,030
contains the right fingerprints and it's

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:32,080
not it doesn't contain garbage yeah

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:34,900
because I want you to sign balance a key

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,880
and the Chang was key and each of the

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:44,560
keys that are there if we don't group

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:47,470
Ali check this I may be injecting things

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,510
into here I may be trying to assume

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,180
somebody else's identity and getting

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:56,250
connected into the web of trust so you

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,250
can get this a file

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
and

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:18,850
get this fingerprint and compare it to

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:22,690
the one I have here that we just checked

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,640
and it should be exactly the same I'm

00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,820
not going to do it again because I trust

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,490
it I put it there right but the thing is

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:34,720
a it's very important for for our

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:37,330
project we collectively well each of us

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,150
as a developer we have root access to

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:44,320
millions of computers if we upload the

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:46,930
wrong software a it's liable to do cause

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,930
a lot of damage so this is the the way

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:52,320
we can assign trust to the actions each

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:58,150
of us do right

00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:01,030
so it's important to to well to trust

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:04,660
enough the identity of each person we

00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:08,650
are cross signing with again if you

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,320
didn't bring if you didn't put your if

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,730
these files don't include your

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,250
fingerprint please use something like

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:19,630
this or you slips of paper yes please

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:29,170
Tomas way to the microphones not yet

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:32,170
open right very very very important yep

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,600
everybody should check double check

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:38,020
their own fingerprint with the file

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,000
this means that how do I check this well

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:47,610
the good thing is that I have a full

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:51,550
auditorium to help me here is my own and

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:53,740
I have here my piece of paper so if I

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:59,890
read this and you check that it's the

00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:09,070
same a B for 1 C 1 C 6 8 AF D 6 6 8 C a

00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:11,950
0 4 5 EB F 8 7 6 7 3 a 0 3 E 4 C 1 DB 9

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,500
2 1 F that is verifying my own

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,750
fingerprint each of you that has their

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,300
fingerprints here should check that

00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,790
where that I didn't inject something in

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,440
this or somebody injected a mail to me

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,290
too

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:33,420
Corral to make your fingerprint corrupt

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:36,750
right a so well of course yours your

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:40,800
sink here some garbage I see like here

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:43,649
please remember this file is for text

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,319
encoding Unicode specially important

00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:49,439
here because for example here we have a

00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:55,439
name a Korean name that would not

00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:59,660
display otherwise so please any any

00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:59,660
questions anything we should add to this

00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:07,949
yeah so I think we can declare the key

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,060
signings this is the key signing

00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:15,209
sessions to be open each and every one

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:20,430
of us is available for cross signing

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:22,670
keys so please be gentle and and they

00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:30,080
have fun

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:30,080
[Applause]

00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,390
a before I forget one more thing it's

00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,810
very useful to have these sheets printed

00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:03,550
that's the reason why we created all

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:11,560
song and I think the volume went up we

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:15,130
also had these we had this short list

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:20,110
that instead of printing I think it's

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:25,000
like 18 pages you can just print up okay

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:32,260
we'll come welcome okay the short list

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:36,700
here a print seal in four pages which

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:40,270
you can print front them back the full

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:43,030
list only the most important parts so

00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,740
this is enough for checking if you did

00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:51,280
all the checks on the other end on the

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:54,760
regular files a where to print we I try

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,100
to print copies for people to grab but

00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,610
it's quite expensive so I I didn't

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:03,400
a in the you can go to the convenience

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:06,220
stores inside the campus it's I think it

00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,490
was three Taiwanese dollar per sheet so

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:12,820
it would be four times that I was told

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,890
it can be cheaper if we go out here to

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,980
the Main Street there several printing

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,060
centers so I think these four sheets can
