One of DebConf’s recurring activities is the Key Signing Party. It helps Debian strengthen and expand its web of trust. This session will:

• Explain how keysigning is done in a DebConf setting

• Validate the SHA256 hash of the KSP coordination document

• Explain how to participate to people who did not send their keys in time

Note: It is strongly recommended for interested people to [read the Wiki page on our keysiging party/process](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf18/Keysigning) beforehand!
