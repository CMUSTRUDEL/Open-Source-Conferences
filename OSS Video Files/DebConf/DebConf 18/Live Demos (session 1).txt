all right hi I'm poor and I want to talk

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:15,110
to you about spam I work on a program

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:18,110
called IMAP spam be gone is BG and the

00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:21,590
idea beyond is BG is that sometimes you

00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,280
have a mailbox somewhere and you don't

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,530
control it

00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,200
so your RSP runs the mailbox that you

00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,440
like you're going to company and they

00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,419
run a mailbox for you when you don't

00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,760
have control over it and there's Pam

00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:35,840
filter is really bad so you don't have

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,640
control over the span and you're

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,210
receiving all the spam that you don't

00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,489
want well is BG fixes that what it does

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,010
it that's you run your own spam assassin

00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:48,320
server and you're connecting through

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,690
IMAP to that mailbox and filtering your

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,790
spam locally with your own spam assassin

00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:57,230
server and then classifying that spam

00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:58,730
through IMAP so it's a it's a Python

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,160
script that was written ten years ago

00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,559
and then it's evolved I've been

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,380
maintaining this for maybe three or four

00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,810
years now and I have a live demo of it

00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,679
working here we're just going to wait

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,679
for this to go away

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:22,069
hey well okay so you can see here I'm

00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:25,119
running is BG with the delete and

00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:27,679
expunge I'm apps flags so we're telling

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,439
that we want to delete the spam and

00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:32,749
expunge it so these are two common IMAP

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,109
filters and then I'm passing it to the

00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:37,849
I'm at house I'm using I'm saying this

00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:39,649
is my IMAP

00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:41,479
well this is my mailbox this is my

00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:44,389
username for this I'm using this for

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,249
tests mainly then telling it where the

00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:48,950
inbox is where the spam box is and

00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:51,109
telling it to run in verbose mode so it

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,729
runs and assistant it's in verbose it's

00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:56,810
gonna tell us a bunch of stuff that you

00:01:52,729 --> 00:02:01,909
normally won't seen just starts and it's

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:05,119
starting to tell you it looks for IMAP

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:06,799
IDs of these messages to keep FAQ of

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,810
them so there's a track file that keeps

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,550
track of all the emails that seen so it

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,440
doesn't run again and again and again on

00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,210
the same messages and then you can see

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,140
it's the it's fetching this message so

00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,610
this is one is it the thousand 92

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,800
and then it gives us core for it this is

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,720
a spamassassin score based on the basin

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,830
filter so it goes through a bunch of

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,710
them by default is BG runs in batches of

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,120
50 so you can change that but it's nice

00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,520
you're on a cron job when it runs like

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,210
each five minutes and checks for all the

00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:42,650
50 messages it hasn't seen and see we've

00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:46,580
just discovered a spam here with a score

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,080
of 101 on five so this is my own spam

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,260
assassin server with their own filters

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,180
I've set and yeah it's giving it spam

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,360
and it's gonna continue like this for a

00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:00,980
while looking through various emails and

00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:06,350
at the end it expunges all the spam it's

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:09,320
found let's go back to this so it

00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,510
expenses although the spam it's found it

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,350
so it tells you we found eight pounds

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:18,770
and 50 messages and then it logs out so

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:21,770
that is basically it is our is BG it's

00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:24,020
on github and it's on pi PI sadly it's

00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,720
not on indie vignette maybe one day

00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:37,370
we'll but that that's it yeah why is BG

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:43,450
my rest time you going I don't know if

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,450
there's other person yeah

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:29,960
I know it when I see you I don't see

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,960
anything

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:42,399
oh there's nothing okay

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,399
[Music]

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,670
so I'm I don't mess around and just move

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,570
the windows to the other screen I hope

00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:04,950
that that works so what I want to show

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:07,830
is something that happened oh yeah sorry

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,840
I'm Matthias Klum I am mostly the

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,970
upstream maintainer so as soon as the

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,490
metadata format for software components

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,730
and yeah I work on gnome and KDE stuff

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,160
and yeah a bunch of other things and

00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:23,250
yesterday I actually read back report

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,380
from someone who complained that in the

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,390
genome Software Center the funds weren't

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,810
actually showing in the right language

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:33,780
so some funds that were in an Indian

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,220
script were just showing with Latin

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,920
letters and therefore looking at least

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,260
so I fixed that back and meanwhile Ian

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,590
Lane was looking at my shoulder and saw

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,720
that every single font rendering had

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:49,140
standard Mangrum a quick brown fox jumps

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,000
over the lazy dog which is demo text

00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,040
that shows all the letters in the

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,630
English alphabet to the user so they can

00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,300
evaluate whether the fondest rate or not

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,770
so and this is quite boring so he asked

00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,720
whether it was possible to just have

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,170
more pangrams

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,360
so I just last night implemented a

00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,220
pangram randomizer which was selected if

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,860
and pangram depending on the font family

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,230
that's that's going to be displayed and

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,390
as yeah it's deterministic in that it

00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:21,540
always uses the same pangram for the

00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:24,300
same font family name but it's also okay

00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,240
yeah so it's it's deterministic in a way

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,970
that it uses the same pangram for the

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,010
same fun family all the time but it uses

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,100
a different pangram for a font family

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:38,100
and I would love to actually show that

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,400
so this is no software this is the font

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,680
selection dialog and yeah and these are

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,380
all the fonts you can select and in

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,950
theory if you click on one of those you

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,950
should see

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:25,460
so that's loud so unfortunately when

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,280
trying to test this we discovered

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,140
another book in gnome software which for

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,990
some odd reason doesn't happen when you

00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,900
run genome suffer around KDE which due

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,120
to the time constraint I couldn't

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,790
actually do right now so instead I will

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,760
just to quickly show you a some results

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,620
show you the pages on the upstream

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,110
generator web pages if I this thing

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,180
that's me so this is the font selection

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,770
place it shows you basically all the

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,080
metadata that the upstream generator

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,990
extracts from the fonts which is the M

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,300
which is like generators screenshots but

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,900
also all the languages that the phone

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,240
supports and now it will generate texts

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,760
like these which contain all the letters

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,340
that the English alphabet has but with

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,140
different sentences instead of like

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:18,230
having the quick brown fox show up all

00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:21,290
the time okay so in soon as soon as we

00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,930
fix that back in software you can also

00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,940
see those in software itself and yeah

00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,800
that's basically it's a quick hack help

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,850
that happened yesterday with a few beer

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,850
so yeah

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:38,180
[Applause]

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,949
hooray and that gets us in right at 17

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,519
20s so thank you very much they will be

00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:44,570
further sessions of live demos on there

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,060
will be one further sessions of live

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,940
demos on Friday and lightning talks will

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,800
happen on Thursday and this session only

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,570
if you have questions of the speakers

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,690
please to address them directly thank

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,690
