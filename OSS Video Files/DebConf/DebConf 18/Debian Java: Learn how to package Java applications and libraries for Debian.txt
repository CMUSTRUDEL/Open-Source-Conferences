You are beginning to learn more about Debian packaging and one of your favorite programming languages is Java. You are already an experienced maintainer or packager but you are unfortunate enough having to package some Java app and you don't know how to start. Never heard of Ant, Maven and Gradle? Then this presentation will hopefully help you to get started quickly by introducing you to the most important Java build systems and methods to make them Debian compliant.

This talk is about learning by examples. It will highlight some Java applications and libraries that are already in Debian and demonstrate what you need to do to deliver your own package to your users. I will also talk about some common Java specific packaging errors and how you can avoid them.
