Projects like Debian can only exist in a connected world, but the immense increase in communication capability of the Internet also has a dark side.  The same capabilities that enable intense technical collaboration across immense distances also make it possible for negative voices to be amplified.

This session will be a panel discussion featuring some well-known, long-time contributors to Debian who are willing to share their experiences and advice on how to remain focused on what's important.  Criticism is vitally important to Debian, but developers need to be able to extract the constructive elements from public discussions.  Hopefully, the content of this session will help!
