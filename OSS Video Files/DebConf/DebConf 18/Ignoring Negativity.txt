Projects like Debian can only exist in a connected world, but the immense increase in communication capability of the Internet also has a dark side.  The same capabilities that enable intense technical collaboration across immense distances also make it possible for negative voices to be amplified.

This session will be a panel discussion featuring some well-known, long-time contributors to Debian who are willing to share their experiences and advice on how to remain focused on what's important.  Criticism is vitally important to Debian, but developers need to be able to extract the constructive elements from public discussions.  Hopefully, the content of this session will help!

	00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:10,760
and now I would like to interview very

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:15,219
special panel discussion here today with

00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:25,960
the people that we all know we have here

00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:25,960
video Gabby chrislam

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:45,880
say MacIntyre in Andy Cassini very very

00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:51,670
interesting topic ignoring the Capitan

00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:53,830
negativity well done thank you so good

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,100
afternoon everyone welcome to DEFCON 10

00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:59,530
to Taiwan interesting little fact I was

00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,200
commenting on in a panel discussion the

00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,089
other day fun fact that people may not

00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,970
know about me despite all the crazy

00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:08,860
traveling I did during my years as a

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,110
corporate executive this is actually the

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,970
first time I've ever visited Taiwan it's

00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,830
been a lot of fun so far so thanks to

00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:18,759
everyone for being here and for having

00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:20,290
the conference here this session is you

00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,420
know the title may seem a little bit

00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,550
weird what happened is a few months ago

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,710
there was another one of those things

00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,810
that happens fairly routinely in Debian

00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,180
somebody posted a message on one of our

00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,520
mailing lists that a few of us who were

00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,170
chatting on IRC immediately reacted to

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,030
you by saying oh my god this is going to

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,509
generate another one of those long nasty

00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,100
threads that Nautilus liked to read and

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,780
Steve I in particular started sort of

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,090
trading thoughts back and forth about

00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,360
you know how do how have we figured out

00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,520
how to not get really depressed and

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,770
still be able to do productive useful

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,319
work for the project when that sort of

00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,470
thing happens and somebody else who is

00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,459
around it might have been in Rico even

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,610
hooked us and said you know that would

00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:05,530
make a good Def Con talk and so that's

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,479
where this sort of came from I'm really

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,819
pleased that Chris and Enrico and Steve

00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:13,209
have all agreed to join me and try and

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:16,530
convey some useful learnings and

00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:19,150
experiences from our personal

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,459
participation in Debian and the roles

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,560
that we've played not to try and help

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:26,260
everyone else here and everybody who's

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,970
watching the video stream understand how

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,670
it is that we can go for a very long

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:34,360
time contributing to Debian without

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,069
going completely nuts before we dive

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,409
into this out of curiosity how many of

00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:40,500
you in the room are at your first Def

00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:45,290
Con

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,290
that's exciting thank you for being here

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:57,930
how many of you have been to five or

00:02:49,110 --> 00:03:02,490
more Deb comes 10 or more 15 or more has

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:05,100
anybody else been to 17 in a row shelf

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,960
yeah I had to show up that's that's one

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,360
of the few stats about me that's also

00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,190
probably sort of interesting here look

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
to sort of frame things a little bit

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,120
what what we're gonna do is I'm gonna

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,980
provide just a tiny bit of context to

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,140
sort of explain what we do and don't

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,510
want to try and cover in this session

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,040
and then we're gonna sort of pass the

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,580
mic round and each of these fine

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,880
individuals will convey some wisdom or

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,320
thoughts in this topic area and then

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,390
after we've had a chance to do that

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,190
assuming there's still time available

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,110
which I think there will be will be

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,720
happy to feel questions and we'll see if

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,459
we can't help in some way to make it

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,120
possible for all of us to be more

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,709
productive and happier contributors to w

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,940
so first of all I want to make it clear

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,890
that this session is not about

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,690
harassment

00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:54,780
when we talk about ignoring negativity

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:58,410
we are absolutely not talking about

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,769
tolerating actual harassment of anybody

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,820
in the project that's unreasonable and

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,730
we would never go there

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,040
but they're an awful lot of actions and

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,890
behaviors by individuals in the project

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,010
that are frustrating or irritating to

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,209
other people but don't really rise to

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,130
the level of something that would be

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,739
appropriate to consider harassment and

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,530
yet some of those things can be really

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,590
depressing so what this session is about

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,479
is you know trying to help convey things

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,490
that we think we've learned about how

00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,070
you can be a long-term productive

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,440
contributor to a project like this where

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,450
all of us who are here are intensely

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,450
passionate about what we're doing and

00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:42,330
that passion causes us to often be very

00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:45,360
outspoken and to have very strongly held

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,979
opinions and so if you're going to try

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,680
and operate in this sort of environment

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,810
you have to figure out how to feel good

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,760
about what it is that you're doing

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,310
and the contributions you're making the

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,139
project even if not everything going on

00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,610
around you is something that makes you

00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,020
feel good and in fact there may be

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,700
things happening elsewhere in the

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,300
project in any given moment that make

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:09,389
you feel really bad and I hope in the

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,850
process that part of what comes out is

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,820
that you know some of you at least

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,240
recognize things that you've done in the

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,560
past or you've seen other people do that

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,200
unintentionally probably helped to

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,150
create a less positive potentially more

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,590
negative environment for other people

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,350
around you who are trying to contribute

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,910
to the project and hopefully that sort

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,880
of dose of self-awareness makes it

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,880
possible for all of us to focus more of

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,440
our contributions in the project on sort

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,120
of being excellent to each other in

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,190
making this a better environment for

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,160
everybody and not bringing more negative

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,600
energy into the space so that I'm gonna

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,600
hand off which one of you guys would

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:53,700
like to first please

00:05:50,600 --> 00:06:16,570
one of you guys who would like to go

00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:23,240
first okay yeah I guess one I had

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:25,670
to start a conversation is that often it

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:30,380
happens that at work if you're not on

00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:32,560
top of things and you stop paying

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,530
attention to what other people are doing

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,980
chances are that they'll do something

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,560
stupid at least in some work

00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,940
environments whereas in Debian if you

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,850
don't pay attention to whatever people

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,530
are doing and and you're not on top of

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:53,930
things chances are other people will do

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:56,420
something smart but if I applying the

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,870
same thing at work where maybe one is

00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:02,540
like in charge of technical things and

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:06,340
so on in Debian kind of that that sense

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:10,520
of responsibility turns into a

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,230
compulsion of control which really

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,100
doesn't help because the project is way

00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:22,430
too big so there was in a recent flame

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:25,580
or somebody pointed out I can't like

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,780
this thing I can't by being at I've been

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,850
developed where I don't want to be

00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:33,380
associated with this thing and I thought

00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:37,820
well yeah I don't want to be associated

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:40,070
with my sequel but I'm still okay being

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:44,110
a Debian developer even if the appian

00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:51,560
ships my sequel that breaks utf-8 I mean

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:53,870
but it's fine I'm only responsible for

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,840
the things I maintain and and that's

00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,120
where my reputation goes and for the

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,490
rest of that being I let go and I live

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,640
happy but if somebody feels responsible

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,830
for all of that being then

00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,750
responsibility with great powers can

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,790
great responsibilities with great

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:15,890
responsibility comes great control

00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:18,440
sweetness and and then everybody has to

00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,850
have an opinion on everything and the

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,540
project is not sustainable

00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,430
so I guess quite an important thing is

00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,820
to let go

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,440
when there are things that I don't

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,660
understand I'm quite happy that way

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,700
actually there's so many things I don't

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,950
understand in Debian it's amazing how

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:47,700
can it boot on this thing I mean

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:47,700
congratulations to whoever did that yeah

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,190
so the thing I found in the many years

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,360
I've been involved in Debian that

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,310
carrying on from under Rico slightly is

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,440
trying to keep up with it all it's not

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,790
it you know it's the firehose thing

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,820
again that you hear people talk about

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:09,010
but worse back 15 years ago I remember

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,650
trying to read most the mailing lists I

00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:14,230
wasn't necessarily following I wasn't

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,910
with replying to most of it but I wanted

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,430
to see what was going on Debian was

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:21,370
amazing and so diverse and so much good

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,110
stuff was going on and then I realized I

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,180
was running out of time to sleep and

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,740
that didn't do any good for me either

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,930
it meant I wasn't actually doing the

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,550
things I was trying to work on but where

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,570
I wasn't it's a great place to be

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:37,690
so Debian can be such an amazing project

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,120
to be part of because there are so many

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,209
really really intelligent white people

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,680
doing amazing things every day and yet

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,480
it can also be one of the most

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,750
frustrating things or the most

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,300
frustrating places to be when you think

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,580
that oh and I'm holding people up or

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:59,800
there are things I'm not doing that I

00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:01,690
should be doing and and oh I feel bad my

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,910
own involvement has been very cyclically

00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,300
over the years there are times when it's

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,779
on and up and I can be spending I'll be

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,370
honest

00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,050
of course I can talk about this honestly

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,810
because I don't work with those people

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,000
anymore well I spend more time doing

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,250
Debian work than doing paid work

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,339
Alfred not number the years I've been

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,800
around and I felt amazing for it I felt

00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,890
really really rewarded it's been great

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,630
fun there's been lots of achievements

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,910
sometimes there were days when I'm just

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,110
not in the mood I can't I can't cope

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,900
with it you know I've got other things

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,089
to do you know family matters come up

00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,480
I'm just generally just feeling grouchy

00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:40,550
those are the days

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,280
when it's much harder those are the days

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,890
when it is an important thing to

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,230
recognize that I'm not necessarily gonna

00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,690
achieve much directly don't get down

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,880
about it you know move on take the day

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,010
off take take a week off a month off

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,720
it's fine you know

00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,570
the world will move on the world will

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,400
carry on the only thing that really I

00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,350
you know and I've said there's a number

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:07,700
of times to lots of people over over the

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:10,040
years is be prepared to back away be

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,620
prepared to be honest the worst one is

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,170
when you beat yourself up because you

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:18,050
can't because you know you can't admit

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:21,230
to yourself you feel ashamed to admit

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:23,000
that you're struggling there are lots of

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,650
people around people will pick up will

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,780
pick up after you people will help

00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:32,210
people will understand after all we're

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:34,550
all human thanks deep just to scroll

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:37,340
back to your outlying of what this

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:40,070
chocolate isn't isn't about reminds me a

00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:43,130
lot of a categorization of different

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,810
types of conversation in terms of you

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,730
have agreeable conversation perhaps like

00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,460
the one we're having now and then you

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,590
have unacceptable tone of conversation

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,270
which again is not within the remit and

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,460
then there's the disagreeable which is

00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:57,290
the hard the hard classically because

00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,170
the the agreeable is easy because

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,270
whatever you guys and the unacceptable

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,920
is just unacceptable and harassment

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:09,170
would obviously come underneath that and

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,420
it is this middle category of mmm sort

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,520
of yeah so I thought that was quite a

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,620
good when I read that first it was quite

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,810
a good framing for what for putting

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,390
conversations into and for when you are

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:22,400
looking at conversation being able to

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,550
categorize it like such is it can be

00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,650
quite useful um I certainly don't have

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:33,710
any I certainly don't have the

00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:36,500
experience of in terms of time as these

00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,870
fine gentlemen with Debian and

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,550
experiencing negativity there but

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,940
perhaps some of it has been a bit more

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:46,850
as DPL anyway has come a bit more

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,860
privately than on the mailing lists

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,230
and that's underlined how audience

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,839
matters so that speaks to words like

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:57,139
face and respect and things like that

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,180
because a male sent a nasty mail sent

00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,980
privately those different things and

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,589
pushes different buttons than one sent

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,850
publicly I'm not gonna say one is worse

00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:08,899
than the other because you can probably

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:11,000
imagine that one yes I make it up or

00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:13,670
exaggerating for effect but slandering

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,579
you publicly is one thing but one that

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,649
is quite nasty and sent to you directly

00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:21,769
it's clearly designed to needle you

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:24,529
directly it's also unpleasant in its own

00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:27,880
its own way but I have known no answers

00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:30,680
here I mean keeping perspective has been

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:35,509
quite important and educating myself

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:37,550
about human form human brain problems

00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:40,759
and fail fail T's whatever they're

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:43,130
called form the term and but knowing

00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,920
that for example if you receive 100 bits

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,360
of positive feedback you wish but say

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,430
one did receive a hundred bits of

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,470
positive feedback in Debian and then got

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,600
one negative one guess what you're going

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,100
to try and fall asleep to and whilst

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,680
thinking about it's gonna be the

00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,420
negative one and it's gonna be in your

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,560
head all day whilst in the shower and

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:07,189
you're gonna be and there's a whole

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:10,189
class of these just sort of foibles has

00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:13,040
the word foibles in our you know sort of

00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:16,100
fallen Homo Sapien post collapse Aryan

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,209
brains that mean that you do focus on

00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,610
all these negative negative things and

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,259
so which isn't so also not to ruminating

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,990
on the mounds and a sledge already said

00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:29,509
sometimes just step away for that five

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:33,050
minutes five hours five days or five

00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:35,120
weeks that is that it's absolutely fine

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,470
that actually sort of ties in well to

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,930
one of the things I wanted to talk about

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,670
which is that you know our primary means

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,490
of communicating with each other in the

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,589
Debian project is through email I mean

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,019
we use other things to IRC and so forth

00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:49,850
but and certainly face-to-face

00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:51,890
communications at events like Deb conf

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,890
but because so much of our communication

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:58,250
with each other is via email it's very

00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:00,829
easy for people to sort of lose track of

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,570
the way email really ought to work and

00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:04,760
what I mean by that is I've always

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:08,079
thought that the email process was meant

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,880
to be read contemplate than write and

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,800
unfortunately when emotions start to

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,510
crank up you know people rush through

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,160
that first stage skip over the second

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,890
one entirely and spend most of the time

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,980
in the third and when that happens it's

00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,200
really really easy for the energy being

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,300
applied positively or negatively to a

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,269
discussion to escalate really rapidly

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,690
and I've discovered you know myself that

00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:34,810
if I'm really irritated and there's

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,970
something I really feel compelled to say

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:40,220
there's an immense value in dumping it

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,589
all out of my brain into a buffer you

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,089
know an edit buffer or something and

00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:45,380
then not hitting send

00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:47,480
but going away and doing something

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,120
completely different for a while as you

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,589
say detaching a bit and then come back

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,690
and see whether I still feel as

00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,430
passionately about that sometimes I

00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,839
really do but I realize that I could

00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,730
take about three-quarters of the words

00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,589
out of the message and still convey the

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,570
one thing that I really believe that

00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:04,940
would be a useful addition to the

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:08,209
conversation and if you're willing and

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,250
able to take the time to do that all of

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:11,930
a sudden you know it becomes much easier

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,149
to do these things we talked about some

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,360
times of trying to keep the conversation

00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:19,370
focused on the actual technical content

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,930
instead of the personalities of the

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,810
people involved and things like that

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:26,329
and this goes a really long way towards

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,790
making it easier to feel good about

00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:31,450
contributing of the project I also

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:35,540
thought about a couple of other things

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:37,370
because the Debian project is really all

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,120
about this notion that we've made common

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:43,790
cause to create a free operating system

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,590
if you are working to make some sort of

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,640
improvement or contribution to the

00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,710
operating system

00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,180
the most frustrating thing that can

00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,680
happen sometimes is when there's

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,100
something that sort of blocks your

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,920
ability to make progress and sometimes

00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,450
as Steve said that's you know you've

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,940
just got other things going on in your

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,950
life and you lose enthusiasm for a while

00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,870
that's totally okay and when that

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,579
happens you ought to back away but it's

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,040
really good if you let other people

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:13,880
around you in the project know that

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:16,579
you're doing that I sometimes chuckle at

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,740
the number of random vacation messages

00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,959
that show up on places like Debian

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,579
private and it's kind of like why do I

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,740
care that that person is going to have a

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,600
nice vacation on the south of France or

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,850
something but the flipside of that is

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,280
that if you do let the other people that

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:34,040
you work with in the project know when

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,200
stuff is going on in your life so that

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,970
they're not just getting frustrated and

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,610
wondering why you're not responding or

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,520
they feel empowered to go do something

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,560
in your absence then that can help keep

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,860
from sort of blocking people's ability

00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:52,460
to do things I also observed last year

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,230
in the session that where I talked about

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,220
some of the history of the project at

00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:01,040
the Def Con from Montreal that in the

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,100
early days of this project this concept

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,160
of ownership of packages was not quite

00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:10,070
as ingrained as it is today in fact it

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,230
wasn't until at least a year

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,090
year-and-a-half after I joined Debian

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,220
that the whole notion that there was an

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,440
assign the responsible individual for a

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,560
given package got coded into our bug

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,810
tracking and packaging systems and that

00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,430
causes me sometimes to think about you

00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,310
know what's going on

00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,590
when I see people arguing in a thread

00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:34,310
and the bug tracking system about you

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:36,710
know yes I'll do this no I won't and it

00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,150
particularly causes me to think when you

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,429
know somebody has disappeared for a

00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,320
while and other people have something

00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:43,910
that's you know blocking a transition or

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,290
whatever that they'd really like to get

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,640
taken

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,800
care of and they're really concerned

00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,590
about doing a non maintainer upload and

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,660
the whole reason we have processes to do

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,060
things like that is to be able to

00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,100
tolerate this situation where not

00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,350
everybody who's a passionate volunteer

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,600
can be around you know seven days a week

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,850
24 hours a day to make progress on

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,070
things so I don't know if there's any

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,010
any of those really particularly help I

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,710
have to also echo Steve's observation

00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,540
that about 15 years ago specifically the

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,440
year that I was there in project leader

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:19,570
I did subscribe to at the time all 89 of

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,980
Debian's mailing lists and I read every

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,050
message and every one of them every day

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,850
and I have to admit that there were days

00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,130
when that left me with absolutely zero

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,010
energy to do anything productive for the

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:33,280
project and so like many people I have

00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:35,320
completely ratcheted down how many such

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,660
things I try to pay attention to on an

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,370
average day but I'm very very quick when

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,530
somebody makes a reference in an IRC

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,750
channel or drops me an email asking my

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,970
opinion about something to dive in and

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,940
go read you know even the long nasty

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,710
email threads because sometimes you know

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,630
it's necessary to understand what's

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,360
going on and be able to help and make

00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,250
progress but I have discovered that if I

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,080
manage to sort of put the blinders on a

00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,700
little bit and think about the thing

00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,130
that I actually want to get done today

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,190
and sometimes to actually sit down and

00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:08,440
fix the bug before I go dive in and read

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,390
a bunch of mail in less traffic you'd be

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,090
surprised how much more productive work

00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:19,120
you can get done you know before the

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:22,450
whole craziness sets in yeah when you

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,010
mentioned the Mail's and reviewing and

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:28,510
so on you reminded me of a suggestion

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:30,610
Mako gave me there is when you write a

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33,520
mail you you you write a long

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:36,010
explanation for everything and and have

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,500
your point at the bottom and at that

00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,820
point take in the main you're what you

00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,710
wanted to say from the bottom and

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:45,340
putting at the top and then the data

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:47,410
everything else because that by the way

00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,090
is a really good good thing to do also

00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,740
when you're working in big corporations

00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,360
if you're trying to convince your boss

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,740
of something because they generally

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,390
can't read more than three

00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,700
an email before they move on to the next

00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,710
line right and and fair enough they

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,640
probably want to have the time in

00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:07,929
because they need to read gazillion and

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:11,050
and in a way that means that your

00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:13,059
thought process may be he's less

00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:16,720
interesting or I don't know but then the

00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:20,980
thought process kind of hides the point

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,650
and it may and sometimes I would feel in

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,690
doing that that I kind of failed to make

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,290
a convincing argument because I didn't

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:32,800
set the sort of all the discourse it

00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:35,230
leads to that and and it's also that I

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:39,070
think a bit of a control freak eerie so

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:41,950
I mean I'm not actually I don't have the

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,380
power to control the thoughts of the

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:47,170
people reading the email so in the end

00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,300
it's the point I'm trying to make that

00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:51,990
may resonate with the thought process I

00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:55,240
had or somebody else's thought process

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,130
but there's something like when I send

00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,920
an email to add a big mailing list I

00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,840
mean no pressure right it's only going

00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:07,090
to be read by thousands of people and

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:09,340
archived by Google forever so somehow my

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,470
reputation is linked to it and there's

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,190
people with extremely high reputations

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:18,250
writing in those lists so yeah I mean

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:21,580
find just click send but I really am

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:25,240
trying to force myself to say I don't

00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:27,550
know this thing and it's okay there's an

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,420
illusion of perfection because there's

00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:34,150
so much perfection going on in Debian

00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,550
like technical like the faction doesn't

00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,380
exist and that mean is not perfect but

00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,440
there's a lot of technical excellency

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:45,490
and extremely knowledgeable people

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:48,940
hanging around in Debian so yeah it's

00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,980
totally ok to get something wrong it's

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,679
totally okay to not know something it's

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,929
totally okay to write saying hey you

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,950
changed my mind you made a good point

00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:02,860
that doesn't it feels like a loss of

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,740
control it feels like you're not the

00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:08,059
smartest smartest person in the room it

00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,759
feels like

00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:14,120
people will read that message 10 years

00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:17,779
later and won't hire you for the job but

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,580
actually a what it really feels like is

00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:22,340
that you are a human being who is able

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,980
to think which is probably something

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:28,309
positive for the reputation but I think

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,710
there's no narrative for that in Debian

00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:35,179
it doesn't happen usually and so the

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:37,519
examples that are set are sort of not

00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:43,639
leading in that way but I would totally

00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:46,820
like to see more of that some people the

00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:48,679
fact that you know we produce a

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,809
technically excellent operating system

00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,549
yet if you look behind the scenes you

00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:54,649
see all the rubbish that goes on you see

00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:56,899
people's mistakes we air all of our

00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:58,789
dirty laundry all the time and sometimes

00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:02,539
that can get people down but

00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:04,279
fundamentally and enough I've made this

00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:07,850
argument to friends a few times over the

00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:11,179
years Debian produces not quite exists

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:14,419
am almost almost as a by-product we

00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:17,000
happen to be an incredibly large family

00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:19,940
of great people you know it's a project

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,970
about the people first and foremost you

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,820
know if individuals are not cared about

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,679
if we don't help each other support each

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:34,009
other the operating system doesn't

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:36,529
happen before which is that I remember

00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:38,809
being interviewed the year that Lennox

00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:41,480
con foster was first held in Hobart and

00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:43,220
at that particular time I found myself

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,289
is the chairman of the Technical

00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,779
Committee also temporarily serving as

00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:51,649
the project secretary because of an

00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:53,419
abandonment of that role and a reporter

00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:55,549
interviewed me and he asked a bunch of

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:58,009
questions about sort of how early coping

00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:59,990
was his huge discussion there was a gr

00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:01,940
at the time about whether we could or

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,149
could not release with binary kernel

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,549
firmware blobs in the distro on and I

00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:09,139
sort of spontaneously commented on the

00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,720
fact that I thought you had to be

00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:13,210
careful to distinguish between the vocal

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,179
minority and the

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,070
non-vocal majority in a community as

00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:20,440
large as Debian and I've thought about

00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:23,490
that a bunch of times since because you

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:27,010
know we get sometimes really voluminous

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:29,080
threads of discussion but if you stop

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,510
and look at it it's often the case that

00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,860
it's a really small percentage of the

00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,419
people in the project that are

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,580
contributing to any one of these

00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:39,279
particular discussions and that makes

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,130
perfect sense because we cover so much

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,500
technical landscape at this point that

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,809
it would be highly unlikely that any of

00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,360
us you know had relevant opinions on all

00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:52,480
of it all the time I circles will

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,860
profess those opinions yeah and and I

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,500
think the point that I'm trying to make

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,600
is sometimes if you sort of wake up and

00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,760
go read you know a thread or two on

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,070
devalue sort of go oh my god everybody's

00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,260
going crazy you have to stop and

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,940
remember that it's like everybody who

00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,740
thought it was important to spend their

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,140
personal time today adding negative

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,690
energy to that particular thread may

00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:16,000
have gone crazy but that says nothing

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,559
about the 90 some percent of the rest of

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,809
the project that we're quietly working

00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:21,340
on fixing something and uploading you

00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:24,309
know a new version of a package while

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,679
that discussion was going on and you

00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:30,490
know that doesn't necessarily provide

00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:33,610
any sort of suggestion about how to make

00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:36,010
the discussions cleaner or easier or

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:38,289
more fun to read but I've certainly

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,630
personally found it invigorating to

00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:43,840
realize that oh okay yeah you know a

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,909
quick check on IRC of a few people whose

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,740
opinions I respect and I realized oh we

00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:49,539
haven't all gone insane all at once

00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,610
there's just the simple luminous thread

00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:53,529
going on and at some point I'll decide

00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:56,169
if I'm willing to choke that whole thing

00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:57,610
down and and see if there's something I

00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:59,380
can add to the discussion but in the

00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,899
meantime I'm gonna go you know upload

00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,879
gzip 1.9 because I just realized how

00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:06,849
long it's been the guts out

00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:07,959
that's uh you know there in other words

00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:11,409
I think it's really important sometimes

00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:13,179
to realize how many people actually are

00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:15,369
set up around the project doing good

00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:17,399
stuff every day even when we're so in

00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:22,359
the middle of some of our nastiest

00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:24,190
discussions there is slightly tyranny of

00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:26,649
the spare time as well involved in that

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,899
in that if you do have the time to

00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:32,109
contribute to one of those long lists

00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:34,659
multiple times then your voice your

00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:36,940
opinions are sort of somehow waited for

00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:39,699
amplified waited a little bit more yeah

00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:44,289
and I did I did like an Rico's remark

00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:45,549
about you know not always pretending

00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:47,259
that you know everything and things like

00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:49,149
that and there are a number of Kim I

00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:52,179
think perhaps slightly newer areas of

00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:54,519
Debian where not knowing everything it's

00:27:52,179 --> 00:28:00,399
just considered absolutely fine for

00:27:54,519 --> 00:28:02,709
example explicitly the debian TI l mirc

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,809
room is just full of people saying i

00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:07,690
didn't know this and it's even in the

00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:09,729
topic saying it says you know this apps

00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,729
you know judgment you know someone

00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:15,159
coming in saying I didn't know jeez if

00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:17,709
existed and it doesn't matter like and

00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,809
it's great it's not only great that

00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:21,009
they've now learned that probably ten

00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:23,349
other people on the channel have now

00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:25,929
learned that Jesus exists and they

00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:28,139
didn't want to say before perhaps but

00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:30,999
also it just moves the needle in that

00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:32,709
Eric area of just like it's fine to not

00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:36,969
know something or to not have this

00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:39,789
perfection this it's just dry for this

00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:43,839
outside image or having that kind of

00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:47,589
thing like that yeah yeah so you wanna

00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,779
add something awesome read oh yeah

00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:51,039
debian tal is a great place to be join

00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:52,749
it seriously

00:28:51,039 --> 00:29:00,009
so today I learned there was a Debian

00:28:52,749 --> 00:29:03,149
tal that's your first contribution tal

00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:03,149
means today I learned

00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:10,690
[Music]

00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:13,450
about about ignoring negativity so

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:16,210
somebody is making a point in a thread

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:21,879
you know with a male that is extremely

00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:25,239
offensive and it takes a lot of strength

00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:28,779
to throw away the extremely offensive

00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:30,909
bit and just get to the point or

00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:33,700
occasionally some people are replying

00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:36,789
into a thread just being offensive

00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:40,119
because they think it's fun and they are

00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:42,629
people that are like that and I'm sorry

00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:45,009
for them they have really bad life but

00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:49,029
we have a bunch and sometimes they

00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:51,999
contribute to threats so there's two

00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:55,330
things in my mind when I follow thread

00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:58,389
one is I'm interested in the technical

00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:00,339
aspect of it and the other is there's

00:29:58,389 --> 00:30:05,049
some behavior that I consider

00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:07,960
unacceptable and it may make sense to

00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:11,049
stick to the technical aspect which

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,749
means ignoring a lot of the red flags

00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:17,019
that are going up in my head or you know

00:30:13,749 --> 00:30:19,149
not taking offense or realizing that the

00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:20,889
other person is childish and letting

00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:25,839
that go and maybe one day they'll grow

00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:28,149
up but it's also costs and ignoring

00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,229
negativity doesn't make negativity go

00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:31,659
away

00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:36,309
this pace is still not a safe and

00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:39,339
pleasant space to work on but that is an

00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:42,159
orthogonal issue so I can bring on the

00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:46,359
technical conversation and drop the

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:50,589
troll the nasty remark drop somebody

00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:53,859
who's trying to be abusive in a way or

00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:58,089
another and stick to the main point and

00:30:53,859 --> 00:31:01,080
then take deal with the negative part in

00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:06,219
some other way if somebody made you

00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:08,979
uncomfortable point it out 20 rcent talk

00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:09,950
talk about it to a friend go on an IRC

00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:13,100
channel fry

00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:16,429
and say is it just me or that thing was

00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,429
not acceptable there's other ways of

00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:22,580
dealing with the negative part of a

00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:24,919
conversation and unfortunately dealing

00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:29,779
with that with them both in the reply

00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:35,419
doesn't help because the threat doesn't

00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:37,669
continue the Fed doesn't continue in in

00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:41,809
a constructive technical way and it

00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:43,970
doesn't solve the social issue because

00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:47,330
that person suddenly got all the energy

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:51,490
they were trying to get all the

00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:54,169
attention they were trying to get so

00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,789
separate two things keep to the

00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:57,830
technical thing if the technical thing

00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:59,690
is still interesting the threat drop the

00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:02,210
threat if the technical thing is not

00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:06,200
interesting or if there is no technical

00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:08,690
thing anymore deal with this discomfort

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,539
that has been caused by people in some

00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:13,130
other way and the harassment is the

00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:18,799
first thing that comes on top of my mind

00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:21,980
several people may leader which is the

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:25,510
full-back for things maybe it would make

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:29,470
sense to set something up that because

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:33,230
negativity is not harassment but

00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:35,510
pointing out that something is made me

00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:38,210
uncomfortable is something that would be

00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:40,580
nice to be able to do and I do it with

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,710
groups of friends because I have friends

00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:45,860
people who don't do we need a fallback

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:48,200
we can talk about that but yeah

00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:51,440
separated two things and both things are

00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,080
worth to be dealt with dealt with but

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,049
this is I mean currently we are talking

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,870
about how to interact constructively in

00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:03,710
a space that is not safe how to make

00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:05,310
that space safe is something desirable

00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,860
but

00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:12,460
and Rico can I ask your advice a bit

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:14,290
more detail along say when you do look

00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,390
at the thread and analyze it a bit more

00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:18,610
objectively and upon doing that and you

00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:21,400
remove all the emotional bits there is

00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:23,950
no technical thing left you said very

00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,660
quickly and perhaps too easily oh you

00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,000
can just ignore the thread in a sense

00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:31,180
but you probably know from experience

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,620
you or brain can't ignore the threads

00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,770
right right

00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:38,950
what do you do I mean let's say I want

00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:43,270
to write on it ya know in that sense not

00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:49,540
write on it and then maybe talk with

00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:55,080
people in private for example so it's

00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:57,880
like there's a nasty nasty car accident

00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,400
down in front of the window of your

00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,280
house and there's already like people

00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:06,540
that are sort of dealing with it but

00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:10,590
there's this morbid thing of looking at

00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:12,700
what how it evolves

00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:16,870
sometimes there's threads that are a bit

00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:26,380
like that that can it get any worse oh

00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:28,360
wow we did congratulations I guess but

00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:32,409
sometimes it's emotionally tough and

00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:35,649
talking with someone definitely not

00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:38,340
being alone is point one on anything and

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:41,080
if we are not able into at the end to

00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:43,210
give infrastructure so that people are

00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,730
not alone it's something that needs

00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,790
improvement I have to say I was rather

00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:52,780
impressed in Saturday's presentation and

00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:54,700
discussion by Minister Tang about some

00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,890
of the tools are being used for

00:34:54,700 --> 00:35:00,300
collaboration and developing consensus

00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:04,720
here in Taiwan and in particular the

00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:06,570
miss time I'm sorry yes the problem with

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,430
knowing people for a really long

00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:12,000
or knowing other people for a really

00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:14,550
long time the interesting situation is

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,290
the the thing that I took out of that

00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,920
that was really interesting is this

00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:21,900
notion of a mechanism for sort of voting

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,750
support or lack of support for an

00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,910
assertion without an ability to reply to

00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,800
the assertion directly if you didn't

00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:31,830
like that assertion go make some other

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,839
assertion and over time we build the

00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:36,089
cluster of assertions that the majority

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,430
of people seem to agree to I thought

00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:40,800
that concept was really intriguing and I

00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,830
wondered immediately is there some way

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,570
that we could apply that you know sort

00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,160
of approach and technology and Debian

00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,680
and I will freely admit that that's

00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,780
totally beyond sort of my abilities I

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,550
don't do that kind of web software and

00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:58,369
so forth but I looked at it and went wow

00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:58,369
that's a cool idea switch to top coating

00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:06,630
[Laughter]

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:09,060
so before the argument starts so one of

00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:12,089
the things about ignoring negativity is

00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:15,089
also there is a responsibility on you to

00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:16,859
not spread negativity so that is the

00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:19,950
you're in a technical thread there is

00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:22,170
something offensive please if you can

00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,359
hold back from responding to it then

00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:26,580
that doesn't then spread that negativity

00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:29,400
and potentially the negativity in your

00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:31,260
response to even more people it then

00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,480
doesn't take up more time of more other

00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,490
for other people by all means go off and

00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,220
find your private space so you know your

00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:41,070
space with a small number of friends and

00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,710
go and when fer but that is not then

00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,560
spreading it back to everybody it's not

00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,570
making the problem worse obviously it's

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,820
hard you know we've all had the point

00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,740
where you've got to respond to oh my god

00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,720
this person's an idiot I've got to tell

00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,730
them they're an idiot but fundamentally

00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,599
that doesn't help anybody in the long

00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:02,910
run you know explaining to people in a

00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,770
less charged way how you you might

00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,740
disagree with our opinion and this might

00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:10,230
be a better way forward is great but

00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,450
diving in and the ballooning threads

00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:15,210
that we get with flames you know we've

00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:16,490
all seen those fundamentally very little

00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,530
actually positive come

00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,690
out so if you can't say something

00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,100
positive I know it's a cliche if you

00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,230
can't see something good don't say

00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,650
anything the word but there is a huge

00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:29,750
value to that especially when the

00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:38,480
continuing conversation is only

00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:41,420
spiraling downwards an example you go to

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,670
someone and say you're an idiot it's

00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,750
quite unlikely that they'll go thank you

00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,440
sir

00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:52,160
I realize the error of my way I'm glad

00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:55,640
you pointed it out to me yeah that just

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,230
puts people in a defensive it is true

00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,850
that when you finally get through my

00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,530
thick brain something that I've been

00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:03,460
getting wrong for a long time my usual

00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:09,410
responses oh yeah I'm an idiot so

00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:11,810
whatever one than one thing that can

00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:15,830
definitely help is to be that person

00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:19,160
that can be complained at be the person

00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:23,990
that someone can seems come to you and

00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:25,550
rant and gripe that and understand where

00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,770
they're coming from when they when they

00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,750
are complaining as in Jane which

00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,400
necessarily literally address their

00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:34,040
complaint so we'll jump on the thread

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,230
for them because that's not really what

00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,560
they need right now but they need a

00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:41,420
sympathetic person exactly yeah and and

00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,150
just to say I see where you're coming

00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,970
from yeah that is yeah and you perhaps

00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,859
don't know the context and and things

00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:51,170
like that so just being there for other

00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:54,290
people can be one definite concrete

00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:55,760
thing you can do I'm certainly also had

00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,590
the experience when some of these things

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,330
were going on and somebody did come to

00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:01,190
me and say hey do you know this person

00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:03,280
what the heck is this all about you know

00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:05,780
should I be really concerned about this

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,430
you know one of the roles that I've been

00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,490
very conscious of playing sometimes is

00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,040
helping to make a connect

00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:12,720
I don't actually know that person but I

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,950
know somebody that probably knows then

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,130
maybe you want to go talk to them

00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:18,900
instead and sometimes it's been

00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,240
interesting how often something really

00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,680
strange happened particularly when

00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,290
somebody all of a sudden was like

00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,790
completely out of character and I found

00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:29,130
out later that it's because something

00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:31,140
really unfortunate or horrific it

00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,540
happened in their life outside of Debian

00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,000
and you know we don't expect everybody

00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,410
to be open and sharing about all the

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,240
things going on in their lives all the

00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:42,150
time that's completely unreasonable in

00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,500
this kind of a project but it kind of

00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,240
goes back to the thing we're talking

00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,450
about earlier if you feel the need to

00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,820
pull away a little bit from time to time

00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:53,040
helping other people who your friends or

00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,960
colleagues in the project know that

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,970
that's happening can sometimes really

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,970
diffuse the sort of frustrating moment

00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:06,720
there is a psychological state called

00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:11,580
arousal that is not what's usually used

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:15,240
for and there's a Wikipedia page which

00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:17,100
is kind of interesting it's maybe the

00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,530
opposite of boredom according to a

00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:26,520
graphing here like you're very very much

00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:31,740
the opposite of bored you're like sort

00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:35,730
of life or death situation like we need

00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:39,750
to act in that case it's like tunnel

00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:42,840
vision lose the context it's kind of

00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:47,250
important to recognize when that is

00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:49,770
going on and realize that tunnel vision

00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:51,530
is happening that you are losing context

00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,020
and

00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:56,570
and wind down for that so in that

00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:58,490
situation it really is okay to write

00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:01,700
down a lot of things but not the same

00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:04,040
because you are missing something even

00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,780
just the tone or what the other person

00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,580
really wanted to say because you got to

00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,070
give by the way the other person was

00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:12,320
saying something so recognize that that

00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:15,890
you're breathing faster your heartbeat

00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:19,010
is faster you you are in a hurry

00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:21,380
your reputation depends on it all this

00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:24,980
is is a specific psychological state

00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:28,670
that is generally unhelpful unless you

00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:31,070
need to run away from Tigers which is

00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:33,650
not something we do generally in in

00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:38,330
modern society but the the wiring is

00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:39,770
still there so write down all you have

00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,900
in mind because you are extremely

00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:45,350
productive at that point but maybe not

00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:48,200
on the point and then wind down go I

00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:51,920
work from home I go for the laundry it's

00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,960
fantastic and and then go back to what

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,060
you've written realize you've been an

00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,790
idiot but there were some points that

00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:01,970
could be salvaged throw it away rewrite

00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:05,240
it it's very rare that you ever need to

00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:07,100
send that email wife you know who how

00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,930
does that have a matter it will wait

00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,580
until tomorrow when your karma when

00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:13,370
you're clearer when you can actually

00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:15,650
make a reasonable point that's a really

00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,840
tough flea movies going on that and

00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:21,200
tomorrow there's like thirty more males

00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:23,420
that rise your arousal in that case I

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:27,650
tend to like postpone until people

00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:29,020
stopped writing that's a good time to

00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,460
find something other than

00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,590
to work on for a few days and my

00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,150
personal experience yeah you know and I

00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,800
think it for all of us it's going to be

00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:38,350
different right we all have sort of

00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,870
different amounts of tolerance for noise

00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:42,700
in our lives things that are going on

00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:44,920
around us that aren't really making us

00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,990
happy or providing that positive

00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,150
feedback that causes us to be encouraged

00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:50,710
to want to keep engaged in the things

00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:54,490
that we're working on or the people that

00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:56,170
were working with but in and I suspect

00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:57,850
it's obvious to all of you and everyone

00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,010
who watches the video of this in the

00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:02,560
future that none of us are you know

00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:05,410
highly qualified experts in some of

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,120
these areas but I do hope that our

00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:08,830
attempt to convey some of our

00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,390
experiences and some of the things that

00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:14,410
we've learned as best practices for

00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:16,180
personally coping with some of these

00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:18,880
things and helping our friends and

00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:21,730
colleagues in the project be able to be

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,890
positive and productive and engaged has

00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:26,680
been helpful or useful to all of you

00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:29,140
with that we're essentially out of time

00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,120
and so I think rather than trying to

00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,890
open up for questions in the last less

00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,170
than a minute I'll just thank you all

00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:36,760
very much for your attendance and for

00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:38,410
your attention this afternoon and we'll

00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,610
look forward to talking to all of you in

00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:42,630
the hallways through the rest of the

00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:42,630
week thanks much

00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,540
