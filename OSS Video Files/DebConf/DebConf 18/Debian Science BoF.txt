okay welcome for the Debian science

00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,599
pause my name is Anne

00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:16,960
I'm a physicist working basically in the

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,630
Debian maids team and because medicine

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,449
biology is closely connected to science

00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:26,589
that we have we are covering common

00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:30,640
things I'm also always engaged in Debian

00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:34,480
science I just have prepared some slides

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,089
which show who is working the demand

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,559
science team you see the deviant science

00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:44,260
team is uploading a lot of packages this

00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:48,190
is the number of packages done by

00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:51,129
different people I realized that I did

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:55,180
lots in the last time but this almost be

00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:58,949
our packages hunter black tea is quite

00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:01,840
active service well it has more less

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:05,140
initializes the team always here in the

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,960
room and these are the active people and

00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:12,100
to see the they are continuously

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:15,009
contributing on the Debian Science user

00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:18,819
list to be our discussion discussing

00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:23,020
common topics about what should be

00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:25,270
packaged and kind of interaction between

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,509
users but mostly developers this could

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:31,569
be quite good if there would be some

00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:33,880
more users asking questions like what

00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:37,709
could be packaged was what's interesting

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:41,259
for the users but maybe this becomes

00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:43,060
some more use in this sense there's also

00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:50,979
a developer mailing this we have

00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:53,009
basically people are yes some technical

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:56,050
things will be discussed and

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,000
specifically these two people are

00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,429
actually not even science members but

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,649
they are doing QA vlogs a we have a pack

00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:04,929
see as of the packs or also potus's are

00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:10,020
not really contributors as a team but

00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:12,489
they are asking the team to do something

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,580
these are the people who are hunting

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:16,720
parks in the Debian science team so you

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,300
have

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,250
was also alder and Smee are mentioned

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:26,870
there because we are fixing bugs in all

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:32,420
packages and these are the people who

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:35,990
are contributing to the to the version

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,580
control systems this is in 2018 is

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,740
little bit short because I did not

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,510
switch this graphic Susana I need to do

00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:47,000
some boxes for for this but you see that

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:51,490
we are constantly committing things to

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,520
for the packaging and yeah

00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:57,770
this is my team definition which I use

00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,330
in the Debian made team it's not so good

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,640
working in the Debian science team

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:05,020
because in the DDT we admit he makes

00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,730
experience that I had a problem at

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,410
Saturday night 12 o'clock and I was

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,970
writing to the mailing list and on the

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,680
Sunday morning when I opened my laptop

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,790
somebody said oh I have solved your

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,490
problem from yesterday

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,510
and so I wished that the Debian science

00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:25,630
team would be more like this that we

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:28,550
cooperate more and people would not just

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,920
stick to their own packages and reach

00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:35,239
out to others and help others a little

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,850
bit more this is unfortunately you can't

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:42,700
see it here on this screen this is this

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:45,890
is a bit sad I need to explain this this

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:51,350
projector has a problem right so I hope

00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:55,580
it stays this bar reflects how many

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:58,400
people are or how many packages are get

00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,110
contribution by only one person this

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,090
number of packets gets corner

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:05,390
contribution by two persons three or

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,250
four it goes quite steeply down this is

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,370
not really a team because if we would

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,410
have a team the number of packages who

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,400
are only by what are maintained by one

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,169
person would be well basically zero and

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,959
then

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:22,509
since Annabelle team the graph goes like

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,999
this so most packages are maintained by

00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:27,969
two or three people and not only by one

00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:31,689
person's with which shows that this team

00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:34,569
has a problem not really a problem but

00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:37,020
it's not really team work but it's a

00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:45,120
collection of single package maintainers

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:49,650
which I would like to improve so I have

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:53,439
prepared a wiki page which is exists

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:56,919
since several years for the TV on

00:04:53,439 --> 00:05:01,449
science puff and I switch to this wiki

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:04,120
page and we can also take notes for in

00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:07,060
copy if somebody wants to take notes

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,060
here this would be a document where

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,919
somebody could do some notes for for

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:17,770
this puff these are all my slides I

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,589
mentioned that we hand around the mic

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,599
and you say your name and why over here

00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:25,029
and what you are expecting from Tavian

00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:27,039
science and how we want to contribute to

00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:29,650
TV and science it is okay for you and

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,149
you maybe you can start because you are

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:36,069
sitting next to the mic say your name

00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:37,960
why what you are doing and then turn

00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,210
around the mic and then we know each

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,969
other and then we talk a little bit

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,909
about different science I hope you work

00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:49,539
fine this is okay I'm Rafael Li from

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:53,889
China and Jen I'm a robotics engineer I

00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:57,990
work on robotics systems mainly worked

00:05:53,889 --> 00:06:04,529
on logistics with our company at designs

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:04,529
Adam the main heat rolek opening

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:14,469
solutions for logistics for the existing

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:19,029
industries they use some computer vision

00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:20,230
to solve the problem but for ordinary

00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:24,590
computer vision

00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:30,860
implementations it cannot tell different

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:33,460
packages we have packages from different

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:37,490
sizes and different colors so the

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:39,800
pattern matching in traditional computer

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:43,910
vision can now work so we develop

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,230
algorithms and software structures to

00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:51,110
solve that problem to make the

00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:54,139
classification automated okay I need to

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,620
tell you said robotics or logistics is

00:06:54,139 --> 00:07:00,590
your oath because we have this robotics

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:06,080
task you should know it are you aware of

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:08,270
this Debian science is divided or has

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,490
created some tasks which contains

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,610
packages like mathematics metrology

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,340
world and we have also weighed amount of

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,000
the screen is not good here we have also

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,000
robotics

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:40,220
it's not well it's it's a difference

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:40,220
between my screen and this screen sorry

00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:48,560
so we have robotics so the deviant

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,720
science team has created different

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,870
so-called tasks this is a blend term and

00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,440
this one is collecting everything was

00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:01,200
connected to robotics this is a robotics

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:06,600
task which has applications and we have

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:09,330
all also robotics devel robotics the

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:14,100
well these are technicians which are

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:18,540
used in developing applications are you

00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,700
aware of these packages is goods and

00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,200
then I can transport some information to

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,169
you this is saying this is the point of

00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:30,180
all yeah and if you have some

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:34,380
applications which are missing here then

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,930
we should packages it I don't know if

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,409
you aware about how to build Debian

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:42,060
packages or not we are using Debian you

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,150
are using Debian right have you built

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,760
your own Debian package yes okay then

00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,770
you can build official Debian packages

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,830
by finding a sponsor and we put it into

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:56,089
official debut on ok well consider that

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,290
yeah and you should so your task is

00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:00,810
subscribe to the mailing list and say

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,810
hey I'm the robotics guy I want to

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:06,120
contribute here and you also see you can

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,070
also see your friends it is Jose Luis we

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,510
be able and Dmytryk know this is

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:18,800
probably responsible but the maintainer

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:23,430
is is Jose Matias also sponsor also here

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:26,070
maybe it's just for sale but he would be

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:30,320
already I think people paloma jalapenos

00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:33,740
it's about Spanish guys right it's

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,740
coming up here

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:40,089
he is also working on robotics these two

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:43,750
guys and if you work together you can

00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:46,720
make you can't cover the robotic starts

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,960
even better and because we have no

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,600
logistics tasks you if you have some

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:57,100
dedicated packages for logistics we can

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,770
add the tasks with this one okay if he

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:04,839
has questions now or later

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:05,440
I'm here three four phobic okay okay

00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:13,960
thanks

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:18,210
parts of my two weeks hi my name is Lori

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:28,920
means Sugimoto I came from Japan my I

00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:33,850
worked programmer I I worked

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:40,400
Postgres GIS programming time up time up

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:43,610
Inc it programming on GIS data and

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,610
[Music]

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:59,000
di Stata Islam science baseless science

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:59,000
and I study science science

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,730
I

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:23,320
I know I know beyond Sciences in the

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:30,709
print project many brains I don't mean

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:33,290
IIIi understand any brains okay if you

00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:38,140
are working with GIS do you know that we

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:41,140
have an debian tree i esteem Steve

00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,140
aye-aye

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:56,450
I know I know possible he is our first

00:11:51,500 --> 00:12:00,050
time yeah so maybe in DB Andrea s has

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,529
also dedicated process of like debian

00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,970
meat

00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:08,200
gbng is they are both scientific plants

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:12,950
which have dedicated packages so maybe

00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,810
you find some some software here and

00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,810
maybe you can work together with the

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:20,529
Debian tree is team this would be

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,529
interesting for you

00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,429
[Music]

00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:43,420
so then you can pass the mic hello

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:51,550
everyone my name is wen ting yang I come

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:54,339
from Taiwan and I I studied law the

00:12:51,550 --> 00:13:00,040
focusing information law so and

00:12:54,339 --> 00:13:03,910
interesting in user privacy those kind

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:08,560
of issue and actually I had not familiar

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:12,610
with Debian but I used to burn too so I

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:19,120
just ran into some topic and go into the

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:23,230
room and and listen and yes I okay

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,260
that's all huh now if you study law

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,579
there is kind of a blend which is more

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:33,029
or less dead it's called deviant legs

00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:37,630
there is a mailing list but it's mostly

00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:40,390
not used basically dead so maybe you can

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,699
write an email here and maybe we can

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:45,220
just discuss something but if it's a

00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:48,399
difference about if you talk about even

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:51,399
about law and law issues or even if you

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,130
talk about privacy privacy or more

00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:58,649
general English is not necessarily law

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,649
so thanks for doing for showing up here

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:11,230
yeah hello my name is sherry I'm from

00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:13,839
mainland China I'm from Shanghai I'm

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,559
working in a company which is doing

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,290
Internet of Things IOT and I just jump

00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:23,739
into company so I don't know what would

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:27,009
company to you sorry and I'm almost

00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:30,670
nothing to do with the with IOT I'm a as

00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:33,879
I Iike a sorry guy so I don't know too

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:37,899
much about the devices

00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:42,040
yeah put it like that yeah I think

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:45,610
there's also some some IOT team but yeah

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:48,850
it's not listed here but I was planning

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:52,029
to go here to pick something about that

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:55,059
but I'm not prepared for for discussing

00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:59,920
about it being pretty like that find

00:14:55,059 --> 00:15:04,239
that you are you thank you okay um fancy

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:08,079
huh I'm also from Shenzhen China and I

00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:11,910
was interested in Debian SAS because my

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:16,360
personal is kind of my personal interest

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:20,439
related to mathematics and physics I was

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:23,999
planning maybe I can get some packets to

00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:32,399
work on my own PC and which utilize some

00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:32,399
mathematics phenomenon or physical

00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:40,749
principles on my PC and I think I can

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:45,160
can a little thing a little bit of

00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:47,649
things from this off so yeah what what

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,949
what I can I hope you can learn he said

00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:53,230
we have these tasks mathematics and

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:56,649
mathematics diverse your mathematics

00:15:53,230 --> 00:16:00,540
relevant applications and yeah I have

00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:00,540
noticed that even all this okay

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:12,030
hello my name is Tommy Leo and I'm from

00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:19,260
Taiwan and I'm working in tricky tree

00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:26,470
and my major job is to study and

00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:31,720
developing a co reason for panoramic

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:35,430
video and me some computer vision such

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:39,250
as disparity find the disparity of

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:41,110
imagery yeah that's all that sounds

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:44,110
interesting I don't know if you have

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:46,930
some support here what may be you is it

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:51,000
I always recommend that you subscribe

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:53,830
this deviant science mailing list and

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,900
discuss what you would like to see in

00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:59,230
Debian and so this is always helpful

00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:01,230
maybe there are some friends just hang

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,760
around on this list and not too shy to

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,100
write something and then you find some

00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,940
friends say others this is some chance I

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:14,829
can't promise maybe you want to pass the

00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:18,790
mic or you come close okay hello my name

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:22,780
is a - I'm from Brazil and we us because

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:26,199
of a t-shirt and I just finished my

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,930
masters so why was working benchmark

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:33,730
applications to perform scalability

00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:36,070
analysis and that's one thing that I'm

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:40,570
terraced in data analysis related to

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:45,280
performance and scalability but I'm also

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:47,670
interesting in covering new tools to to

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,780
get more data related to Debian I

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:52,330
believe that Deb has a lot of

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:56,920
information and we could make science

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:59,800
with it and I'm here to discover some

00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:02,250
tools that are already available in the

00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,960
dev infrastructure I recommend to read

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,760
all these charts here we have data

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,850
acquisition which is wholly irrelevant

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,420
for us for data analysis and so yeah

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,809
house and if you have some ideas how to

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,049
restructure all these

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:20,210
trust maybe we could add some more which

00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:23,809
fits more fear that's the idea of the

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:27,019
task is to say apt-get install science

00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:29,980
this say data acquisition and to have

00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:32,720
everything what it's inside a be on to

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,210
on your computer with only installing

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,399
one package this kind of meta packages I

00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,740
explain tomorrow my in my talk about

00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:43,519
French techniques this should give you

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:46,700
some idea this is not a static thing we

00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:49,009
invented this is some house is in flux

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:55,519
and if if it can be made better please

00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:58,850
provide some information hello I'm

00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,740
Stephen I'm living in a small city in

00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:05,960
Germany and member of a hackerspace

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:09,409
there so to us I think the the

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,350
electronics packages the electronics

00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:18,559
tasks would be most relevant to to what

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:22,869
we do there and yeah we'd we'd do a lot

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:26,200
with Arduino and small embedded systems

00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:26,200
ok thank you

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:35,659
I am the Ashley I'm from Hawaii is a

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:40,399
beautiful city

00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:45,260
I'm 30 in biology so I'm not cross

00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:48,289
computer and I just I don't know they'd

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,940
be end before I don't know they being

00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:53,480
come um you know it's wrong so I'm here

00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:59,899
okay thank you

00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:03,500
that's nice hello everyone I'm more Joe

00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:06,350
I'm Chinese master student and I am a

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,049
member of Damien science team recently

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:12,880
I'm working on some deep learning

00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:18,159
packages and truly our language and mkl

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:20,779
thanks hey everyone

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:25,659
yeah my name is Yoon Chan chai and I

00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:29,409
come from I come from million China and

00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:31,639
actually I'm I majored in chemistry and

00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:34,899
that man is actually my working

00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:37,760
environment on some scientific computing

00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:41,240
the Pakistan currently using is

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:45,679
basically Mopac for some quantum

00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:48,049
chemistry computing and actually some

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,260
sometimes on chrome x4 vernacular

00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:54,230
cementation and that's it and and

00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:58,960
basically a user I am NOT a didi yet

00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,960
oh wait a Maltese

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:09,010
this is DB DB GM team which is probably

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,190
where you can find some friends all

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:14,770
these like a Bianchi's or tibia made we

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:18,000
have also division so if you are

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:20,559
chemists they are really in need of

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,400
people who are working together with

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,860
them math so if you could learn how to

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:31,960
package and join this team this would be

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:34,330
really really good because as well only

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,600
five people about souls which are

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:40,450
working this and sex I could use some

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,520
some help so if you join the team they

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,760
are all friendly and kind people and

00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,940
looking for some more contributors thank

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,940
you

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:54,549
hi everyone my name is Rochelle I'm a

00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,340
student of linguistics and I'm gonna

00:21:54,549 --> 00:22:00,880
start my master in conditional English

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:05,410
takes this year in Europe

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:08,980
I used Debian science linguistics during

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:12,940
my bachelor project actually it's basic

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:16,120
Python and RTK which is great well my

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,549
suggestion is that maybe sighs ow Oh

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,860
Frank oh I should be included in the

00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:25,169
event the linguistics package because

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:28,900
it's essentially used in every single

00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:32,530
linguistic project yeah areas you see we

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,809
have even linguistics tasks and if some

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:38,559
something is included or not included is

00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:40,740
basically depending on who really do the

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,740
work

00:22:49,530 --> 00:23:03,370
careful the video stream if you want to

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:06,130
get something included then it's a best

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,690
idea if you included yourself it's not

00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,960
that hard

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:14,650
we everybody of us started I have it

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,830
someday I also did my first package it

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:20,380
was a little teddy pudding around on the

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:24,070
screen so I did it so to make my son

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:27,040
happy so you can you can learn it that's

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:29,200
and it's it would be a good idea I don't

00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,299
know how many people in the Linguistics

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,980
are working let's let's have a check

00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:40,120
it's not so many people as well just

00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:42,700
sponsored by me here it is I think it's

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:47,710
Kartik mystery I think I have seen his

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:51,100
patchy on the dead conf so wonder why he

00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:54,429
isn't here in this buff those there are

00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:57,130
some people I think I think you should

00:23:54,429 --> 00:24:00,820
you should watch out for

00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:03,490
Karthik mystery I've seen this patch

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:07,690
higher on the DEF CON I'll have no more

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,140
face behind the pots talk to him well

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,419
together

00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:15,000
it's a package you need and put it in

00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:15,000
the ER this is my recommendation

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:40,799
oh you share this one looking for me

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:44,809
again and people okay I actually you you

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:49,279
said that you use an LT k package right

00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:53,549
and I'm the chick a package maintainer

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:57,360
do you use Spacey that's that's that's

00:24:53,549 --> 00:25:06,600
also a famous computation or linguistic

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:08,789
package spacing yeah okay actually

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,490
actually some of my research project

00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:14,159
covered covered the natural language

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:21,230
processing but it's not my major but I

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:24,899
maintain some package recently I know

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,830
one month ago I started to package

00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:28,860
Spacey

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:31,440
but that I aborted it because I don't

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,870
have enough time if you are interested

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,820
in some packages like spacey

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:40,260
you're welcome to country built please

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:48,630
please shut the mic that we get

00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:52,919
everything on the video stream the

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:54,929
contact should basically be dependable -

00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,710
science at this study when to talk

00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:59,370
because if you trust you to discuss each

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,330
other

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:05,880
you waste chance that somebody else

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:08,159
joins the discussion so I would really

00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,309
strongly recommend to discuss on the

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,529
mailing list for instance this Karthik

00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:16,260
mystery might have some additional input

00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:19,320
to your discussion so please use the

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:22,860
mailing list and discuss sale and he's

00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,740
I'm trust him that he is also a good

00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,860
mentor than teaching yourself because

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,470
he's doing a really good job thank you

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,840
that's a good very good thing I like

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,130
this conversation inside the box because

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,549
it's somehow his upon the potential

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:41,730
get new contributions okay my nama my

00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:45,160
name is bullish Kesha I am working for

00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:47,200
Debian Astro which was in the beginning

00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:51,789
also a part of deviant science and then

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:55,390
separated into its own blend and for TV

00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:57,669
and science I contribute what advice we

00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:02,650
need and thus more or less common for

00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:04,720
others as well actually I said comment

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,970
if you find if you have our looking for

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,100
robotics and so its might be an

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,380
interesting thing to say how we are now

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,900
four or five people working for robotics

00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:16,960
let's do a separate plant and do more

00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,669
fine-grained tasks and Justices robotics

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,860
analysis is what happened in us oh and

00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:24,429
maybe in other so this is a good idea to

00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:27,039
say now there is a critical mass of one

00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:29,470
one hand packages on the other hand main

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:32,260
channels and then you can build your own

00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:38,789
group which might attract more people

00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:40,030
than such a general science planned okay

00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:42,280
hello

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:45,490
so my name is khalaf i'm working at a

00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:49,360
university in paris and i'm interested

00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:52,720
in formal methods polka verification

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,080
start solving SMT solving things of that

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,210
nature so these are tools which are part

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,179
of the logic no tricks

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:06,370
a task and I've contributed a few things

00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:13,630
to this to this task

00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:17,980
okay so do we have further questions

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:19,690
about something he should do in the

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,830
events although I think the essence of

00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:25,900
this was we have basically we we cover

00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,710
the fields of the people here in this

00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:35,820
room and we could eat could add more

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:39,130
packages to this and the my advice is

00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:43,380
don't wait until somebody else has been

00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:46,090
package just do it yourself because it's

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,420
some time to learn but you know that it

00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:53,350
will happen if you really want to and if

00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:55,120
you Indian it's a way to can you have no

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,730
upload permission if you have you are

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,850
newcomer but you can ask for spawn zone

00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:05,590
and this is deviant developer buff like

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:08,110
all of for instance all I fear that we

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,660
can could sponsor live to it's also my

00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:14,260
selfs and we checked your packaging and

00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:16,480
upload so if you find the team like

00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:19,350
avian science your chances to find the

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,880
sponsor are higher than if you are just

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:26,590
random Megatron because we I try to

00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,180
assemble people with common interests

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:32,140
say and people whose common interests

00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:34,090
are have better chances to to get

00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:38,500
something done so this is the idea of

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:41,710
deviant science or if you have I'm also

00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,960
running the in the Debian me team kind

00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,300
of a sponsoring Pro a mentoring program

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,540
is called mentoring of the months I

00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:52,030
teach people to package something and

00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:55,690
maybe somebody finds the time also for

00:29:52,030 --> 00:30:00,160
you to teach few how to package because

00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:06,280
in the entrance it even is more more

00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:10,960
easy so I have a general general comment

00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:16,230
so I think that the deviant science team

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:19,210
is somewhat atypical in DB on because

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:21,400
and this might explain parts parts of

00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:24,330
the problems that usually dimensionalize

00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,950
because it's not centered around one

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:29,020
computer technology because there are

00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,120
many teams which are centered around a

00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,430
certain programming language that your

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:37,000
camel team operty more Byzantine most of

00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:39,250
stuff stuff like that or KDE or Chrome

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,220
or things like that and that's of course

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:44,250
not the case with Hasani us says they

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:47,730
made use any any technology

00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:51,240
and so maybe it's not not not really

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:54,720
fair to compare the statistics with what

00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:57,230
you see in the bottom so maybe the team

00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,360
which is clothes clothes closest in

00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:05,580
nature to this team please do not laugh

00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:07,890
as the game steam very very similar

00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,680
programs yeah yeah definitely did I'm

00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:12,690
not more thing because we have we have

00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,360
language teams which are technology

00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:17,610
oriented and we have application

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,040
oriented teams like games or like

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:24,000
science or all the other plans so when

00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:27,060
I'm doing packaging I have touched from

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,690
from the technology if it is software

00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:32,370
was written at least 10 maybe 15

00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:36,020
programming languages which I don't

00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:39,570
speak myself but I try to do the

00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:41,220
installation methods are reading reading

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,780
how to install and if you know how to

00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,270
install a software then you can

00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:48,150
principle as a package you see how no

00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:51,120
accident so but this makes I'm very

00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:52,980
bright and from the technology but I am

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,440
not very deep if there are problems I

00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:58,620
always need to address a travel team per

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:02,370
team patent team also and ask for help

00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:05,130
and this is maybe also for you the case

00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:07,680
if you find the scientific application

00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,540
you need for your topic but you have no

00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,600
idea about the language programming

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,520
language huge don't should be afraid

00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,370
about this because we have all the

00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:20,040
language teams and you can ask them and

00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:22,380
there's also I just repeat what I said

00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:26,280
in the boss before there is a Debian

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:30,720
mentors list DBA mentors help you doing

00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:33,360
the packaging and this despite the fact

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,730
that I am a Debian developer since 20

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,830
years I'm frequently showing up there

00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,930
and say I'm need help for this or that

00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:42,510
problem and this is a very nice

00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:44,970
experience when you get the help after a

00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:50,180
couple of hours which you come to

00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:52,920
yourself and yeah is a lot of knowledge

00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:55,740
hidden somewhere in the Navy on universe

00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,500
and you trust you should just try to

00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,410
find

00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:04,680
to this knowledge usually by asking or

00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:07,720
meeting this and I just tried to

00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,720
propagate the deviant signs this first

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,430
and then we can redirect you to to these

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,430
places where you can find help

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,929
or Christmas

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:38,360
I can maybe sure III have other comments

00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:42,350
a general comment to do the possible

00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:45,710
problem with science related packages is

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:49,690
that there are sometimes badly perceived

00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:52,160
in the community for a certain reason so

00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:54,040
software which is coming from

00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:58,550
universities from research institutions

00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:00,290
have a certain that image which is that

00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:04,550
they are badly maintained that they are

00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:06,680
one short developments that is some some

00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:09,320
PhD student or some researcher for his

00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,390
research project he was a software and

00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:15,200
puts it on it on his webpage and then a

00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:17,150
PhD student finishes his thesis and goes

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,550
away or the research or course on a

00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:23,480
different project and then the software

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:26,180
is no longer maintained and for this

00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,190
reason scientific software often has a

00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:30,340
quite bet that image and in the

00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,720
community which is not completely

00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:38,660
completely wrong so there is some some

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:40,160
foundation for some some or like issues

00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,250
a publication and then forgets the

00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:45,380
software something like this but it's

00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:47,740
well you find examples for this and you

00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,570
find examples for things which are

00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:53,480
definitely better maintains and so we we

00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:55,070
we have I agree on the Debian

00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:59,600
development english scientific software

00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:01,370
some sample images image for from some

00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,950
people specifically the people who are

00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:06,920
doing the boards to other software the

00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:09,230
scientists writes a sofyan MT 64 and

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,600
don't care about are more even more

00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:14,200
strange architectures or changes the

00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,460
wrong word is a bit tastes unusual

00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:20,240
architectures which has a good reason

00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:22,790
because who wants to do gene sequencing

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,090
on his mobile phone nobody will do this

00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:28,970
and so it's no real need that this

00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:31,340
software really runs on mobile phones or

00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:36,080
other Internet of Things

00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:38,180
typical devices the argument the porters

00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,510
have in this case is that if the

00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:43,260
software is

00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:45,930
written it can run on any hardware it's

00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:49,350
true but the scientists just don't care

00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:52,800
and we also have limited manpower than

00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:55,920
we say okay we provided for amd64 and

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,850
this must suffice for for all practical

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,970
cases is sufficient and other cases yeah

00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:08,010
who wants to port it he can perfectly

00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:17,850
fire back reports and fetches any more

00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:22,650
comments we have seven minutes left so I

00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:25,530
would like to know if he Devon has some

00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:29,040
tools for example Chuck says data throw

00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:32,160
other tools for example UDT and get data

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,100
from archive as well in an easy way and

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:40,410
you have its kind of tools to facilitate

00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:42,420
his work so what data from other I'm not

00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:45,000
sure what you mean about tena but we

00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:47,220
have the data about the different

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,160
packages it's other these these pages

00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,920
are generated from unity everything's in

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,490
unity we have also data I go to the

00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,260
Debian mid package because we have

00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:02,520
what's interesting for scientists in DB

00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:04,410
amid close to every package as this

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,160
information or the citation information

00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:11,940
I'm very keen on its of close to every

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,220
package has a situation which is very

00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,500
important for me because it's an

00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:20,730
additional motivation for the scientists

00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:26,220
that is he are my my publication is has

00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:29,280
another Google hits very search website

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:32,370
and so we we provide some service for

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,750
the software also and they are on the

00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:38,940
other hand more happy if they see this

00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:42,410
and packaged for them because then they

00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:46,890
we have also some metadata about

00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:49,860
registries of the software so this is

00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:52,410
meta data we put into the packaging

00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,630
and then it goes to unity and you can

00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:58,560
drain it from unity directly and for

00:37:54,630 --> 00:38:02,550
incidences and not here it's the answer

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,580
to the question yes okay I would you

00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:08,520
expand on that citation approach here

00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,110
which is I think very important for they

00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,330
are not just for the authors but also

00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:16,280
for the users for example in in

00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:21,360
astronomy there's a big effort now

00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:25,040
ongoing that the people should cite

00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,040
actually the software they use and

00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:30,180
that's well if you have a system which

00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,700
is ready then that's quite difficult to

00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:34,620
find out what's there and what could be

00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:38,190
cited so and if you have all the

00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:40,950
information right there then it's much

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:43,650
easier for the people to find out what

00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:45,900
they actually use so what I'm doing if I

00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,480
emphasize start to package a new

00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,940
software I do that avian packaging and

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,920
I'm seeking for the publication

00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,880
belonging to this and adds information

00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,010
this is for me if it exists the package

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,830
is only complete if this information is

00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,480
included in the packaging I hope that

00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:10,580
every member of the beyond science will

00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:14,910
do maybe we could somehow also ask

00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:20,130
upstream to put their preferred citation

00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:23,940
methods on on their webpage or yeah so

00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:27,870
we do that in the moment already but I

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:32,130
think that's worth everywhere yeah baby

00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:36,630
yeah but I have made some experience

00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:39,050
that 50 percent of absolute upstream is

00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:43,200
very responsive and the other 50 percent

00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:49,710
just don't realize so we can only cover

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:53,030
50% with this requirement sizing it's a

00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:56,330
question to teach people in general in

00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:58,800
I've been writing scientific software to

00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:01,080
to be aware of the

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,390
maybe want to decide that somehow yeah

00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:09,800
it should be easy for others to find

00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:09,800
yeah I fully agree so some more comments

00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:15,480
they say oh no further comments we can

00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:18,960
also stop yeah and you know I'm here the

00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,690
full week if you have questions just

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,490
support me maybe I can redirect you to

00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:28,620
the people who know better than me and

00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:33,540
you know thanks for attending all

00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:35,730
theists and other questions by the way I

00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:39,150
have to model it talk about the

00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:41,490
technique behind how these web pages are

00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:45,120
created and how my topic is are created

00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:47,610
and so on so when you you create a kind

00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,310
of experiments to publication our school

00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:52,830
or paper stuff like this you want people

00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:54,600
to reproduce the those experiments using

00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:58,170
your scripts and use your data

00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:01,430
I have no scripts and no data

00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:04,380
this is this is what upstream provides I

00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:07,650
take sofa and if they are providing data

00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:12,540
then yes but my crush is does it make

00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:15,150
sense like to create packages or to put

00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:19,100
together the the set of scripts that I

00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:23,670
have to try to make my experiment yeah

00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:27,900
or reproducible well I have my personal

00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:32,010
policy is I package every software I'm

00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:34,230
using every software so even if I have a

00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:36,060
very private stuff I'm using on my

00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:38,100
computer's package because if I want to

00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,180
install it on on another computer I'm

00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,610
Way faster

00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:44,610
starting from three computers you need

00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:48,600
to install it well so effort to do the

00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:50,730
package and if some colleague of mine

00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,070
approached me how I need software this

00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:55,380
or that I will not manually install it I

00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:57,600
create the package and the packages

00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,750
installed so it makes sense because

00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,430
maybe you want to run your your software

00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,260
in a cluster also and then you

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:07,369
we'll be happy to roll it out and all

00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:11,369
the machines or whatever application and

00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:13,589
finally the the packaging is also some

00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:15,900
kind of documentation how you install

00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:17,730
the package sometimes you forget all

00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,890
what what did I yeah it's the

00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,200
documentation it said if the packaging

00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:25,319
codes with the rules file documents what

00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:29,819
you did to install the package so it has

00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:31,859
several advantages okay so I think we

00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:34,740
have to finish now thank you thank you

00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:37,170
for attending and maybe see you tomorrow

00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,970
maybe you'll see you in there are both I

00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:42,539
don't know how many people are using our

00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:44,990
this statistic program I'm doing this as

00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:44,990
well now

00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:52,989
