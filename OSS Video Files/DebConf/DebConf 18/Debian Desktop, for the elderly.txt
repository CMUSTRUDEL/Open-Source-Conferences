I was born in year 1955.

So, I can explore the world of elderly people as an insider. This short talk is about a series of workshops which I organized in a French computer club which often gathers a small society of elderly people, most of whom are retired for a long time.

Debian may be a good system for the elderly, when someone can tune it finely for each particular user. We shall consider a catalog of situations implying individual users, and their feelings about such a disruptive environment (just imagine: having lived all one's life with W$, and discover freedom).

You know? old timers are not that different from you. Maybe some day you will feel like them?

okay next up we have George who will be

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:15,920
telling us about debian for the elderly

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:20,100
[Applause]

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:27,029
so we shall begin with the Latin

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:32,250
cetacean or tempura all boards so it is

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:36,329
about kicker who was born a very very

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,510
long time ago and he said that when he

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:43,620
thought about young people who are

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,730
insolent who don't do things as they

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,540
should

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,180
so from this conference we have links to

00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:56,880
Wikipedia and other places where this

00:00:51,180 --> 00:01:01,010
idea is developed however in some

00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:07,470
countries elderly people become numerous

00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:11,820
this is the stock of ages building some

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:17,369
what Parliament in China and you see

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:21,179
that there are not so many elderly

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:26,729
people but you see this part this part

00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:29,999
is going up and up and in a few years

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:39,509
the situation in China will be the same

00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:43,409
as in Europe currently so when I began

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:47,459
to design this conference I did not know

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:54,840
I did not know your age so I built it

00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:59,689
for an average attendee but you are not

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:04,200
average attendees so here results

00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:07,499
governed by website who made some

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,580
anchors about the age of developers and

00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:14,610
as it appears the age pyramid of

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,940
developers is much different from the

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,900
age pyramid of

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:27,680
general population of course less people

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:34,850
are young so I suppose that I am twice

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:38,840
as age as many people here however I act

00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:43,960
as a teacher in French public school and

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:50,840
I know many many students which are

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:54,530
younger than you so be one suppose you

00:02:50,840 --> 00:03:01,280
are insolent young stones next

00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:05,440
generation will be worse so I am not yet

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:12,620
retired these are not my usual students

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:16,280
it is computer social club and these

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:20,660
people accepted to make little

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:25,010
experiment with me to attend few

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:35,180
presentation about freedom in software

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:40,640
and what that can imply so no I already

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:44,630
say that I shall talk about with the

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:49,040
first computer I saw when I saw my first

00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:58,400
computer there was no computer I just

00:03:49,040 --> 00:04:01,610
have big cards and punch holes in the

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:10,180
cards and after some time maybe the

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:13,400
printer gave a result that was in 1976

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:16,820
when you saw a computer well first time

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:20,330
maybe you were very young and maybe your

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:24,590
parents were using it and maybe with our

00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:27,160
plane maybe at that time joysticks were

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,160
news

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:41,470
at that times phones were not that type

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:50,250
of phone that time there are our obvious

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:50,250
differences so people born in the 50s

00:04:50,820 --> 00:05:00,100
have some difficulties to extract the

00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:03,820
telephone from their pockets they often

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:07,420
ask for very detailed explanation when I

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:12,000
began giving some courses for elderly

00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:18,480
people they asked for many detailed

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,480
explanation before becoming more fields

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:29,460
at that time people often have had a

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,460
single job in there or in the old life

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:41,110
many people have been shorter in schools

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:47,370
that you do now I knew personally knew

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,370
many diseases maybe you never knew them

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:56,380
and that's obvious people which were

00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:01,000
born in the 50s now are more than 60

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:08,220
years old have you ever imagined you can

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:14,580
reach such an age another striking point

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,580
active elderly people are often women

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,830
maybe because they live longer

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:27,870
now I shall talk about the little

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:30,000
computer club which accepted to make the

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:34,790
shot experiment with me

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,440
so this club is named Laliberte numeric

00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:45,330
and we met once in mouth once a month

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:50,460
from last March I explained exactly what

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:53,130
we should do and it was about teaching

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:58,230
new technique techniques in computer

00:06:53,130 --> 00:07:03,050
science with Debian and explained how we

00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:07,850
can protect our privacy and how far

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:13,650
smartphone laptops are invading our life

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:28,020
you can find some reports at this web

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:28,850
address should be so invitations that's

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,360
wrong

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:41,729
etc maybe some of you already know this

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:46,200
film nothing to hide so the first

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:47,669
meeting was about the film nothing to

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,530
hide

00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:56,300
it's a young German artist which who

00:07:52,530 --> 00:08:00,900
agrees with a group of hackers to allow

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:04,710
special application on his phone and his

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:10,820
northern area spy application it will

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:16,229
just take data like geolocalization and

00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:20,630
metadata about communication and the

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:24,720
attendance there were 40 people were

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:28,110
most captivated by some testimonials and

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,770
those testimonials came from last World

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,159
War two

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:37,229
and they made a comparison between the

00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:41,830
work made by the East German police

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:45,659
secret police after the partition of

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,659
Germany in two parts

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:54,880
these spies had less information than

00:08:50,610 --> 00:09:00,850
Google Facebook Amazon etc can access

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:03,250
now as I announced during the

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,690
presentation of the film nothing to hide

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:10,870
the club was invited to install Firefox

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:15,279
because it provides better tools to

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:19,000
protect privacy and some plugins which

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:22,779
you probably know you block origin light

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:30,010
beam which can evidence the presence of

00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:34,810
spying programs first demonstration was

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:39,160
just to show how many spies are watching

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:46,510
you when you go on the website of la

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:52,630
post dot fr which is the French post nor

00:09:46,510 --> 00:10:02,040
is it ok maybe some of you know you

00:09:52,630 --> 00:10:07,660
block origin which blocked oh it was 57

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:12,910
few seconds before and now 61 don't know

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:17,770
why many outer websites try to put some

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:22,180
new data and interact with me I only

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:23,520
wanted to see my emails but many people

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:30,220
seem to be interest

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:36,010
I allowed JavaScript here is a

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:37,449
comparison the deutsche post the german

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,240
post

00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:46,639
apparently they knew bad experiences

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:54,440
with the secret policy so well secret

00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:56,740
police excuse me so less data given to

00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,740
spies

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:08,199
so what over what about other national

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:14,079
posts I never tried the Chinese post or

00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:18,040
Taiwanese boost so the question arises

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:23,110
is my computer spying me or is my

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:25,589
telephone spying me the discussion comes

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:30,459
on the possible or impossible

00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:34,720
verification that what my software is

00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:37,720
doing so it is important to use free

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:43,740
labor software because growth software

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:48,779
cannot be audited so I propose as I said

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:52,389
USB stick for people who cannot easily

00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:55,720
install Debian on a computer which can

00:11:52,389 --> 00:12:01,889
boot in a computer and provide the

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:07,240
Debian distribution instantly this one

00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:18,550
can be seen on a website USB dot free

00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:25,560
doc dot o-r-g so as my club wanted I use

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:30,699
some of the I have strange phenomenon

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:35,970
okay the image is cleaner but the

00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:41,019
feedback I have is with many glitches

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:49,529
okay so you cannot recognize people the

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:49,529
images have been a little bit touched so

00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:56,610
here works about privacy using Firefox

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:05,889
thousand meetings were about web RTC and

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,270
comparison with Skype many elderly

00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:11,149
people like to have

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:16,399
communication with the sons daughters

00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:18,529
grandsons granddaughters etc so when you

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:23,390
have access to a high enough bandwidth

00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:27,850
you can use Skype we made the

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:34,120
demonstration about web RTC and

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:37,339
unfortunately the demonstration is still

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:41,420
shows that it is still in the beta state

00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:47,149
in this year things are improving

00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:50,959
quickly but attendees had a very

00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:56,630
interesting question about how can we

00:13:50,959 --> 00:14:06,860
trust that web RTC is less invasive than

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:11,020
Skype so yes I already said that yes

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:13,949
people appreciated a lot that web RTC

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,819
was able to

00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:21,209
work whatever the computer whatever

00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:26,879
fellow you are not tied to a particular

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:32,189
type of computer here are explanations

00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:35,779
about how the negotiation is made before

00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:35,779
establishing a communication

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:50,630
so as a conclusion and just before

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:54,530
questions so Debian and the economics

00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:57,770
variant which I presented seems to be

00:14:54,530 --> 00:15:01,310
well accepted by elderly people provided

00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:04,820
they can be over the rock can be helped

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:10,130
to use it of that computer which is

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:14,420
equipped with Windows by default there

00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:19,510
are many protections around Windows to

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,510
protect the system against the user I

00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:27,290
had more question coming from the

00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:30,800
members of the elderly Club then I have

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:36,800
usually from young students and often

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:40,400
the question were wiser if you were the

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:46,940
photos carefully you probably saw that

00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:49,660
all people are using pencils and pencils

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:55,190
and paper how many people are using

00:15:49,660 --> 00:16:02,770
paper and pencil one two three four five

00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:06,560
well I noticed also that elderly people

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:10,970
are not so impressed by free

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:14,270
bleeding-edge computers so when I

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:18,020
present a computer which is five years

00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:21,230
or ten years old oh okay there well you

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:25,360
are able to make it work oh nice how can

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,360
I reuse my old computer

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:34,540
I got many many interesting questions

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:39,730
from attendees when they were that when

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:43,360
they saw the film nothing to hide so the

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:48,430
question of privacy is important and

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:55,180
more important than I hear it from young

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:59,740
people and like everybody here all

00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:04,090
people need to give some sense to our

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:06,880
practice and it is very explicit I saw

00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:08,530
it very explicitly during the

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,120
functioning of the club

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:17,680
and this club will work in the next

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:28,660
month - so have you any question please

00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:30,730
oh please talk oh no so uh I got the

00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,740
opposite problem and my cell phone is

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,470
always big buttons wipe out my browsing

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,870
history clean off on my private data if

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,030
my finger just moves too close it'll

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,670
wipe out all my private data and

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,470
everything so I'm I just hate that then

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,570
I've been real old

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,220
I hate when my cell phone gives me one

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,120
second read some message and it

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,970
disappears

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,070
I always can't read it fast enough and I

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,840
make the characters bigger and it pushes

00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:00,760
them outside the box they don't fit in

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:03,040
the box and I'm big Maps application I

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,490
make the maps bigger but the road name

00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:09,760
gets smaller so I'm always losing and

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,380
when I use the time the dictation when

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,290
you're talking to your cell phone and it

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,750
types for you you know I use these cool

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:19,150
words like cuz like instead of because

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,400
it says CU z thinking like some I'm some

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:26,860
kind of young person to make my letters

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:29,140
to my mom looking bears yes I suppose

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:33,240
you are talking about the user interface

00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:35,160
the user interface doesn't fit

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,640
the general profile for elderly people

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,720
so I think there is a great work to be

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,210
done and that work can be done by

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,690
volunteer people I think I strongly

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:56,010
believe that the Debian community can

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:58,490
give a strong development to it I really

00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:01,410
like the point you're making about the

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:05,070
increased the larger interest among

00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:08,040
elderly people in privacy yeah and I

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,450
think you're tying it to the decades

00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,990
we've lived through and what we've seen

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:15,270
before the world world - these things

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,100
are not that long ago they're they're

00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,560
fairly recent that human beings were

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,210
there who are still here now not too

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,580
many but you know we know we were raised

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:32,190
with these concerns and one place I see

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:35,160
that come up so often is as a woman and

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,470
as an older person when someone asks me

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,890
to do something on the cell phone and I

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:43,200
say I do not like to use the cell phone

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:46,320
for privacy reasons they will send me to

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,640
some if I tell them I don't like

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,340
something that I'll assume it's because

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,350
I don't understand it I don't know how

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,420
to use Google and that's why I won't use

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,560
Google there is this assumption of not

00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,720
understanding it rather than

00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,950
understanding that actually I think I

00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,600
understand some of these things better

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,970
than you do there's a problem here and I

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,340
would like to talk about it and I think

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,080
this comes up in the separating of the

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:11,970
young people from the older people

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:14,040
saying the younger people are saying the

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,420
way you're doing it is really really

00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,710
great and the reason the older people

00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,320
don't like it is because they're

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,390
ignorant rather than because there are

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:26,780
some concerns there that are different

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:32,180
it's some different I agree they agree

00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:36,680
however I teach very young people

00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:40,670
I teach pre graduate students and I see

00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:44,210
that when we explain things so when we

00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:48,170
have time to explain things they accept

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:51,320
that I am what is called in French nor

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:55,790
DiNozzo which translate to a computer

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:58,700
service I suppose and they see that my

00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:05,560
approach can be a faster than theirs

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:08,510
because I use a syntax so I don't know

00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:12,770
whether I reply exactly your question

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:19,430
but I don't reply my students when they

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:23,720
try to to pull me in the new interfaces

00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:26,600
I rather prefer showing them that they

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:30,800
are missing something when they do not

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:35,390
use all methods at some points so you're

00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:39,080
showing them an alternative that is

00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:45,650
possible for students who attend course

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:46,970
which is known as EOS deformation that

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:51,080
is computer science

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:56,780
at a very light level and they have two

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:59,660
hours each week for all our students the

00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:05,840
only interesting thing is to see that

00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:09,920
when they learn very basic things about

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:13,430
shout for example they are able to do

00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:17,330
amazing things which they couldn't do

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:21,110
with graphic user interfaces you know

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:24,500
you can do something with a knife which

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:27,190
is more acute well done what you can do

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,190
with a spoon

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,030
that's all the time we have for

00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,850
questions thank you George for

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:44,000
thoughtful talking

00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:44,000
