our Deb cough 18 diversity forum we are

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,090

comp and even more serious here in

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,099
Taiwan you know what some people try to

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,980
put us in some side room but we're not

00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:27,899
having it so we got all the broadcasts

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,029
every room because diversity is so

00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:33,750
important for us this time we're not

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:37,500
gonna be defeated by any other DEFCON

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:43,530

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,100
so actually yeah our speakers are very

00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:07,260
powerful so they can handle it so they

00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,340
invite these speakers and they have

00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,650
different and they have their

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,730
specialties in their area and first our

00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:56,250
first thinker would be Asuka Asuka is

00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:01,200
from my camp he's a chief editor of

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,990
micro power magazine and he is as as our

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,810
in Taiwan migrant workers is a very

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,599
important issue and there are there are

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,910
ten there are ten hundreds of thousands

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,579
of migrant workers in Taiwan but you

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,549
actually you can really literally see

00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:21,030
them in all kinds of different places so

00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:23,640
I would like to see more different more

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,499
of migrant workers also in the

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,310
conference in community and in everybody

00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:34,939
else and also the second speaker will be

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:37,439
an epic epic from the abyss from the

00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:39,840
transitional transgender activist

00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,859
organization in Taiwan and he's also

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,019
she's also a soft security engineer and

00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:48,049
she was sure her point of view on the

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,989
difficulties and situation of

00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:54,930
transgender in the provinces and the

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,749
third one Johnny and we have Chinese

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,749
with mine is one of my best friends and

00:02:57,749 --> 00:03:02,939
she she has been working with me on Thai

00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:06,719
ladies Taiwan and when we started

00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:11,189
pallidus Taiwan and she's now live in

00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:14,760
girl intake and the for one I think and

00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:17,159
also journey will show a small gender

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,439
gap issue and the fourth one I think

00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,620
many people here already know her issue

00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,560
and Rhonda and Rhonda is working in

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,719
Debian for many years and also she's now

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,459
currently working for to organize a

00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:36,480
diversity team and she will show us on

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,939
her property problems and her progress

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,959
she's working working on and she is

00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:45,120
facing here and so since we had little

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,689
time here so each person each speaker

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,459
will have ten minutes and yeah I hope we

00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:55,630
still have some QA time but I don't know

00:03:50,459 --> 00:04:02,740
and yeah for diversity issue I think the

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:05,290
Oh for diversity issue I think currently

00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,120
I have talked too long that before this

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,250
conference and I found that we we

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,810
currently have a call of contact and we

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:16,660
had three I don't see more than this so

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,450
I was thinking about if we can do some

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:23,650
something more than the color counter we

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:26,470
can if besides a passive color Condor

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,570
how can we do to invite more people into

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,790
this community into this community well

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:35,590
sure what one more projects for more

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,950
ways what things that we can do to

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,900
invite more people so and ask how can

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,680
you sure about your point of view in the

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,680
migrant workers

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,170
[Applause]

00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,190
hello good morning everybody my name is

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,639
Asuka Lee and actually my occupation

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:06,639
very special angle journalist I think

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:14,639
everybody here maybe you are engineer or

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:19,570
hacker but in the editor in chief and

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:23,289
founder of independent media in Taiwan

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:28,470
and instead my Queens Park is the first

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:32,050
independent media which focus on migrant

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:37,060
people community migrant people

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:42,699
including migrant worker and foreign

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:47,320
spouses and today I here I want to share

00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:49,530
everybody about my my point of view

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,990
about migrant people layered

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,360
disadvantage in information because I

00:05:52,990 --> 00:06:00,539
think everybody here we are really good

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:05,020
in information coding using PC Mac or

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:08,949
programming to something but the migrant

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:13,150
people group they are very weak in this

00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:19,210
kind of part so this today I want to

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:23,530
introduce disadvantaged in information

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:28,810
of migrant worker group and let me

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:33,159
introduce migrant people status of

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:37,680
Taiwan the total population of migrant

00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:44,430
worker is seven hungry southern and

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:46,530
every year is increase in 20,000 to

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,180
30,000 so

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,879
[Music]

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,250
total population is increasing and

00:06:51,879 --> 00:07:04,659
increasing and I think one day the

00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:08,949
population will be over then 1 1 million

00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:12,220
people in the migrant worker they are

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:15,759
from forests of East Asia country when

00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:20,080
an Indonesian Philippines and Thailand

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:23,080
and accept Filipino people the other

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,169
migrant worker from when an Indonesia

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,930
and Thailand they cannot speak English

00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:31,300
well they can only say layer mother

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,120
languages so it's really difficult for

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:38,400
land to communicate with local people

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:46,449
and migrant worker their occupation

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:53,289
mainly factory worker fishermen domestic

00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:56,440
caretaker and made and the last two kind

00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:59,530
of occupation domestic worker and at

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,919
amazing made its period very difficult

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:06,310
for land you have birthday although most

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:11,349
of them only have one day of per month

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:16,479
or even one day of every two months they

00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:21,580
are really few free day written themself

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:26,289
and most people over then they don't

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:28,719
have personal computer also they only

00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:32,250
have a cell phone so they are really

00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:37,329
rely on their own cell phone smartphone

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:40,440
and the power disadvantaging information

00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:43,510
because migraine people make a worker

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:49,720
they are really rely on their smartphone

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:56,480
they can only use three kind of app like

00:08:49,720 --> 00:09:00,740
Facebook like or KakaoTalk or be talk

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:05,570
and other April they don't know so even

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:09,550
they can't use like Microsoft Word or

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:13,040
Excel or email because sometimes a

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:16,519
communicable and maybe I were a then can

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,190
you email something to me it's me sir

00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:22,490
what is email I don't know they don't

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,560
know what is email so if they want to

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,529
send me some picture always use a

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:33,860
Facebook made a Facebook message over

00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:38,149
life and because I before I said they

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,430
have really if you day off so it's

00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:44,690
really hard for Lynch you go outside to

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:48,529
shopping most of time they need to stay

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:52,730
in their employers house so they only

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:56,029
can do shopping on Facebook so they

00:09:52,730 --> 00:10:00,410
really like to buy materials pilot

00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:05,569
products in Facebook group or Facebook

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:11,649
page but sometimes they will buy a fake

00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:16,339
product or they will meet internet fraud

00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:22,089
but nobody telling is dangerous because

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:22,089
they are separate from the society and

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,840
[Music]

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:35,980
ecommerce okay so because the population

00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:40,760
is of a bank when people is more than

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:46,149
seven hungry soda so so some company in

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,149
Taiwan they want to develop electronic

00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:58,399
ecommerce so like so some local company

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:02,390
they want to deliver ecommerce to

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:08,399
migrant people but really difficult to

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:13,470
push because based on the language

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,899
barrier and discrimination the migrant

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:20,579
worker they are really hard you have an

00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:23,970
pink account in Taiwan because I say

00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:27,360
South most Overland cannot speak English

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,610
and Chinese so they are really hard that

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:35,970
you have a bank account even a color

00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:40,010
pink pink servant it's really hard that

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:45,470
you communicate with my green people so

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:51,180
they really difficult you have a TN or

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:54,990
ATM card or a credit card so most of the

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:58,890
time they need to buy things by cash so

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,079
we know the people of migrant worker

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:05,310
like I come to Taiwan is one to earn

00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:11,820
money to send back to the family in

00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:15,390
their hometown but they have no ATM card

00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:19,050
or credit card so if they want to remit

00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:25,550
normally they need to bring a bunch of

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:25,550
cash and cultural remittance center and

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:42,329
and to to send back to their home so so

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:52,380
I said some local company they want to

00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:56,399
develop economic ecommerce but until now

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:59,280
no local company successfully to push

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:03,100
ecommerce to migrant worker group

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:08,190
and maybe some of you were saying we can

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:11,440
teach Lin about we can educate them in

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:15,160
information but it's also difficult

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,430
because migrant workers they have a

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,760
language barrier and very few day off

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:24,600
and sometimes the limitation from the

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,690
info lawyer is really important

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:36,520
important in follow EUR limit limit

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:43,540
their limits layer free day in Taiwan

00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:48,760
and because even the people have free

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:51,610
turns in Taiwan they are they like to

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:56,110
learn Chinese first because if they

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:59,200
learn Chinese one day when they go back

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:03,190
to their home they can find a better job

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:07,290
so they are willing to learn language

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:16,830
first so not very interesting in

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:16,830
information education and even their job

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:27,790
the Java is not stable because caretaker

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,820
they take care of all all the people but

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:36,460
maybe all the people will die or pass

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:41,230
away so if other people has a way the

00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:46,210
caretaker need to go home so it's not

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:50,500
stable of a layer job and finally if

00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:54,160
they receive education but like I said

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:58,030
before they have no personal computer to

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:02,470
use to practice because also we only

00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:07,040
have mobile phone cellphone so it's

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:13,130
really difficult to teach migrant worker

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:18,160
in information ok so this is my share

00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:18,160
sorry for my poor English ok thank you

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,840
thanks for a sacar to ensure the status

00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,900
of the current my microwave workers in

00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,180
Taiwan and I would like to say I will I

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,190
really like to see that we can invite

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,130
more invite them into this community and

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:40,300
yeah since actually their power we are

00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,300
large part actually

the hello and maybe what you please

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,720
Cabrillo showed us about the

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,149
difficulties that have been right

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,970
happening on the transgender sea

00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:22,959
transgender community since actually

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:25,569
this actually if somebody has still

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,430
remember this this panel was in the

00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:29,790
beginning was a transgender Journal and

00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,470
then become a general journal become the

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:36,449
diversity journal and I'm very glad that

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,449
we can cover more issues

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:55,620
I'm a car that we can cover more issue

00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:59,820
here and yeah

00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:02,760
I will also like to I will also like to

00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:17,280
bring this issue of transgender women

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:20,490
and their problem into discussion okay

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,390
hi my name is Abby and I'm a security

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:27,839
engineer and I previous working in

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:33,510
Russian industry and I also for now I

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:36,420
almost walk in walk for souls

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:40,650
some South like independent security

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:44,550
account contracted so so people hire me

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:46,920
to like to invest into their companies

00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:51,570
or the assistant to find out if they

00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:56,310
have any leaks so any yeah you know the

00:17:51,570 --> 00:18:00,929
hackers would do and yeah and I can say

00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:06,300
I am a white hair okay so for personally

00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:09,600
I am a transgender woman which is a very

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:12,120
small portion of this today we have only

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,750
about handful people who are transgender

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:20,760
woman today in this conference and when

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:26,190
we talk about gender we always talk

00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:29,190
about what the sex in the pants or in

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:33,210
the under the chest or in the inside

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:37,980
body or under behavior which kind or in

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:42,030
our head okay we don't know but we do

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:47,490
know is how we human like to categorize

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:52,410
things like short or people handsome

00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:56,000
ugly and rich guy okay because we stop

00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:59,070
different people we know them and our

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:05,480
brain need to understand and so we

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:09,750
catalyze it into different we can say

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:14,279
manifestos we said packet best kids in

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:18,450
your brains we call it catalyzed so we

00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:22,950
can simple as the thing o inheritance we

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:27,330
can say laboring never repeat but in the

00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:30,509
end we figure out we actually in human

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:33,779
beings we don't have any label because

00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:37,110
each one is unique you are

00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:40,710
professionally in coding you are

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:44,250
professionally in security and you are

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:49,169
specially in DevOps and so on so on so

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:55,470
if everyone is unique we are all human

00:19:49,169 --> 00:20:00,539
although maybe in the IC in with our

00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:02,570
audience cover all like all last 50

00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,570
years

00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,590
okay no problem

00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:20,340
what's our intimate to Rizzoli we all

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:24,870
say men and women have different kind of

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:30,360
ring but it turns out in the latest

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:33,260
research every brain is different you

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,900
you might like taste sweet sweet taste

00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:40,440
sour taste or any taste you you may look

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:45,170
lovely you know you will love look

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:50,250
stronger or you click whatever you like

00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:54,360
these are all decided by genes and no

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:59,550
two people are with the same gene for

00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:01,470
agenda we are all under history we are

00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:05,340
on the tipping point of the history

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:12,750
because this tipping point is just like

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:15,960
the beginning of the I can say maybe

00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:19,850
some people will know the black woman

00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,850
movement in the US

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:30,900
because of the history we did we did we

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:33,390
don't know this we don't need all or we

00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:37,020
learn from the education we only know

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:40,520
men and a woman and for the other people

00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:43,380
like maybe for ourselves

00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,679
maybe you this let's play a small game

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:49,640
however you don't think think I am mean

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:52,620
just for a second no problem that's fine

00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,520
and how many people think a woman raised

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:58,440
her head pretty thank you so much and

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,720
how many people think I ain't not now

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:06,440
available that's great

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:11,520
and in our brain in the traditional

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:17,429
concept idea men is in the Box woman in

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:23,159
Nara box and others in another box the

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:27,149
other box is we call nun now by now by

00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:29,970
narrow binary sorry non-binary and we

00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:33,330
also call it the freeze okay

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:35,700
why we call it freeze because we don't

00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,740
know who you are what you are come here

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,409
why you are just like you have talked

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,909
you talk like a man and you just have

00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:49,320
warm water hello were to go wrong with

00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:52,409
you let's talk about history there's a

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,409
story maybe you can remember once

00:22:52,409 --> 00:23:01,289
Ballantine is a scientist say the earth

00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:04,470
is an orbit and he was executed before

00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:10,679
his establish which called

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:18,990
tell inventor University went on he he

00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:23,039
claimed some is Sun is the center of our

00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:27,390
currency and he also claimed a human is

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,670
not the only human beings in the

00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:35,630
universe

00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:41,190
this claim is dangerous violating the

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:47,120
church the bridges in the city's century

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:51,840
so he turned out to be the sentence to

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:55,100
fire today okay now we know the earth is

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:59,270
an orbit and this is common sense

00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:02,190
but we always fall into our common sense

00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:05,010
in our area you know fall so in our

00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:11,550
daily life in our experience and through

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:15,720
these offerings and we see with with

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:18,930
this often we maybe we sometimes we can

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,880
see some dangerously dangerous things we

00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:26,400
need to emit wait a minute

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:30,410
this is time we I will I will show you

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,660
this I don't know if you ever see this

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:42,060
movie it's called it has been a podcast

00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:44,040
and this is the collaboration with human

00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:48,390
beings and the experience they work to

00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:54,330
try to avoid a compact between the human

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:57,600
and Cuba and and because it's been used

00:24:54,330 --> 00:25:01,770
as super power to overpower the humans

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:07,620
weapon so the human becomes afraid of

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:10,500
them and to stop it and turn their

00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:15,420
weapons to the x-men and that's what

00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:19,890
where the story begins in the children

00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:23,790
in the children s rules for for even for

00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:29,890
myself we open scene as freaks

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:33,820
Oh although we are just humans we

00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:36,280
get get out in the morning and brush

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:40,420
your teeth and go to work and get out

00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:42,730
base and I and yeah we all want to work

00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:45,429
together with all the left leave

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:48,820
together we're also coding together and

00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:57,670
open to the program together learn how

00:25:48,820 --> 00:26:00,720
to code care but sometimes we may be you

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:05,320
can say frightened be frightened for

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:08,919
from some people so it becomes some

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:14,470
changing people may not quite trust

00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:19,049
humans so they become you may say a

00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:23,440
little bit and enemies but for me myself

00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:26,919
my empathy is still there and today I

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:31,140
standing here to just let you see the

00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:34,450
transgender people is not the like

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:37,570
spider-man or something with special

00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:44,799
powers or whatever it is we're just

00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:49,900
ordinary people and that's what we talk

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:54,850
we will talk about humans human is for

00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:58,090
of curiosity when we look at the night

00:26:54,850 --> 00:27:01,600
sky we saw the moon in the sky we don't

00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:05,559
know what they come from our instances

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,710
are instance once they told us well

00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:11,590
you'll see the shooting star is simple

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:17,610
as the bad things will happen but we all

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:21,700
know this is just star-crossed to MSV

00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:25,510
Carl Sagan was say we are all born in

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:30,299
curiosity why we just keep this

00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:35,559
curiosity to all things not only for

00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:38,350
computers Debian and community and we

00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:41,549
reach out to all the things we can and

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:45,919
will reach out on people's we we are

00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:50,210
can we maybe we all Cory maybe your

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:55,320
neighbor who are a-changin the person

00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:58,409
reach our dream to her as questions

00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:03,059
don't be afraid because when you afraid

00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:10,769
you cannot take a step you can oh you

00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:14,899
were always understand Vizzini I know we

00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:21,389
will be afraid that's what we humans do

00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:25,580
so we just because we are community we

00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:29,100
will go and go go go

00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:37,590
culturally I know the goatee I know this

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:39,480
is what a community will do and you can

00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:44,220
google a lot of things about religion

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:46,950
online but you may be maybe I am the

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:50,580
first transgender person you ever seen

00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:54,509
in from your eye but I'm glad I'm the

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:58,200
first one but I encourage you to see

00:28:54,509 --> 00:29:03,710
more people more transgender people and

00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:07,049
more even even other genders genders

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:10,090
communities around you and that's all

00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:18,410
for my speech thank you

00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:18,410
[Applause]

00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,990
thank you for

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:56,120
thank you for thank you for sharing

00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,210
about the transit issue actually I've

00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:02,919
been working on bringing the transgender

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:05,720
women's problem the issue into the

00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,539
general women's issue try to try to

00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,789
bring me in two very different

00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:14,270
situations for example our local women's

00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:18,380
groups and our also in where I'm working

00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:22,460
I am working with the Wikimedia women

00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:26,179
and I think it's quite actually this is

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:29,720
quite not so new not shown you actually

00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:32,929
but many people still have difficulties

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,580
since even if many many of them may know

00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:37,220
about trying something about transgender

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:41,330
women but we are actually facing for

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:44,980
example when we are when we are and when

00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:48,169
you appeal we we are afraid of police

00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,490
even if just something that simple I

00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:52,309
told code to toilet

00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:57,320
we are facing we are covered in the fear

00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:59,179
of police arrest or in or for the past

00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:04,460
two years I've been fighting for right

00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:09,470
way to swim you know enemy people men

00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:12,020
may know that in many many gym GIM

00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:16,539
doesn't welcome transgender women so

00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:19,789
yeah so I hope that we can have more

00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:25,100
honestly and then next will be thanked

00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:29,330
and yes and Johnny will show us out her

00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:31,460
experience on women the major issue that

00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:33,559
I was the major issue in diversity that

00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:39,909
gender cap and Johnny will be showing on

00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:43,760
this okay hi good morning everyone yeah

00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:46,789
so I'm very happy to be here and today I

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:50,529
will represent the two women who call

00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:53,990
Taipei beat to share with you guys about

00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:55,909
like but we've done in education in

00:31:53,990 --> 00:32:00,440
coding education in a school and out of

00:31:55,909 --> 00:32:06,669
school and yeah I think it's a very good

00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:06,669
topic today weekend oh sorry

00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,880
[Applause]

00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:24,010
okay it's better thank you thank you

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,799
yeah so actually I didn't know I need to

00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:29,950
use the English so my slicing in Chinese

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,789
but I will share you guys in English and

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,390
try my best

00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:37,690
okay so so happy everyone heard about

00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,440
woman Foucault your CTO country came

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:43,550
raise your hand

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,910
okay nice and did you join any like

00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:51,410
event in women who code type in America

00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:53,390
your country before okay good so yeah so

00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:57,200
we are women who code type a and I'm

00:32:53,390 --> 00:33:00,110
Jenny and Jenny is our city director and

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:05,510
women who code type a actually is come

00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:09,740
from 2016 and we establish in Taipei and

00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:13,130
now we try to encourage more female to

00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:17,360
set step into the coding area and now we

00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:21,100
have over a 800 people 800 female or

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,200
male joining our invade before and

00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:26,570
actually we use different ways to

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,650
encourage a female to start coding and

00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:34,550
one of our we like we like the offline

00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:39,110
like meeting so not just online and we

00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:41,270
host a different like topic of event so

00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:45,170
first one it's like we use the like

00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:49,550
workshop or study group and we this

00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:54,890
point is we host in one of the American

00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:58,190
like code BNY Mellon Bank and we

00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:03,800
cooperate with them to use their office

00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:08,390
and that we can study a book to help

00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:12,380
like different like chance chance change

00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:14,840
their career path to technology field so

00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:19,730
we can tell them how to prepare the

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:24,050
interview and also we have some engineer

00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:26,660
in that area and can share with us how

00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:29,690
to prepare your interview and the second

00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:32,710
one is we are very happy that this year

00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:36,050
we are the Kota old partner

00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:41,419
international partner in Taiwan so that

00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:45,020
we can do it more to the younger age

00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:49,500
people to start coding yeah

00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:54,169
so we we have already did lots of like

00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:57,750
out of cold and I think lots of people

00:34:54,169 --> 00:35:01,620
probably have ever tried or your kids

00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:04,830
have never tried to writing code in on

00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:07,680
website called code.org so they purified

00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:11,160
a bunch of different materials to teach

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:15,600
kids how to code and use the black we

00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:18,390
use the black Lee based programming

00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:24,030
languages to help kids to understand the

00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:27,330
logic of coding and yeah so we go into

00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:30,000
the schools and our volunteers they also

00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:33,570
spend their time including me we go into

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,140
like a shinpei Elementary School and

00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:40,010
teach the teacher how to teach coding in

00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:45,530
the class and we also collaborate with

00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:48,420
some not only low tech company we also

00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:51,360
collaborate with them to tell them

00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:54,750
probably their employees they really

00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:57,210
want to start coding or know more about

00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:59,490
what the engineer is doing so we

00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:02,910
cooperate with them to teach them out of

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:07,140
code so not for the children we also

00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:10,080
teach a thought and we also go into like

00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:15,120
tell Taiwan so you can see that the

00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:18,480
picture' we show is about a female so

00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,360
it's really interesting like the parents

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,560
they usually wants to know more about

00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:29,690
our coding nowaday and because next year

00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:34,050
in taiwan we also will start our first

00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:36,090
year i think their first year to include

00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:39,420
the computer science as a main subject

00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:43,620
in junior high school and senior high

00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:46,140
school so that's the reason why more and

00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:51,840
more people they care about this topic

00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:55,220
issue in today yeah and the second thing

00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:58,830
i want to share is because i was

00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:01,170
engineered before but two years ago I

00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:04,770
decided to change

00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:08,040
my career path to education so I just

00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:11,520
combine the technology background in the

00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:16,109
education passion and now going to the

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,869
schools so we just discover if you want

00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:22,890
to encourage more people start coding

00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:26,880
the best way is you teach the kids yeah

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:30,210
if the kids can can touch the technology

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:35,010
or coding earlier which means when they

00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:38,130
decided to like choose their major or

00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:43,410
choose their job they can have more than

00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:47,190
imagination so yeah so two years ago

00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:51,680
when I've tried when I first decided to

00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:54,720
go to the education area I searched for

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:58,710
like entire search different like

00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:02,670
precision Taiwan and finally I decided

00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:05,549
to just apply for a job in a school so I

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:08,520
went to Eli yeah Eli is the notion of

00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:13,520
Taiwan we were I went to Eli and Joshi

00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:16,920
and become their computer teacher and

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,730
this year I just graduated with students

00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:24,000
yeah so I went there just like a normal

00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:26,640
class every every week I spent a whole

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,329
day and teach over hungry

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:34,920
yeah hungry students they are eighth

00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:39,170
grades and and now he's a ninth grade so

00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:43,069
I teach two years there and just

00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:46,609
just the practice or game my experience

00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:49,250
in school and I also realized that the

00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:52,010
kids in the school they actually they

00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:56,000
don't need to you don't need to teach

00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:58,430
them become you don't need to expect

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,130
them to become a very professional a

00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:04,839
coder or programmer you just need to

00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:09,740
give them the different like technology

00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:13,730
to help them to gain some imagination

00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:16,760
and so we did different like topic like

00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:21,349
we teach them a basic of HTML and CSS

00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:25,190
and we also teach them like how to if

00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:27,859
you want to resolve a big pattern what's

00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:31,059
the first state so probably you need to

00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:32,240
learn how to how to you know create a

00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:37,940
mindmap

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:42,319
yeah and we also try to cooperate we

00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:45,109
also bring some outsource to like some

00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:50,230
resource to like Google copper leap we

00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:57,109
we Kate we got over 200 cardboard and we

00:39:50,230 --> 00:40:01,119
just make the students to try to to make

00:39:57,109 --> 00:40:04,460
them and the interesting is you can

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,549
trial a different way to teach the kids

00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:10,400
so like a Google Cup or I didn't tell

00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:14,660
them how to do that step by step instead

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,930
we ask them to search on the internet to

00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:21,770
to probably search on the YouTube to see

00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:25,010
to watch the video and then try to try

00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:28,250
to make their own one and we used also

00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:30,500
teach them the Python so you can see

00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:33,319
because we don't have much time in

00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:37,130
Taiwan we only have like in junior high

00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:41,119
every week the students only had 45

00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:44,119
minutes in computer science computer

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:47,260
class so we we didn't have much time so

00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,880
that's why we just you know teach them

00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:53,990
based on the projects

00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,520
yeah so the consequence is there is one

00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:58,670
students

00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,860
he made the API using like App Inventor

00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:05,570
and then try to make able to teach the

00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:12,650
great mountain coyote on how to use the

00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:15,710
mobile phone yeah so so so the most

00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:20,150
important thing is I also discovered

00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:23,180
that in this age the female lagrosse you

00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:26,810
just heard well then the male yeah

00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:30,200
probably is because yeah girls are more

00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:33,620
concentrated on the class and we also

00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,260
have the club class so we use like teach

00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:40,850
them are to know how classes lead by

00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:44,420
another volunteer and make the the cars

00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:47,270
the wheel cars and every kids in the

00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:50,210
class I learned very happy yeah we also

00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:53,920
have different like projects in school

00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:57,800
and so what I really want to share is

00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:02,150
first thing is we probably based on

00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:05,930
Taipei by spaced in Taipei but we works

00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:10,520
very hard to make more people to start

00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:14,810
knowing what we are doing and trying to

00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:17,660
reduce the area's so people probably

00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:21,290
will feel while coding is very difficult

00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:24,020
but actually when we try to use the very

00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:26,450
simple way like out of coal we can tell

00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,820
them hey it's not it's not it's not

00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:32,240
difficult it's very easy okay you can

00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:36,110
start it yeah so least this year I think

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:40,250
we try to work out of Taipei and like

00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:42,800
shinshu Iran and we want to you know

00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:45,740
encourage more people out of Taipei not

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,570
only you know in Taipei and we also have

00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:50,600
a pair programming the pair programming

00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:53,990
is like one on one and you can just code

00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:57,190
five different you can you can have a

00:42:53,990 --> 00:43:02,049
one mentor to help you

00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:04,480
yeah so this one is already are playing

00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:07,720
in this year we want to have a local

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,119
coding Club but now we are really needed

00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:14,770
like a sponsorship and some volunteers

00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:19,329
can help us too to start a local coding

00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:22,809
Club yeah so if anyone here you have any

00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:25,539
resource or you have time can support us

00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:28,930
so feel free to contact me

00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:31,960
yeah so we also have a to cooperate with

00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:35,289
like bookstore in Taiwan to bring like

00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:38,530
because I think reading ability is very

00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:40,000
important on coding so that's why I just

00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:43,660
use this one

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,869
yeah just host this event yeah so yeah

00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:51,369
so because I don't have many times so

00:43:46,869 --> 00:44:03,250
probably later we can interact more okay

00:43:51,369 --> 00:44:05,829
so thank you everyone wait okay thank

00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:08,950
you Tony for showing us and actually yes

00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:11,260
it's very important for to reduce a

00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:15,579
cha'aka is very important from education

00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:18,490
and yes and sorry and I hope that we can

00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:23,490
still have five more minutes so yeah

00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,490
Johnny and start joining the wrong

00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:51,860
okay um thanks for being here for having

00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:55,700
me on the panel my name is Rhonda my

00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:59,860
pramantha she and I'm if the deviant

00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:07,810
project since 2000 or even longer but

00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:11,270
official TVN developer since 2000 by

00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:17,150
2004 in the part I realized that I'm

00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:19,790
trans and that was also about the time

00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:24,950
and deviant women project was founded

00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:28,190
and the reason for that even pre women

00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:30,860
project was to encourage more women to

00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:33,470
participate within TVN to increase the

00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:38,960
visibility of the women we already have

00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:44,270
in TBN and to provide mentoring and also

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:48,050
role models there were two conferences

00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:51,740
held one imposter Luna and one in

00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:56,410
Bucharest where all the speaker there

00:45:51,740 --> 00:46:03,380
we're done by people who identify female

00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:09,650
and yeah the young women project is

00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:14,890
still around then there's the second

00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:20,510
point within the that conf we have this

00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:24,830
diversity bursary which is was going

00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:32,840
around as a tear during the confided beg

00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:36,650
or maybe even a bit before for 2016 it

00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:39,920
was sort of separate efforts where

00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:43,130
people could roll up for diversity

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,080
reasons and to increase the diversity of

00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:47,350
the people participating in the depp

00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,350
conf

00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:55,800
since last year it is an integrated

00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:58,900
parts in the bursary process so when you

00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:03,000
register for a conference you have this

00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:08,940
special field where you can fill in

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,940
diversity to the area which sort of

00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:18,369
allows you to get funding of travel

00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:21,660
sponsorship food sponsorship for the

00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:25,770
different diversity criteria which

00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:29,260
includes amongst others gender identity

00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:38,290
people from underrepresented countries

00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:42,760
racial minorities or even age and two

00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:45,520
years ago in Cape Town I was personally

00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:49,210
addressed by some people at the

00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:52,510
conference that it might be time to find

00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:58,359
a specific diversity chapter within

00:47:52,510 --> 00:48:01,839
Davian we had one IRC session so far but

00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:03,730
we have a dedicated IRC channel where we

00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,099
hang out and chat with each other and

00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:10,780
exchange different things that we

00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:14,260
stumble upon we had two sessions last

00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:17,410
year at the tap conf where we talked

00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:20,430
about in what direction we might might

00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:29,020
want to go with the team and how we

00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:32,080
might want to represent it and there

00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:36,280
were some difficulties in my personal

00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:38,920
life which sort of didn't allow me to

00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:42,940
pursue it during the last year very much

00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:46,180
but I really wanted to have this

00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:49,570
diversity team founded we will have

00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:53,380
another session this this week

00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:55,990
look I'm not exactly sure I think it's

00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:58,660
on Tuesday but look it up in the

00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:01,589
schedule you will find it the idea

00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:06,760
behind the diversity team is to increase

00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:10,060
visibility and within the teaming

00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:13,450
community because we actually are quite

00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:17,380
diverse already but it might not look

00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:23,380
like that on the outside we have people

00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:25,930
from different ethnic minorities racial

00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:31,660
minorities different age groups

00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:37,570
different gender identities or sexual

00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:39,940
minorities whatever and it might not

00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:42,250
look like that on the outside so we

00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:46,930
really should work on on creating

00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:49,980
visibility to make it not just being

00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:54,520
part of the code of conduct but also

00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:57,550
having it really visible and and spread

00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:02,400
the words to the outside that we are

00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:02,400
very welcoming Thanks

00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:17,630
things and I wish we can have some type

00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:20,870
I suppose our time is up so this is okay

00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:25,310
I think that the mr. time is waiting

00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:31,690
there okay and a one one or two

00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:36,920
questions any one or two questions and

00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:42,710
also if no if then I have a question for

00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:46,100
each one of you so I think I think and

00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:48,380
I'm very aware of what Rhonda has done

00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:53,630
in the past in the Debian community but

00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:56,540
I still can see the gap between the

00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:59,780
gender gap and also a community scrap so

00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:03,590
I Astro question in in one minutes or

00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:09,650
even 30 seconds be sure okay so what do

00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:13,490
you think we should do besides - besides

00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:16,970
the color contact to see more different

00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:20,150
faces for example to see more women here

00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:23,600
to see more women to see more to see

00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:25,730
more transgender to see more pretend all

00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,680
the different language people Indian

00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:32,510
language come what will what do you

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:36,310
think as we do in addition to call

00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:36,310
contact and one first

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:52,660
I I recently read up about this paper

00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:57,550
from a German language linguist and he

00:51:52,660 --> 00:52:02,950
spoke about why we need a politically

00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:06,310
correct language to reduce to to equal

00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:09,550
out the levels of people participating

00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:13,270
in communication because they're much

00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:21,300
more downgrading words for minorities

00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:23,890
then for a majority so to say and to

00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,270
have an equal level of communication

00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:28,600
between people

00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:35,310
we really should work on on the language

00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:41,440
level to read out these terms that even

00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:43,630
if their success racist ablest there's

00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:47,320
so many different discrimination levers

00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:50,410
going on and we raise have to raise the

00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:55,740
awareness what we do with with language

00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:55,740
and how it affects other people

00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:01,460
thank you I will interpret this as we

00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:07,760
need to have more clear paper airplanes

00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:10,480
and yeah okay so I think from my

00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,370
experience is a lot face-to-face in

00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:16,280
interaction is the most powerful things

00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:19,700
like today I'm staying here I can see

00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,980
everyone in this room right so I think

00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:25,970
if you want to change or you want you

00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:27,800
know like a general issue you want to

00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:31,250
change the gender issue you want to

00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:34,790
improve it the face-to-face interaction

00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:37,370
is the most important because people you

00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:40,820
know you talk to the people and you get

00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:43,760
some feedback from the people and if you

00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:45,830
have a discussion which means you have a

00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:53,090
change chance you'll have an opportunity

00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:55,280
can change the people's mind yeah it's

00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:58,250
very importantly I see that many people

00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,430
are now watching her just kidding ok

00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:03,880
Abby and Palestine which steps you will

00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:06,170
take be taken to get more people

00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:10,190
actually yeah I've been there are only

00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:13,340
two requirements we need to take two

00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:17,780
actions we need to take one is we must

00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:24,280
have empathy to everyone because

00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:28,310
everyone is almost and the second is

00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:31,310
don't think you know everything because

00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:36,650
when you know more you won't know you

00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:38,930
know this I don't know if you get it you

00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:44,000
know more and you will know you know

00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:49,390
this if you if you know more

00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:51,810
so you know that many more

00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:55,000
many many things you don't know and

00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:59,160
there are the two key points I want to

00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:02,110
take out and I hope you just keeping my

00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:06,520
empathy and you don't know anything

00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:10,120
that's all thank you thank you thank you

00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:12,850
for everybody share and and just as some

00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:16,020
insight advertisement and young guys is

00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:19,660
organizing a diversity team and we

00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:22,120
really need more voices more especially

00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:24,340
from different people so please come

00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:27,430
join us and yeah we maybe will have a

00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:29,590
more the more thorough discussion of our

00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:32,310
progress and what can what we can do

00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,310
