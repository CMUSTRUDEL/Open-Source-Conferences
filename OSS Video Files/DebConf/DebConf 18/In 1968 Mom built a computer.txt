On the surface, this story shares vignettes about my Mom. But its purpose is to increase awareness of human resources in technology, and overlooked career pathways of women and other young technologists.

For example, In 1973 RCA hired her for self-directed projects in their chip prototyping lab. A marathon week of late-night needlework produced a crochet blanket and proved her mathematical mind to skeptical women co-workers. She told me stories of such ladies who wrapped wires for NASA a few years before. She said women's milleniums of technical fiber-crafts were acknowledged when they helped put men on the moon.

good evening and hello to everyone here

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,010
at DEP conf

00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:19,550
18 this is the next speech from

00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:23,510
Katherine satyr about in the 1968 month

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:27,350
built a computer woman's route to

00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:29,300
technique please give a warm welcome to

00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:35,810
Katherine

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,810
[Applause]

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:48,410
hello this is not the type of talk I

00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:51,710
normally do so I will put my applied

00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:57,530
social theory lens on it

00:00:51,710 --> 00:01:01,250
I go by Katherine Kathy and on IRC I am

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:03,260
dee lid I do applied social theory I

00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,140
have broad behavioral science background

00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,759
my bachelor's degree was focusing in

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,290
human development actually was

00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,500
interested in neuro chemistry and

00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,479
nutrition but in public health but I

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,430
when I went into I decided that the

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,649
political and policy questions were

00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:23,649
greater than the scientific questions

00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:27,050
I'd like to introduce an idea of

00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:32,420
legitimate peripheral participation and

00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:34,490
that that shapes a community differently

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,979
instead of thinking of newcomers coming

00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,610
in from the bottom and becoming and

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:42,200
going up towards the top of higher power

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,750
we think of a community is coming from

00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,450
of newcomers coming from the edges and

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,959
then judge how well do we bring those

00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,330
newcomers in how open and and permeable

00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,220
are the boundaries and do we give

00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,310
meaning to pull roles to new

00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:01,160
contributors and that is the lens I will

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:05,149
use to describe this story of my mother

00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:10,340
and difficulties and barriers she had to

00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:12,110
enter a career in tech so I never really

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,780
thought of my mother is very successful

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,780
but I also get irritated with mom jokes

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,910
and I'd like to say I think some of

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,560
these she might be unusual but it's too

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,200
bad I think there are many women and

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,510
many other people's stories that have

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,900
similar kinds of barriers so I'll try to

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:33,140
use her as an example notice in this

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,670
picture of a computer a plastic computer

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,459
you could build yourself they had

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,470
trouble marketing it so they're trying

00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,270
to tell people no really it's fun it's

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,190
not just really complicated sets of

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,739
things you have to put together and so

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,319
they put a father with a daughter in the

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:49,970
picture in the front with no if we had

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,549
had a son there you would think the

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,109
father was training the son but with a

00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,120
daughter it's more fun and enjoyable

00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:57,440
he's it's in

00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,790
testing that there's a little girl on

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,190
there my mother's life I'd like to start

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:08,599
the story with my grandfather he worked

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:10,730
for Presta president he was a fine

00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,569
woodworker and he created the molds for

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:17,989
their foundry their production of steel

00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:20,120
cookware in his off hours he's a very

00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,920
creative person he decided that the

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,290
complicated clamps on the pressure

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,840
cookers made them in a too complicated

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:30,349
and so he invented this way of putting a

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,840
lid on and turning it and my grandmother

00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:35,150
said that this is the reason why these

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,500
handles never fit woman's hands he

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:41,390
carved it for his own hand

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,370
my mother was trained by her mother in

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,930
the Depression era to be very very

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:49,489
frugal she learned she was very

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,790
interested they were all DIY they're

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:55,340
pioneers in the u.s. very hands-on kinds

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,400
of folks and lived in a small pioneer

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,760
town in Wisconsin and she learned this

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,630
kind of practical geometry in sewing

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,680
with her mother and she was very

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:11,599
interested in fabrics and quality but

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,299
she was the second child and they had no

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,340
boy so my grandfather said no let the

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,440
Gretchen come into the shop and work

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,049
with me I gave an example of the kind of

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,510
machinery of that era I don't have a

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:25,430
picture of his shop but she did things

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,169
like because he was disappointed that

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,810
this new pressure cooker that he'd

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:32,780
invented became belong to presto instead

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,699
of himself he decides formed his own

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,520
company and he hired my mother to work

00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,260
after school for many years so they for

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,720
example she would do the mathematics of

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,310
a dial too that would show if you want

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,229
to cook beef and your pressure cooker

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,520
how many minutes will it take and so she

00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:49,820
did all the math at the dining room

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:53,150
table to figure out how to do that she

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:55,039
in a college crafting in a college

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,810
drafting class that she took in a

00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:59,599
community college after high school she

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,840
did well and so her family

00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,460
sent her to art school and she always

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,969
said if I had been a boy they would have

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,290
realized I was really an engineer she

00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:12,350
wasn't she Hearst etics

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,010
wasn't so great but she was very

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,130
beautiful

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:19,070
at the time she there were some

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:22,070
technical jobs open for women she became

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,790
a sewing machine repair person and the

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,710
story I normally heard about that was

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,630
Kathy she didn't have much of a clothing

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,550
sense but she said just remember never

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,590
wear a red dress to a job interview and

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,750
then she would tell the story of how she

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:39,490
wore red dress to this job interview and

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:43,250
the boss took her to a conference and

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:46,910
only booked one room in the motel and so

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:49,430
she left because and then she said the

00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,870
default was that she didn't know you're

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:56,960
not supposed to wear a red dress to a

00:05:50,870 --> 00:06:00,520
job interview when she married my father

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,230
and we went to Germany for the US Army

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,630
she had a great love and that was her

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,180
father

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:10,550
3:32 sewing machine very absorbed in it

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,890
this picture of the inner workings of it

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,870
this is her passion I've seen her she

00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,930
taught me on this not this exact machine

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,930
but this model all my life and she

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,950
didn't really teach me about clothes or

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,750
making clothes but she taught me about

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,500
the mechanics of the machine and how to

00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,540
use it

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,790
Elvis Presley was on the base at that

00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,300
time she really wasn't very impressed

00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,500
with him but she really loved the best

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,830
german-engineered sewing machine she had

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:40,910
ever seen oh that's me in the little

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:45,220
picture with my mom as a single mother

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:47,300
she found a job as a department store

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,060
detective meaning she was a secret

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,840
shopper and she complained that the

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,400
managers were watching the women in the

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,170
dressing rooms and making and making

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,730
rude jokes about them through the

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:04,510
two-way mirrors and she was fired she

00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,510
became a waitress

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:11,620
later she had a job with a vending

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:14,650
machine maintenance company she would

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:17,259
travel around and she found out through

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,780
some kind of social event that the men

00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:22,240
were making extremely more money than

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:27,550
she was doing the same work maybe less

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,979
and she asked why they made more money

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:33,520
and Cator matt told her it was because

00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:35,530
they had families to support but she had

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,120
three children in a one-room a partner

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,560
one-bedroom apartment that she could not

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,509
tell them about or she would not be

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,430
allowed to have the job a single woman

00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:47,380
with three children she was not a very

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,630
happy person but she found things to

00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,520
keep herself busy and feeling like she

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,270
was working somewhere into the future

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,930
she in the 1960s there are many of these

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:01,300
electronics mail-order courses offered

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,070
in the newspapers and she signed up for

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,789
one of these and she studied it in her

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,330
spare time after working full time as a

00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:10,810
Mercator map

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:13,720
I remember it was 68 or 69 because at

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:16,300
that time I remember her waking us up to

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,949
watch this vision of a man stepping on

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,659
the moon and how excited she was we had

00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,940
very little money sometimes there was

00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:27,610
not enough money for dinner to have a

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,760
good meal but for fun we would go on

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,409
Saturdays to a flea market and she would

00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,240
give us each fifty cents or a dollar we

00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,159
could buy anything she we wanted and

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,279
what she would buy with me were these

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,289
appliances a toaster

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,589
an oven that looked like this one and

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:46,120
this photographic equipment and she

00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,800
would fix them and that would be our

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,329
entertainment and things to do for fun

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,040
during the week one night I woke up in

00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:56,170
the middle of the night and I went out

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,209
to the dining room and I was tired and

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,190
now my mother's very tired person right

00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:02,170
she works very hard and she had all

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,329
these plastic pieces all over the table

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,880
red and white and all these lines and

00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:09,130
these pieces of tape and labels and like

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,190
were they doing I was just coming to get

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:16,499
a glass of water and she said look Kathy

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,809
it's a computer what's that

00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:20,369
you know you can help me here help me

00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,169
sort this in this and she gave me the

00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:24,439
instruction manual and I looked at it

00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:26,609
and I was too tired I went back to bed

00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,229
but she worked on that for a long time

00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:33,269
and she was very excited that she made

00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:36,749
it work remember at the time the

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:41,849
computers looked like this but she had

00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:44,069
one on her own kitchen table so other

00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:46,679
ways in which she was technical Silent

00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:49,349
Spring by Rachel Carson this book is

00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,879
about the pesticides and environmental

00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:52,529
hazards that we were all very very

00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,199
frightened by when it was came out we

00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:58,529
all read that vitamin C and the common

00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,169
cold by Linus Pauling talking about this

00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:04,709
idea of these molecules called amino

00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:06,959
acids and other vitamins meaning they

00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:10,769
were absolutely required for life and

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,869
how you shouldn't eat foods that lose

00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:15,839
these things for vitamins and then how

00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:18,659
to eat Adelle Davis was her favorite

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:23,819
author probably all her life and Linus

00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:27,659
Pauling finally still working full time

00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:30,539
now as a housekeeper as a maid doing

00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,979
housecleaning the US government started

00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:38,339
funding this thing called community

00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:40,109
colleges and I remember she the slide

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,299
rule became the thing that made her

00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:43,859
happy she had just tried to teach me how

00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,859
to use the slide rule and she was so

00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:48,989
excited about it and the algebra and the

00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:50,819
no careful notes she would take she

00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:52,499
wanted to go for a nutrition degree but

00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:55,159
she had to she couldn't use that much

00:10:52,499 --> 00:11:01,289
time so she got a two-year degree as a

00:10:55,159 --> 00:11:02,879
chemical technician she applied for a

00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:06,539
job with that chemical technician degree

00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,789
at RCA Radio Corporation of America and

00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:12,059
they said that at the time they had many

00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:14,339
applicants like her but the reason she

00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,139
stood out is they had never before met

00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:20,339
anyone to finish a home electronics

00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:22,619
course home electronics course this

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:26,069
correspondence where you make something

00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:28,199
electronic and then send it mail it to

00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:29,070
the company and they grade it and mail

00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,200
it you then

00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,450
assignment and then grade you a test all

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,860
done by mail and so people would start

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,210
these things I'd never finished them and

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,400
she finished them and they said that's

00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,400
the reason she they gave her the that

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,830
they gave her that job so I found this

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,540
photo of the folks that she worked with

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,610
because these are the folks in the older

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,610
facility before the Somerville facility

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:56,340
was built and about three years before

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,750
and they look like what I remember

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:02,160
because at the time I was in high school

00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:04,710
and they looked like that and she talked

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,710
about them so she was given a special

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,570
she had some ideas about how to fit the

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:12,180
electronics on a silicon chip into a

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,910
smaller form factor this is what they

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,130
were working on she had ideas that they

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,870
found interesting and they gave her

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,630
permission to do special projects where

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,190
she had access to the entire laboratory

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,660
this is stepping on the toes of the more

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,380
senior women who have been there a long

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,120
time

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:32,100
and in order to gain their trust she

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:37,440
wasn't really into it but at lunchtime

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:40,650
they did crocheting so she would she's

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,170
told me that what she did was she let

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,000
them teach her how to crochet and then

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:48,330
she went home and stayed up around the

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,160
clock for much of a week to impress them

00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,540
with how fast she put out this crochet

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,640
blanket that was better than what they

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,250
had taught her to do and she gained

00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,100
their trust she also told me the story

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,080
of how I don't know if it was these

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,220
women but women of these this generation

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,770
and for all I know it might have been

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,200
some of these women who would take their

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,660
very fine motor skills and their

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,320
experience but with fiber work and had

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:15,780
been wrapping wires for the computer

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,610
systems for NASA and this was an

00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,900
inspiring story for her and she would

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,550
make fun of these old ladies that were

00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,960
more impressed by crochet but she was

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,210
very proud of how well she had done at

00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,250
it so the thing that she was working on

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,930
you'll notice in this slide it's talking

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,480
about the layers and the silicon chips

00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,850
and the way the circuits are attached to

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,020
each other in this particular chip what

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,090
they were trying to do was make it

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,710
smaller and they were finding what how

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,080
she explained to me what they were doing

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,680
is that they would were trying to get

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,319
the

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,959
Irv's she was working on how to make the

00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:48,209
curves connect more tightly and

00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,920
eventually they found a different

00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:51,990
crystal structure that made that easier

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,300
which is interesting because she married

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,259
a world-renowned material physicist at

00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,629
the time and they would talk about

00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:02,759
things like crystal structures I believe

00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:07,139
this may have been the very chip that

00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,730
she was working on it's because it I

00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:12,569
found a research report that was

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:14,249
Declassified out of RCA from 1974 it

00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:15,540
looks vaguely like the pictures I

00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:17,730
remember when I was a child although I

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,550
wouldn't go by that she said that she

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,199
imaged a picture of me as a baby on one

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:27,569
of the layers but I don't think it's

00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:30,629
findable and apparently it was very

00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:32,999
unusual for the time this was her dream

00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:39,689
job she was the happiest I had ever seen

00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:41,879
her in my life she bonded with my faut

00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:45,300
my stepfather over their shared

00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:47,879
technical interests this is a computer I

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,769
believe is the one that they built in

00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,529
the kitchen table and made sure that we

00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:54,059
were not part of it parts of computer

00:14:52,529 --> 00:15:00,179
all over the table all over the place

00:14:54,059 --> 00:15:01,649
for quite a while I had a TRS 102 that I

00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:03,389
played with but I thought I'd pick up

00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:07,860
this picture it just reminded me at the

00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:13,429
kind of magazines around the house so

00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:18,649
then it turns out that her job bumped my

00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:23,339
military and corporate CEOs kind of

00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:27,499
stepfathers tax bracket higher than her

00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:30,600
income brought in so she quit the job

00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:34,499
but so I didn't think of that as a

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,249
success and she was very unhappy but

00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:39,509
this is a picture of my mother happy I

00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:41,279
don't remember what program she was

00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:42,779
learning but she was expected because

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,369
she was writing programming she was

00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:46,709
learning programming and she was happy

00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:49,350
about it and this is a computer she was

00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:51,540
using at the time I didn't actually I

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,420
had already gone off to University of

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,580
Illinois

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,620
at that time but when I would come back

00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:02,350
home this was a closet off of the

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:04,570
kitchen where she did her work this was

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,060
in Chicago at this time I didn't grow up

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,830
there but at this time during college

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:14,710
they were he was working for Standard

00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:17,770
Oil of Indiana so my summary so what are

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:20,410
the take-home lessons here I think that

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,140
all of these these not really happy

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:27,280
aspects of this story can be summarized

00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:29,380
as a lack of the pathways or access to

00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,720
legitimate peripheral participation in

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,620
tech she did these things that showed

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,630
her capacity her knowledge her

00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,030
enthusiasm but at each step because she

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,350
was female these little hurdles kept

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:45,490
getting thrown at her that were big

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:48,810
enough to derail her so poor access to

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:51,190
meaningful work on the edges

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:55,960
inappropriately tracked into traditional

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:57,850
women's roles but also persistence and

00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:02,560
cleverness in finding new entry points

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:05,320
into technology I'm sorry this isn't a

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,089
happier story for me to tell I really

00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,440
appreciate you guys listening and I

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:19,180
think this is the end of this part of

00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:25,000
the talk there's a time check sorry

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:26,490
remember five minutes I think an

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,320
interesting thing to talk about would be

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,030
how does a newcomer who doesn't look

00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,980
like the people in the center of the

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:39,480
group become get given roles that allow

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,480
them become more central

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,740
so hi thank you very much for the talk

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:06,140
it was really very interesting so

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,380
personally I can totally relate to the

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,270
topic because I have finished for

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,580
International Affairs and diplomacy so

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:17,300
which means that I have a background in

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:21,740
social sciences and recently I've been

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,660
learning Python as I see that the the

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,059
future kind of of the market of the

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,780
place that I'm living is requiring a lot

00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:31,400
of people that has technical skills so

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:35,059
how do you think that those two things

00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,340
things can merge together and can create

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:40,250
in your hand something that it's very

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,920
nice and can be useful are you asking

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:46,340
for career advice no I am asking how can

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:48,500
you combine those two things and can

00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,380
make it like so people can not just be

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,620
technical or just be in the social field

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,620
but they can somehow merge those two

00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,210
things together and can come up with

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,670
something nice because I heard in the

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,720
beginning of the presentations that you

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:08,030
were in the that you were the science

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,090
part but then thought to go more in the

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:14,300
social the social aspect so more it's

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:17,210
like why do you have to do this right

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,220
this exchange I think that's a great

00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,830
question it's often a gendered question

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,620
so one of the things that you can sit

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:29,780
down I mean if you want to stand there

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:31,190
it's fine but okay here's one of the

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:36,170
Bugaboos one of the things that annoys

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:37,940
me is that social policy is being set by

00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:41,660
technically minded people right now who

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,160
tend to be young men how people should

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,280
get along with each other tends to be

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,500
women's work that's no big deal we have

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,960
plenty of women who can work on it but

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,420
because technically minded men have are

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,110
so needed right now I had such a high

00:19:53,420 --> 00:20:00,950
demand get constant praise by your

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:02,600
skills and abilities and knowledge and I

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,090
find this more so among engineers than

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,760
among scientists scientists are more ten

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,620
in general the scientific field tends to

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,289
be more excited by questions

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,750
and engineers my my stereotype are more

00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:16,400
interested in the answers right so one

00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,830
of the problems I see is not knowing

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,450
where your own blind spots are you look

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,309
for a technical solution on something

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:28,789
when the goal hasn't been set up

00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:31,340
correctly so how do you bring in for in

00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,870
this example someone the woman's work

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,640
you know what oh they're in reap and

00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:38,480
human resources how much power do they

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,159
have so I know that's not a complete

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,529
answer to your question but I think it's

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,149
it's part of the problem yeah I'm being

00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:51,590
told I have one minute anybody wanted to

00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:54,559
say anything else okay

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:59,210
so I've been thinking about this how to

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,399
come from the edge to the center and in

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:04,390
debía specifically like we do a lot of

00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:07,480
effort to acknowledge contributions from

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:11,600
contributors in different areas so

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:14,779
artists lawyers or and we have the non

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,750
upload uploading Dedes and I'm afraid

00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:20,659
that when we accept acknowledged

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:25,419
contributions contributors in those

00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:32,679
areas and we tag them as I need to be

00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:35,570
now when when we when let's say a new

00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:38,929
developer enters the community as an

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:43,190
unemployed in Gigi for instance it it's

00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:47,240
hard then to break the to cross the line

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:50,779
and become an unemployed in DG so when

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:55,399
you enter the community by the edge with

00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:58,130
a small contribution translating or so

00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,809
where is the meaningful path an example

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,179
when I was reading about this theory of

00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:04,460
participation on the periphery and

00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:07,010
making it legitimate an example was used

00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,169
as a butcher shop in an old butcher shop

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,940
the head butcher would be in the middle

00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:13,490
but the assistant butchers would be

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,220
somewhere nearby doing more menial tasks

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:18,620
but they always had visual access and

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,380
could see the more advanced positions

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,990
and so over time and with opportunity

00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,970
and

00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:27,750
need they could step into those roles

00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,460
yeah but then that's the disability it's

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,850
really hard I think when we have

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:36,030
separate roles and then for the

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:39,510
migration like if we as a community are

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,950
not with a good eye on that like to give

00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,140
opportunity for those people that we

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,840
already said you you are this kind of

00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,210
contributor and you are and then on

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,120
Tuesday I'm forgetting the time I will

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,470
be facilitating a conversation between

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,960
any team members who would like to

00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,610
arrive to talk about how teams can help

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,340
each other in terms of how they govern

00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,840
their groups and it include questions of

00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,450
how to bringing in new Clippers if

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,170
people want to yeah thank you very much

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,089
everybody

00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:09,089
