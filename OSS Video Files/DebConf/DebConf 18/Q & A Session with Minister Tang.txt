our deaf cough 18 and I don't even have

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,189
to even have to tell him what to say

00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:35,540

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,210
projection here and for the rest of this

00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:37,409
hour I guess the next 15 minutes I'll

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,930
begin with a short introduction maybe 15

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,539
minutes maybe 20 minutes about my work

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,609
in the Taiwan administration in the

00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:47,100
public digital innovation space the

00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:49,109
Peters is are seeing here but me

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,000
meanwhile as I'm talking feel free to

00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,280
ask me any and all questions which was

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,100
showing the phone here and once there's

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,670
sufficient number of questions then I'll

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,820
switch right back to you I do my current

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:07,460
favorite programming language is text /

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:11,540
plain characters at utf-8

00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,520
yeah it's one of the most versatile

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,580
programming language there is and I'll

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,260
explore that more in my talk I'm sure

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,890
it's your favorite programming language

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,400
too

00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:26,450
okay so so let's get started

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,660
so unlike many people working on

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,340
democracy today I'm a optimist when it

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,010
comes to democracy and especially

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,410
internet democracy this strange

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,769
condition began when I was 15 years old

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,930
there was 1996 I discovered that a

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,910
future of human knowledge and indeed

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,910
future if democracy is happening on the

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,459
web and my education in the school is

00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,620
out of date so I told my teachers that I

00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:53,810
found this wonderful constitutional

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,290
democracy called Debian no really I did

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,290
on the Internet where people use counter

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,269
set methods and there's very advanced

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,060
algorithms and you know policy

00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:07,040
development process and so on and I want

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,010
to quit school and became my education

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,780
on the web and surprisingly my teachers

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,690
were very reasonable people and they all

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,670
agree with it and so after that I just

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,220
drop out of high school and started a

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:22,280
few web startups and just participate in

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,680
this wonderful community of like the

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,070
Internet Society and the open source and

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,530
free software communities to basically

00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,230
see that how people can come to

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,299
consensus or at least consent through

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,100
radical transparency and rough consensus

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,840
and so on and so today I'm Thomas

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,489
digital Minister for a year and half now

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,200
I'm applying the lessons that I learned

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:44,450
when I was 15 years old

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,660
that is to say civic participation rough

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,820
consensus radical transparency to the

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,320
representative democratic system here

00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:56,630
and surprisingly is working and is

00:03:51,320 --> 00:04:00,470
changing gradually our society now right

00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:03,260
so so a year ago two years ago actually

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,959
when President saying when first became

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,239
inaugurated as our president she said a

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,730
inspiring statement in her inauguration

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,920
speech she said before when we think of

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,820
democracy we think about the opposition

00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:19,130
between two opposing values but now from

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,770
now on Taiwan's democracy need to be

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,500
come a conversation between many diverse

00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:27,470
values so the key point here in the is

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,810
the plural of this word value

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,260
so there's many values in Taiwan and

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,880
we're going to build a conversational

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,360
deliberative democracy out of there is

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,310
very different but diverse values and

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,440
indeed previously when people think

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,480
about the government or the state are

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,280
things like that people tend to have

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,500
this picture like we have different

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,030
departments we have different ministries

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,860
we had different council within the

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,510
Parliament who talk to you for example

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,760
the environmental agents you may talk to

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,410
the environmentalist groups the Minister

00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,360
of Economy may talk to you know

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,370
developmental you know more capitalistic

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,440
groups and so on so there's different

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,210
notes within the government to talk to

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,670
the different sides of stakeholders and

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,680
people imagined that the government is

00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,530
what brings people together and what who

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,810
arbitrates between those conflicting or

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,360
opposing forces now this model of

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,760
covenants as all of you know has become

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,460
bankrupt within the previous decade or

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,280
so with the advent of the social web and

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,990
indeed internet activism and the reason

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,990
is that people can organize now

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,690
perfectly fine without a representative

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,640
organizer from the mainstream media or

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,770
from the representative democracy and

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,540
also because there's so many emerging

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,640
issues we can't have a different

00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,160
ministry or a different agency for each

00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,960
of them and so if the government insists

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,000
on being still this kind of rope in

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,070
between not only this is organizational

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,020
value much lower than before it would be

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,540
torn between so many different interests

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,790
that it become paralyzed and so the

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,100
distance between the government and

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,140
people while not increasing the distance

00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,720
between people and people have much

00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,820
shortened and it leads to a recession or

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,670
it is trust to the democratic

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,800
institutions so the way we're working on

00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:13,340
this is basically reimagine the

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,050
questions governance systems ask instead

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,900
of asking you know who we need to

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,060
represent or what is fair arbitration

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,190
with us instead what is the due process

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,680
in which that the various different

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,780
stakeholders can find common values and

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,640
given the common values can we come up

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,940
with solutions that works for everyone

00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,090
that everyone can live

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,250
with and so this is the idea of civic

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,770
tech or basically technology that

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:42,390
enabled people to listen to one another

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:44,130
and this has basically a lot of

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,600
international metrics measuring this

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:50,190
like the diversity of gender and

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,430
participation in the internet like the

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:56,520
rank of like open data and accessibility

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,110
like the access to participation

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,870
platforms and things like that

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,670
and since 2015 no one has been

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,280
consistently ranked number one or number

00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:07,590
two in all of those metrics worldwide

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,050
and a reason is that at the end of 2014

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,450
there's a radical u-turn of national

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,430
direction by embracing the wisdom of the

00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,590
crowd and open government as the

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,080
national direction and it was kind of

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,440
catalyzed and it's epitomized by a

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,660
Occupy movement back in 2014 where

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,440
people occupy the parliament for 22 days

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,390
in a non-violent demonstration and when

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,430
we say demonstration we mean it in like

00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,950
the demo day sense right is a demo

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,810
because at a time the members of the

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,700
Parliament have one refused to

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,380
deliberate a cross-strait service trade

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,210
agreement because they think

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,250
constitutionally Beijing is part of

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,430
Taiwan or something like that but in any

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:50,820
case they refuse to deliberate a

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:53,010
statement a treaty and so people occupy

00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,919
the parliament and it the MPS work for

00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:58,320
them by basically deliberating line by

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,960
line what the service trade pact entails

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,760
and there's more than 20 different NGOs

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,860
in all the different streets around the

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,560
Parliament in a non-violent way just

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,130
celebrating aspects of this cross-strait

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,900
service agreement and I was part of the

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,810
movement they supported the logistics

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,150
and the ICT communication for this

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,850
movement and it's called g0v that

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,890
heatedly or just cuffs zero and the idea

00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,470
of curves here is very simple for any

00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:29,070
Taiwan government services that are and

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,620
in govt that DW which is registered this

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,900
domain g0v that TW so the people

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,580
whenever they see a government service a

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,280
website that's not to the people's

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,440
liking they can just fork that website

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,740
and build a more interactive open

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,230
version that just trend changes the Oh

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,390
to a zero on your URL and it's very easy

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,810
to discover it softer discoverability

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,220
problems so like for the legislation

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,690
legislative you NGO v TW the

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,750
corresponding shadow government is just

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,779
L white a 2-0 V that is very easy to

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:04,980
remember it's a very neat hack right so

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:07,830
the first the first project of the graph

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,560
theorem movement back in 2012 before I

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,480
joined was called budget to 0 v TW and

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,550
it's essentially an interactive platform

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,500
they shows a visualization of the

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,050
national budget and everybody can just

00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,670
look on the part the specific project

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,170
that they are interested in if a

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,990
real-time discussion on the discussion

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,850
forum sent around that budget item as

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,880
the social object instead of on the

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,920
budget as a whole and the idea again is

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,570
forking the government and usually the

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,910
gov serie projects are and they're free

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,250
software license or really the creative

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,860
commons 0 license which is not a license

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,690
is just a declaration to donation to the

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,339
public domain and the result is that

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,540
when the state level government at the

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,459
end of 2014

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,380
want to incorporate this into like the

00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:51,149
participatory budget program and things

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,649
like they don't have to ask anyone they

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:55,170
just take the graph theory of forked

00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:56,850
versions and merge it back to the state

00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,680
level governments and so far it is like

00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,600
seven different cities adopting this a

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,880
nest of this year the national

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,459
government also merged this in so that

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,120
today enjoying that govt that TWU can

00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:12,029
see order 1,300 national projects and

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,410
all its KPIs is deliverables and things

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,570
like that and have a real time

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,060
discussion wisdom career public servants

00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,810
in charge of that governmental project

00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,430
essentially bypassing the representative

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:26,130
democratic system and so it enables a

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,440
real discussion so what why are there so

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,180
many civic hackers in Taiwan who during

00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,020
the sunflower movement just a lot like

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,640
me I just you know talk to my clients

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,529
that I need to take a three-week leave

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,050
because democracy needs me right there's

00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:42,660
hundreds of people who did add back in

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,540
2014 and why is that because I think I'm

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,240
37 now we're the first generation in

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,270
Taiwan that can actually do democracy

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,620
after three decades of martial law which

00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,290
was lifted

00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,330
1989 around the time of personal

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,060
computers and we only had our first

00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,190
presidential election 1996 which is

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,740
about a year of the pulverization of the

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,660
wyoweb so internet and democracy there

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,370
are not two things they are not two

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,440
different branches people is the same

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,930
generation people it's the same things I

00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,030
want and so the advent of democracy and

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,130
Aven of Internet and direct democracy

00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,560
it's the same time in Taiwan we don't

00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,960
have like 200 or 300 years of a

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,910
representative democracy tradition when

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,090
we had democracy we had also the

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:29,220
internet so in Taiwan when we see or

00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,200
when we talk about free software we

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,500
translate it as to the use of it's

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,780
always free as in freedom to you know

00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,330
assemble freedom of speech freedom to

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,490
express and never free of cost because

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,740
we know that freedom is never free of

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,300
costs our parents generation our

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,640
grandparents generation fought very hard

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,010
to get those freedoms and it's up to us

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,580
to use the software freedoms to keep the

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:56,970
society free and so at the end of 2014

00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:59,160
and after the Occupy there's many mayors

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,470
mayor candidates who were occupy

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,600
supporters or occupiers themselves who

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,720
very surprisingly found themselves

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,070
elected mayors when they did not expect

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,910
it's something that also happen in Spain

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:14,850
also right and in many other you know

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:17,670
occupies in that time and so at a time

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,440
the premiere during the Occupy are

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,330
resigned to saying I don't understand

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,180
you people and so he just resigned and a

00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,370
new crate premia engineer said okay so

00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,140
from now on crowdsourcing and open

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,510
governance is just going to be in a

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,120
national direction and so the occupiers

00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:35,550
and us the supporters of the occupies

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,070
the facilitators and the ICT experts

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:41,370
were then hired into the national

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:44,010
government in 20 30 2015 to helped

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:47,990
designing systems to collaboratively

00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:51,540
solve issues such as over at a time and

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:54,270
uber in 2015 has entered Taiwan and

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,010
operated legally using rental cars and

00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,430
professional drivers for a while

00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:01,920
but in 2015 they also introduced a new

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,230
line of service called uber X and it is

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,350
using unlicensed drivers and

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:10,530
licensed cars and without insurance and

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,540
the PR idea of uber at the time is to

00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,010
use this min.i which is a virus of the

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,010
mind right this meme

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,360
sharing economy this mean means very

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,120
different thing to very different people

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,310
but for the uber PR department at the

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,940
time it means very specifically that

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:29,790
code dispatch cars better than lost so

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,530
we obey a code not lost so it is like

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,990
very simple message that there spreads

00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:37,710
around the world it's not just in Taiwan

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:40,230
and so it's a like epidemic of the minds

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,790
of people after becoming a driver for a

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,350
couple of weeks maybe they feel that

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,030
there's no protection that they didn't

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,100
actually earn that much and they quit

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,870
driving for over X but during that two

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,700
weeks time just like a common flu they

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,650
would have spread through apps to their

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,530
passengers and to other drivers and to

00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:58,830
other passengers and so it's impossible

00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:01,140
actually at a time for us to negotiate

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,940
with with an app or with a virus of a my

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,350
like the sharing economy quote-unquote

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,630
because it's in a different category

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,360
it's impossible to argue was to come off

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:11,910
flu Ida right so Edison many state

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,250
governments try used both world methods

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,470
such as confiscating like in Paris that

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,540
confiscated office confiscated machines

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,760
for people to jail and then the next

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,830
morning goober still operates right so

00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,620
it doesn't really work in the O's

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,600
governmental methods and so we thought

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,820
about it and we thought that you know

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,850
during the Occupy where people listen to

00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,190
each other's positions deeply and feel

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,500
each other's feelings around the cssta

00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:40,040
maybe we can reuse some of that

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,480
technique and to work on the uber issue

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,730
basically we think that deliberation is

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,100
a vaccine of the mind once people have

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,470
really felt and empathized with

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,360
different decides positions and come up

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,660
with common values people become immune

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:58,200
to specific virus of the mind in the

00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,630
future so I promise to check the

00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,800
questions at this point so I'm just

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,800
going to do it right now

00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:14,370
right there's 17 questions

00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:16,170
maybe I'll just alright so I'll finish

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,240
this section and this which right back

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,570
to questions so a proper deliberation

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,900
involves four different stages we used a

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,670
system invented in Canada in 2005 is

00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:30,300
called a focused conversation method or

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:32,370
FCM and it's known as the Oh RIT method

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,260
also because it separates the discussion

00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,290
into four different stages the first is

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:39,390
objective or facts where people ask each

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,240
other like the government publishes open

00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,980
data all we know about rubrics and we

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,860
also ask all the private sector and

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,500
civil society to donate data into the

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,360
shared fact-checked database and once

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,220
people check the facts on the timeline

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,410
we can all agree with the facts the

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,360
various stakeholders then express their

00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,190
feelings for the same fact you may feel

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,950
angry and I may feel happy and it is all

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,590
okay and it's not until we checked

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,420
everybody's feelings that we find that

00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,730
there are some resonating feelings that

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,240
people offer as important concerns to

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,460
id8 so after the facts the feelings is

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,080
the ideas the best ideas are the ideas

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,170
that takes care of the most people's

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,350
feelings and once we uncover those ideas

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:25,170
that we then translate into legalese now

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:28,140
using the ODE governmental message the

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,510
main area is the language barrier the

00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,520
professional public servants the private

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,470
secretary lobbyists and the independence

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,360
like academics and so on use a

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,250
professional language while people on

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,600
the street using a different language

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:44,670
and so under this under this situation

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,220
when people say the same thing but mean

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,680
very different things the facts and the

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,320
feelings gets clouded and ideas in this

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,210
environment become ideologies ideology

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,490
sorry even more potent virus of mind

00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:59,010
that blinds people to new facts into

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:01,320
each other's feelings and so after we

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:04,170
get everybody on the same page checking

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,110
the facts that by itself is important we

00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,280
use a free software system under a GPL

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,610
are called

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,800
police and police is a so-called AI

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:16,319
power conversation that basically just

00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,870
provides a face to the proud so we ask

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,199
every

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:22,540
to basically look at one statement that

00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,329
dear friends are just a random person on

00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:28,270
the internet propose about their feeling

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:30,750
their their country wrote you a de

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,770
something so I think that or I feel that

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,660
passenger liability insurance is

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,360
important so as you agree or disagree

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:40,480
with the statements your avatar will

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,130
move among your social media friends or

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,350
you don't have to login among well-known

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,660
people on social media so that you can

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,280
discover that so your friends and your

00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,260
family actually think about this in a

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,580
very different perspective but they're

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,770
still your friends and family just

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,860
didn't talk about this over dinner so it

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,480
makes it difficult for people to

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,580
antagonize to treat people with

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,860
different viewpoints as enemies but

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,540
rather it enables people to say that

00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,790
okay after answering a few years or no

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,890
questions I can also contribute my

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,690
feelings and people kind of compete our

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,500
feelings that resonates with the most

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,420
number of people because we say if your

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,880
ideas or if your feelings resonates with

00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:21,160
a supermajority amount of people that is

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,870
across all the groups every group has

00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,630
more than majority agreeing with you

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,760
then the feelings and proposals with the

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,700
most resonance with the most consensus

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,410
we use that as the agenda to talk with

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,290
the stakeholders with the taxi unions

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,210
with the uber people and so on and so in

00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:40,270
this way we send the same URL to

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,950
everybody and they spread it and one of

00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,780
the key interface design is the

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,990
decisions during a polis discussion

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,940
unlike many other social media venues is

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:52,210
that you don't see the reply button here

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,850
there is no reply and what we discovered

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,340
is if you have reply people focus their

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,380
energy on discrediting the person who

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,500
posted a comment that they don't agree

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,670
with but like slide oh polis basically

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,580
if you see something that you don't

00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,809
agree with your best recourse is to

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,240
prepare something more nuanced that

00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:12,100
other people can agree with and so after

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,870
a few weeks in all the police

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,490
discussions all we see is that people

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,260
recognize their differences in those

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,309
devices statements but they don't spend

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,280
more time on it

00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:24,010
and people instead spent a lot of time

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,660
refining the new instance Ensis so that

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,090
people can resonate kind of

00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,250
Pete with the most resonance across the

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,840
different groups and so we use a live

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,060
consultation method where all the

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,580
stakeholders are invited at the taxi

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,370
company uber Union people and so on the

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:42,280
co-ops and so on and we just checked

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,770
wisdom or the agenda set by this police

00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,900
conversation one by one saying do you

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,700
agree and if you don't want if you do

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,620
why and because it's livestream with

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,080
thousands of people watching people

00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,120
become bound to whatever they have said

00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,100
so over at the time said okay so we'll

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,110
work with our drivers to help them

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,120
obtain professional driver's license and

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,750
they're bound by the words they spoke at

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,940
this livestream meeting and so just

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,800
after this we then work on ratifying the

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,560
new what we call the diversification of

00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,880
taxi and one of the mid highest score is

00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,980
actually contributed by the free

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,260
software community by Irvin from the

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,030
Mozilla community here who said that we

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,400
should take this opportunity to upgrade

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,410
the taxi regulations so that the best

00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,670
practice is from from uber for example

00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,710
text it doesn't have to be painted

00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,480
yellow and there's a two way rating

00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,420
system and so on could be used to

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,240
facilitate better taxi qualities here in

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,910
Taiwan and so led by that consensus and

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,980
six other consensus items we then

00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,840
created a law so that now uber is

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,240
operating legally in Taiwan but only

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,430
with registered driver's license cars

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,280
and you also get email about your price

00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:50,290
and insurance and so on every uber ride

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,700
and you can also call taxi use uber and

00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,010
actually vice versa

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,900
and so this is what we call a multi

00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,450
stakeholder consultation and after which

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,270
people's consensus set agenda for the

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,630
politicians to talk about so let's take

00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,630
some questions

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:14,010
so there's 13 people I think 15 now

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,289
would like to know how can we help other

00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,700
governments enable open standards this

00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:21,770
is an excellent question

00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:26,280
so in Taiwan we have this idea of the

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:29,610
GDS B or the government digital service

00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:32,159
principle it is modeled loosely after

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,380
the GD the government digital service in

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,409
the UK will also publish their digital

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,870
standards and the GDS is kind of a

00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:42,150
thought leader in this area and they

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,820
pioneered a lot of digital standards

00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:47,280
that are not just open as in open source

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,409
or open as an open protocol or format

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,929
but open as an open innovation where

00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:55,650
people everybody can contribute and one

00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:58,350
of their key principles is being used

00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:01,650
their centric which we hear expanded in

00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:04,230
Taiwan meaning that the users here not

00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:06,390
only include citizens but also people

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,940
working in the front line in the public

00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:12,630
service and the second thing that the UK

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,370
GDS also basically advocates is that

00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,169
when you build a digital service you

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,210
need not to only test with people and

00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:20,340
the frontline staff but also test with

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,200
the minister in the cabinet from the

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,179
beginning to the end because ultimately

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,789
they are accountable for this digital

00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:29,309
service and they can then solicit more

00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:32,730
idea of an innovation from this service

00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:36,210
and again we adopted this spirit and

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:39,240
also cover the leader to be basically

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:41,480
cross-disciplinary but I think the

00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,770
person who asked this question is may be

00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:50,820
most interested in our GDS P number 8

00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:55,650
which says open first basically open is

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:58,500
the priority and basically to reduce the

00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:02,490
time spent on developing services and

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,980
the total cost of ownership open should

00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:07,950
be the foremost principle when designing

00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,260
and building services and by open we

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,110
mean specifically that order

00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:15,299
machine-to-machine data

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:17,990
built by this system need to be

00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:19,820
available under a open license most

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:23,030
only the creative commons attribution

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:25,460
4.0 license which is the default license

00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:29,030
for all the ICT systems built in taiwan

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:31,820
and also we prioritized open source and

00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:34,520
if they serviced componentry uses

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,050
existing open source components we

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:40,010
recommend people to use Linux

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:43,400
foundations speedix or SPD X manifest to

00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:45,290
basically solve this warranty issue for

00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,080
the system integrators because once they

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:51,110
declare their reusable free software

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,850
components under speedix the warranty in

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,120
the legal perspective has a clear

00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:58,490
delineation and so by this we want to

00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,440
encourage people to innovate based on

00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,929
what the government has delivered and

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,150
improve on existing government services

00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:06,320
by forking the government and occasion

00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,990
like getting a right and getting

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,880
government's merging it back but not

00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,130
only open data and open source we also

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,530
say that it need to conform with open

00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,350
standards and so that it could be reused

00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:20,510
and also it's built on common API and

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,700
common components and all this is so

00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:25,370
that we can quickly reiterate and

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,940
improve the services and so we have a

00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:32,179
support group of other governments who

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,760
endorse this as the standard it's called

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,429
digital Nations and previously known as

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,860
digital 5 or digital 7 depending on the

00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:42,080
number of people in it but we have a

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,950
chat channel we share github

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,290
repositories we basically communicate

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:50,000
very regularly so so that the

00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:53,510
government's who embrace open by default

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,720
has this venue and I think our next

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,300
meeting is in forward 50 in Ottawa in

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,400
Canada this this November and so

00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:04,250
basically all the governments are

00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,200
solving very much similar issues and all

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:09,170
the components that we deliver is not

00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,059
just for improvement of our citizens but

00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:13,429
also offering it so that it could be

00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:15,140
reused by the government and people

00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,240
building their own self governance

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,860
system not necessarily state government

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,140
or representative governments were

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:24,860
allies so the short answer to this is to

00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:27,350
develop and adhere to a clear government

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:30,020
digital service principle to publish and

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,130
circulate this widely to encourage it as

00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,960
in the procurement

00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,180
and to encourage this in the

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,070
accountability in the auditing laws in

00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,230
the statistics laws which we all have

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,690
done and then participate

00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,390
internationally in support groups in the

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,890
democratic and open governance

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,300
governments and basically share these

00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,910
best practice or at least better

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,710
practices and as open toolkits and

00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:57,170
that's the the thing that we're doing

00:25:53,710 --> 00:26:01,100
twelve people would like me to answer

00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:05,710
what do I wish from Debian so I wish

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,710
that Debian live long and prosper and

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:15,350
because because really along with other

00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:17,870
large end of us right like the Mozilla

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,200
Foundation and Linux Foundation which I

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:23,600
just mentioned the Wikimedia Foundation

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,790
so you folks are the foundation upon

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,980
which that we're advocating to the

00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:30,980
representative democratic system that

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,720
hey there is some merit in this kind of

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,680
radical transparency in a kind of

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,260
radical participation and as a anarchist

00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,900
conservative anarchist Minister I have

00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:44,450
three conditions going in the cabinet

00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,280
the first is that I don't issue a

00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,670
command to anyone nor do I take a

00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,890
command everything is by voluntary

00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:54,170
association and this is straight from

00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:56,780
the Debian Constitution where by

00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:59,120
Constitution nobody can really be forced

00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:01,880
into doing any non voluntary work and

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,350
the second one is that I get to work

00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,150
anywhere on the planet

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:08,270
and it still counts as working so it's

00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:10,100
teleworking and it also enabled a lot of

00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,830
government apparatus when people

00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,230
discover that by a paper-based delivery

00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:17,630
they can't really reach me well they can

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,480
reach me after a week or so it is far

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:23,390
easier if you just use email and but the

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:27,940
the third thing also very important is

00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:31,250
that when I develop this voluntary

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,140
co-creation methodologies it is

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,240
important for me to be radically

00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,240
transparent and by radical transparency

00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,460
I mean not just meeting with lobbyists

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,520
and journalists are all published online

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,900
even internal meetings that I chair we

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,540
also publish everything

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:50,150
a transcript two weeks after every

00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,920
internal meeting and so so it looks like

00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:55,100
this is also using a free software

00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,520
system called state developed by I think

00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,830
my society in the UK so like when Debbie

00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,110
Plouffe speaking for uber at the time

00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:06,110
come to lobby and have a conversation

00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:08,270
not only is our discussion on the record

00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,790
is on 360 records that we can put on a

00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:14,030
VR cardboard or something and we live

00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:17,140
the conversation and every utterance has

00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:19,700
a permanence URLs that you can get full

00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:21,860
accountability of who said what where

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,690
and and this is important for the

00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,060
government service because the public

00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:28,610
servants in this situation they become

00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,400
very innovative the contrary to popular

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:34,070
belief because previously when something

00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,720
gets right and people like it

00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:38,150
the minister always takes all the credit

00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,250
and if something gets wrong it's always

00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,530
the career public servants who you know

00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,930
didn't execute well or something and

00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:47,420
this netizens has a way to to blame the

00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:49,280
people in charge for it so it in that

00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,650
situation there's no motivation for them

00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,230
to innovate but now with this radically

00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,850
transparent system not only is the civil

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:59,060
society more understanding of the

00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:01,490
context before making a decision but

00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,380
also all the credit gets shared to the

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,330
actual career public servants who

00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,490
propose something innovative in the

00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:09,100
first place and if anything goes wrong

00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,360
well because far as I know I'm the only

00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,610
ministry in the world doing this it's

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,040
all Audrey's fault so uh basically

00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,200
people I can absorb that plane while

00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,750
people share the credit so we get a lot

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,090
of very innovative ideas frankly from

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,980
the public service such as adopting a

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,770
thoroughly free software system called

00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,420
sandstorm IO for our entire public

00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,980
service and in all the different

00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,320
branches of government not just the

00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,020
demonstration and so basically we use

00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,720
only free software on this sandstorm IO

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,730
system Davros replaces straw box either

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,310
Calgary places Google spreadsheet either

00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,290
path replaces Google Doc we can replace

00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:47,150
this Trello and there's also rocket Chad

00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,800
and I'm sure you know the other tools

00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:51,440
that the free software people uses and

00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,390
basically we say any public servants as

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,120
long as they have a govt TWU email

00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:58,200
address can enjoy this for free and even

00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,840
develop new applications on it

00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,360
because cybersecurity hardened we asked

00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,970
our best white hat hackers to to attack

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,980
it and filed a few CVS so there were

00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,260
reasonably sure that is very secure now

00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,420
so that people can develop applications

00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,940
by themselves which is free software and

00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,950
like I don't know planning travels

00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,780
together ordering lunch boxes together

00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,340
and things like an unleash innovation

00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,530
within the government because they know

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,510
that this system can absorb the cyber

00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:28,470
security risk and I can absorb the

00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:30,120
political risk seventeen people would

00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,800
like now quote it's good that you

00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,540
discovered Debian and what makes it

00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,220
interesting at such a young age do you

00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:38,750
run Debian yourself have you contributed

00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:41,820
to Debian personally my desktop

00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:45,570
environment when I started learning I

00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,610
think it's around 1999 like system level

00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:52,290
programming I'm sorry has always been

00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:54,780
FreeBSD and so I've never actually I

00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:56,490
used the Debian compatibility layer I

00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:00,020
don't know whether that's that counselor

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:02,730
or not but I have always been a FreeBSD

00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:05,550
developer and contributed to also driver

00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:08,340
support in FreeBSD and also most of my

00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:10,860
contributions in the perl community and

00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,680
in open foundry here in Taiwan early

00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,050
2000s were first committed to the

00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,030
FreeBSD ports system so it's a different

00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:20,430
culture it's not copy laughs it's not

00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,470
copyright it's copy center you go to the

00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:26,010
copy center and make many copies and so

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:28,530
that's a very permissive community that

00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,770
that's my primary community the FreeBSD

00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:35,070
community but there's various efforts

00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:39,330
within Debian to reconcile with for

00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:42,600
example a mojo signing system I piloted

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,430
the module signing system in Sipan in

00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,800
the comprehensive pro archive network

00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:48,840
and so there's a lot of packaging issues

00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,310
and so on so I basically chime in from

00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,290
from here to there but I did not

00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:55,140
participate in the Debian

00:31:52,290 --> 00:32:00,030
democracy but I really admired from afar

00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:02,340
in the freebsd camp this time one has

00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:03,570
the open-source strategy yes and I'm

00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:08,360
glad you asked

00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:10,010
so it's called DIGI+ and

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,130
I don't know where how much of this is

00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:15,529
translated into English oh all of it

00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:18,799
okay it's good so if you go to smart

00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:21,490
that I want that govt ttw so we tend to

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,049
have one webpage for each major

00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:27,380
government policies so there's smart

00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:31,130
Taiwan govt TW there's AI Taiwan there's

00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:33,559
bio Taiwan there's also CIA Taiwan I

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:37,690
think that's not yet translated where

00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:40,909
the CI stands for civil I OC which is

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:42,679
shared open data and also open algorithm

00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:44,539
platform for all the different

00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:46,760
environmental data aggregated in a

00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:50,029
supercomputing Center that combines the

00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,370
people's like the guff CEO side of air

00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:54,409
sensors and also the government side of

00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:57,980
government sensors and so that we can

00:32:54,409 --> 00:33:00,950
all talk with the same fact-based or

00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,570
evidence-based policymaking process so I

00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:05,120
encourage you to check out smart Taiwan

00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:08,059
and also links to Asia Silicon Valley

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,519
and things like that and so when we talk

00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:13,010
about open society here and also about

00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:15,260
the education like interdisciplinary

00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:17,450
digital talents in the digital US plant

00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,519
we specifically set especially in a

00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:23,029
basic education level that is to say K

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,620
to 12 level but also because in the next

00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:26,600
five years all the college level

00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,639
students also need to learn computation

00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:33,159
of thinking programming half of it I

00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:36,230
think by the year like 2021 or something

00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:39,529
all of it needs to be a base on free

00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,570
software if the student graduates and

00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:43,519
joins the private sector and choose to

00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,990
use proprietary software that is their

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,269
choice and of course the government

00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,710
can't do much about it but while they're

00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:50,809
still children while they're still in

00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,899
the schools it is very important for us

00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:56,690
to not let as children or the students

00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:58,399
to be a subject to vendor login so that

00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,960
by the time they graduate maybe the

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,760
vendor has already moved somewhere else

00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,559
maybe the vendor lose interest in that

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,409
product line and we see a lot of that

00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:08,510
dynamic so at least in the education

00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:11,210
system were very firm that we prefer

00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,830
free software for education and when

00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,359
teaching computational thinking when

00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:17,230
teaching artificial intelligence when

00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:20,540
teaching all those different you know

00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,210
dg+ powers more machinery green energy

00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,760
technology

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,830
so on we prefer free software when it's

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,320
in the school and so in the digital US

00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:31,679
there is a strategy to erase awareness

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,909
and have talents in in school and

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:39,859
there's also TW OSS that I oh I think I

00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:43,520
hope I remember this right which is a

00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:46,200
again not yet translated in English oh

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,379
it's somewhat translate to English but

00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:52,379
in any case yes so what what this tries

00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:54,839
to do is basically by getting people

00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:57,149
sufficient education materials so people

00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:59,700
working on any level of education can

00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:01,859
point to existing communities introduce

00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,930
their students to such community and

00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:06,990
even people working in like sea level

00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:10,160
government or national level government

00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:12,630
can also point to the worth cases of

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,260
incorporating like Postgres sequel or

00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:19,260
like OpenStack or darker ecosystem and

00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,790
or tensorflow or whatever and and which

00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,280
is the success story and you're

00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:25,230
replacing proprietary systems because

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,730
it's not about procurement anymore we

00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:28,619
already change our procurement

00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,750
regulations and the government digital

00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,540
service principle all that people need

00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:36,330
now is a boost of confidence of rish

00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:39,089
basically by people who keep telling

00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:41,490
them it's ok to use free software and so

00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:43,530
this is the TW oh is this not IO and

00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,820
ever and if you find anything you know

00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,619
wrong with it or anything you can

00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:50,760
contribute please feel free to let us

00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:52,680
know in T wo SS what is tamas a

00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,140
restrictive on internet access captive

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,510
portals registers ID for item Wi-Fi

00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,540
access etc is there a reason bad

00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:02,910
experiences or not well the reason is

00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:06,510
usually cited as quote cybersecurity

00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:09,060
unquote but it is not a very strong

00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:11,490
reason we are actively looking actually

00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:14,430
like in the Taiwan high-speed rails to

00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:17,250
relax the captive portal because

00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:20,250
especially when you're on a high-speed

00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:22,260
moving train it is very difficult to

00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:24,720
actually resume from Hospital hotspots

00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,810
if you need to go through like five or

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,420
three screens to register so that's the

00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:33,240
first place where we will relax this

00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,010
captive portal thing and then once this

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,320
is

00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,510
done and piloted and proven that there

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,340
it really doesn't need to more

00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,810
you know cybersecurity cars that we can

00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,700
put out here cybersecurity cars

00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:45,800
elsewhere on the stack not necessary on

00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:49,840
the personal identification level then

00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:53,030
we will also relaxed like internal

00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,790
within the government agencies we often

00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,619
provide to wi-fi's one for employees of

00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,320
the government and one called ITA one

00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:03,290
also for visitors so the visitor Wi-Fi

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,470
we then will also look to relax more and

00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:08,270
that's because in those two venues in

00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:10,580
the high-speed rails and also in

00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:12,770
visitors to government agencies you

00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,130
already did your registration somewhere

00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,920
else

00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:18,800
we don't physically actually need you to

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,500
register again I'm less sure about the

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,630
city level public Wi-Fi like DP III or

00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,520
other state level Wi-Fi because they

00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:27,500
have a certain level of autonomy we

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,760
don't actually dictate what they do but

00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:34,760
we just pilot this relaxed login portal

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,800
thing and also establish corresponding

00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,410
sever security rules and maybe the state

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,520
level people will also get enlightened

00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:45,590
we'll see there's 11 people who want to

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,270
know is it possible to be citizens how I

00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,130
interact fully with the government

00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:51,380
without using any proprietary software

00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:54,440
and Clio asked because that's one of the

00:37:51,380 --> 00:38:00,740
cases that I'd like to show ok it used

00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:03,400
to be very very difficult so just last

00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:07,369
May actually there was a petition that

00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:11,619
talks explicitly about it and very

00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:14,390
explicit ok last May there was a

00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:16,640
petition or a National a petition system

00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,920
which after five thousand people

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,730
participate online you can use email or

00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,770
SMS it's not a real name basis but

00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,960
basically after five thousand people

00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:30,020
counter signed a petition the government

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,500
is up leaked to to respond to it and

00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:35,690
this petition is by this user experience

00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,990
designer Georgie rien which says that

00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:41,570
our next filing system is explosively

00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:44,660
hostile to use us so it's kind of

00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:46,880
negative energy in that petition there's

00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,510
more negative energy in the body which I

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,859
will spare

00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:53,750
the quote but basically at a time about

00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:56,570
80% of comments in that petition

00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:58,790
discussion area it's very negative it

00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,920
cost for the resign mminton Ministry of

00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:02,990
Finance it cause there's a lot of

00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,500
accusations to the vendors who provide

00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:09,010
the system and all because in Windows

00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:12,230
there is a proprietary windows-based

00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:14,330
application for tax filing but for Linux

00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,790
and for Mac and basically now in those

00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:20,020
systems there's a channel applet and

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:23,000
because last last year Oracle I&C

00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,100
deprecated Java applets the user

00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,600
experience become very very bad people

00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,820
will see that

00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,980
please wait it's still installing some

00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:33,890
applet components but because the pop-up

00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:35,750
is by default blocked right so nothing

00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:37,820
happens and after 40 minutes people are

00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:40,310
still waiting and so it really is very

00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,910
difficult to use and after the

00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,670
e-petition

00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:46,130
we basically there's a participation

00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,890
office a team in each ministry and each

00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:50,450
participation office are a POS is

00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:52,250
responsible just like media officer who

00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:54,560
talk to journalists or a parliamentary

00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:57,410
officer who talked to MPs pls

00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,740
talk to such emergent petitions and by

00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:03,320
basically saying I think not only very

00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,990
quick like 36 hours after this petition

00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,690
RPO an Ching hyung just posted publicly

00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:10,760
that everybody who complained about our

00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:13,609
tax file experience on non Windows

00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,040
systems is cordially invited to a

00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:18,470
co-creation workshop some Friday in the

00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,090
Ministry of Finance and this is very

00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:22,850
interesting because just by proposing

00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:25,700
this invitation previously like 80% of

00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,050
people were just flaming and 20% of

00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,119
people were saying well we're using

00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:31,640
Windows it works kind of okay but nobody

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,040
really took heed to them after this

00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,619
invitation is sent 80% of people started

00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,570
proposing useful suggestions useful

00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:41,390
recommendations and only less than 20%

00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:43,850
still remained trolling or flaming

00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:45,920
people but people don't pay attention to

00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:49,400
them anymore so basically what we did

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,900
was inviting the trolls and who turns

00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,910
out to be not harassed they were just

00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,010
fed up with this text banking system and

00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,990
they had to vent their feelings but

00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:59,450
after the event their feelings we all 10

00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:00,260
solicit ideas from them and people who

00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,150
can make it too

00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,310
I pay make it to Taipei otherwise people

00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:07,130
can still participate using

00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:09,740
live-streaming and one of the key thing

00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,780
here is radical transparency and also

00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,260
accountability meaning that people who

00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:17,300
say that it's you know the words are

00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:19,100
explosively crowded we just put that

00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,950
post it s where it's I explosive a

00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:24,320
crowded that it is so brilliantly

00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:27,170
written that people are confused and

00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:29,210
then we just post it and people say you

00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:31,370
know instead of designing a system makes

00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,710
people feel better people don't feel

00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:35,720
good at all when they think about filing

00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:37,310
taxes and so we should shorten the

00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,350
experience instead of trying to make

00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:41,590
people feel better and so on and so

00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:44,480
basically people who proposed such

00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:47,600
ideations online which is use service

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,640
design methodologies and hold five

00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,440
co-creation workshops with all the

00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,110
different stakeholders involving the tax

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,060
filing experience today this year the

00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:59,180
tax filing experience for non Windows

00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:02,660
systems is entirely html5 based is

00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:05,390
adheres to the open standards people can

00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:08,180
just using any platform that can run a

00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:11,090
browser to access the tax filing system

00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,580
so the short question - - short answer

00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:16,780
to this question is that it has become

00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:20,000
more and more possible while while we

00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:22,670
translate or transform existing desktop

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,170
oriented or Windows Pacific or Java

00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:29,420
applets into web-based situations now if

00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,060
you insist that all the JavaScript

00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:34,670
libraries and CSS libraries that

00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:37,070
government system use has also to be

00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:38,870
open source or free software that would

00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:41,510
take a little bit more time it will need

00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:43,520
the current generation of system to be

00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,230
wholly replaced by post coverage

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,450
government digital service principle

00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:49,580
post treaty SP systems but we are

00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,740
focusing on reducing the load on the

00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,510
client side first so at a time I think

00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:56,990
you can complete most of the

00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:59,600
interactions of the governmental issues

00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:01,550
like filing taxes and so on if you're

00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,200
okay with using a free software browser

00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:05,180
but there's still some proprietary

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,830
JavaScript code this kind of the

00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,190
compromise situation we're in at the

00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:09,680
moment

00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,660
but with the rollout of FG DSP were also

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,230
looking to make the JavaScript and CSS

00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:18,840
and also the Bagginses

00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:23,130
more non-proprietary Anonymous would

00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:25,440
like to know the shared objects in the

00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:30,119
text file in plugin it's not open source

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:33,690
why because the copyright belongs to I

00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:37,260
think the vendor Johar Telecom and back

00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:40,590
when we signed the agreement with Johan

00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:43,619
telecom the GDS P was not in effect and

00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:45,330
so the contract basically attributed the

00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:47,760
copyright to the vendor who only

00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:49,320
conferred usage right to the government

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,530
and the citizens this is a mistake that

00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:54,840
we will not repeat but at the moment we

00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:57,390
don't have the legal recourse for the

00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,380
current generation of plug-in systems to

00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,859
be relicensed

00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:04,290
as free software I tried but the easiest

00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:07,200
way is just for the next version of

00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:09,270
identification methods such as the

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,460
national healthcare card which by the

00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:14,430
way is currently in public consultation

00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,650
if you want to contribute like you

00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:21,119
demand free software stack for the

00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:24,180
entire for the entire Medicare system

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,180
please feel free to go to join govt TW

00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,310
where we are now asking for consultation

00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:32,369
on people who are looking to virtualize

00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:35,010
their Universal Medicare card and or and

00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:37,140
are are to use NFC based of thank

00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:39,510
education so we want to know about

00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:42,119
people's preference when it comes to the

00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,220
technology to the regulations as well as

00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:46,560
to the total cost of ownership and also

00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,960
of usage and so if you feel strongly

00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:52,140
about it please do contribute online

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,060
join platforms so that we can say to the

00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,440
people right in the contracts that

00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,840
people really feel that is very

00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,890
important for our next-generation

00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:03,480
authentication methods to be non

00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:05,250
proprietary so please write so it people

00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,230
would like to know what is your opinion

00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:11,550
on ecommerce application refusing to

00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:15,240
operating our restriction of 3/3 abrecan

00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:19,500
iDevices is affair well mostly I think

00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:22,700
they do this with the call to you know

00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:27,300
quote fraud prevention unquote

00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:30,480
it's it's not it's not about fairness I

00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:33,600
think it is about choice are the freedom

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,060
choice or the liberty of users the

00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,010
reason why GDS pre-pre first free

00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,470
software is because when it comes to

00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:43,320
healthcare or tax filing there really is

00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:44,820
no choice to be a citizen in Taiwan you

00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,160
have to go through some

00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,200
government-sponsored API endpoints to

00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,330
produce some you know government

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,160
sponsored form data and so on and

00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:55,590
because there is no choice

00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,560
we really need to be open so that people

00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:00,060
can hold us to account to be more

00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,090
transparent and also innovate on

00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,700
existing solutions but for e-commerce

00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:07,440
applications where there are no de facto

00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,500
monopolies when people still have a

00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,680
choice the government at the moment does

00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:17,100
not take a stance against the e-commerce

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:20,040
apps who uses you know fraud detection

00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:22,680
or prevention methods that results in

00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:25,530
incompatibility with rooted androids and

00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:28,530
Joe Burke and iDevices I think one of

00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:31,890
the possible Direction out of this

00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:33,660
dilemma is to basically talk to people

00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,870
who work on quote fraud prevention

00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:39,150
unquote and just like how we talked with

00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:42,090
the high speed rails and government

00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:44,640
agencies providing item and software and

00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:46,710
and sorry Wi-Fi for free we basically

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,260
said you can do your proper prevention

00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:51,690
or cybersecurity on another layer in

00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,880
this system and not in the particular

00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:56,430
layer of requiring a captive portal and

00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,610
the NAC address which is very easy to

00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:02,160
spoof anyway right so so I think just by

00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:05,270
talking to people like this or we talk

00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,590
to people who advocate copyright

00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:10,290
protection through blocking of the

00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:12,200
internet we say you know with ipv6 is

00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:14,840
getting more and more impossible and

00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,670
watermarking or real-time watermarking

00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:20,400
methodologies it infringes on the

00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:22,290
consumers or customers experiences less

00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,330
and it is actually a better solution

00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,430
overall than just banning entire

00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:28,680
websites and so on so people have

00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:32,190
legitimate interests there legitimist

00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:34,770
aches but as I said often we think of it

00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:36,630
as like a tug of war but in many

00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:38,820
different cases it is possible actually

00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:41,130
with some what we call social innovation

00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:43,500
a innovation that basically takes care

00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:45,870
of all the different sites of interest

00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,090
and leaves nobody worse off so I would

00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,630
encourage people to feel strongly about

00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:53,780
it

00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:56,790
to contact your local friendly ecommerce

00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:59,070
Association like leukemia Chania Conway

00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:01,200
and so on who doesn't have a forum to

00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:04,050
talk about things like this we use that

00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:06,600
forum to talk about fraud detection and

00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:09,060
Prevention of like people selling

00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,890
counterfeit goods on Facebook to pretty

00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:13,320
good effect so I would also encourage

00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:16,440
you to contact your local Association

00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:18,060
about it there is any legislator

00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,100
supporting free software in the

00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:23,550
government movement like public money

00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:26,910
Public Health from the e FF well in

00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:31,740
Taiwan when when you see this this

00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:34,710
government the GD s P we already say

00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:37,680
this right this is public code this is

00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:42,390
open data and this is open standards and

00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:46,020
also common api's and we used also a

00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:49,230
Linux Foundation project called OAS 3

00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:51,270
which was swagger to to state had all

00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,980
the different systems built as long as

00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,870
it has a mission to Mission component

00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:57,540
need to adhere to this mission to

00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:59,730
Mission open API specification and the

00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:02,190
reason why we put an equal amount of

00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:04,700
attention on the source code license

00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:07,170
versus the machine-to-machine

00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,300
integration is that if we only talk

00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:10,740
about public health or the license it is

00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,570
very often that a system integrator

00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:15,630
would deliver something there's this

00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:17,940
technically free software it depends on

00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:20,790
for example expensive Oracle systems or

00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:23,670
even more expensive db2 systems and

00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:26,040
things like that and and that basically

00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:28,260
still restricts the reuse across

00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,420
different ministries and agencies but by

00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,910
saying you know for all the import and

00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,410
export for all the patch level access by

00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:36,690
basically treating machine to machine

00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:38,760
accessibility the same way we treat a

00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:41,580
universal access like for blind people

00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,980
we basically say while you may still

00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:46,050
depend on oracle or db2 at a point the

00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,300
next vendor can just build on your api

00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,510
and even patch x

00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,970
sport what's in this public money page

00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:54,520
database and rebuild a service without

00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,570
depending on any proprietary

00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,060
technological stack so I would argue

00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:01,790
that the freedom of portability is as

00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:03,620
important as freedom to fork and freedom

00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:07,940
to reuse and both are of course very

00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:11,300
important and constitutional and not

00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:14,120
supposed to speculate on legislators but

00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:16,160
his various younger legislators in all

00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:19,250
the different parties who are also

00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:22,130
interested in this area is there any

00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:24,500
chance a people would like to know that

00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:27,320
I can urge teens of higher education

00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:30,200
facilities like NCT U to deploy IP

00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:32,900
version 6 well it's kind of a

00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,600
bootstrapping problem isn't at best this

00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:39,590
year we see a search of ipv6 adoption

00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:44,780
actually after Dominic changed hands and

00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:46,670
embrace a very ipv6 first roadmap we see

00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:49,190
for example Johan telecom has

00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:52,070
drastically increased the ipv6

00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:54,380
connectivity of their mobile clients and

00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:58,070
we see also see other telecoms and other

00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:00,350
appearing institutions in ISPs starting

00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:03,470
to adopt this trend and so once there's

00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:06,260
sufficient amount of people using the

00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:08,780
clients that are ipv6 enabled and even

00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:11,360
ipv6 preferred there will be sufficient

00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:14,630
pressure then for the service providers

00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:18,590
to provide as good if not better service

00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:22,910
over ipv6 and so I feel you're qqi help

00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:25,490
you your cue but but I think you right

00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:27,980
but but I think really it is up to the

00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:30,410
students and clients and the users that

00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:34,100
they internet the last mile providers to

00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:35,990
first build a useful and usable ipv6

00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:38,900
environment before we can then demand

00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:41,150
the service providers to to do so but we

00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,460
are seeing pretty good trends as of this

00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:45,770
year and so if you come back next year I

00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:49,210
think there will be sufficient demand

00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:51,860
from the users side to have the

00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:57,920
institutional internet service providers

00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:58,820
to provide ipv6 si so I'm technically

00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,310
yeah

00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:03,440
out of time so just take one last

00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:05,450
question what is my opinion of the

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,740
European Union earner of data protection

00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:11,810
regulation or the GDP are my opinion is

00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:15,410
that the GDP are is a much needed

00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:19,430
conversation that translates the idea of

00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:22,160
data from what people will confuse with

00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:24,440
assets intellectual properties which are

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:28,400
leaky abstractions that doesn't mean

00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:30,380
anything to a what we call data agency

00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,960
or a relationship based worldview

00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:35,210
basically as a government institution if

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,310
I hold your data this is a beginning of

00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:39,320
a relationship where you can ask what

00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:41,870
happens to the data who can update the

00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:44,300
data that reflects the purpose and if I

00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:46,670
try to use the data in any way other

00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:48,770
than pure statistics I need to check

00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:50,420
with view first so that you can you know

00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:52,550
know what's going on and provide the

00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,500
most up-to-date data instead of leaving

00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:56,690
you know just a shadow digital trail

00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:59,270
that's 5 years out of date that results

00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:01,750
in more bias and so I think data agency

00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:03,430
and data as a relationship and also data

00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:06,260
accountability accountability

00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:09,110
interestingly translate in meandering as

00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:11,780
three different words for people who ask

00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:14,330
for accountability is called Windsor for

00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:15,830
us who holds who are held accountable

00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:18,290
it's called downs we should be

00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,910
accountable and a system within it the

00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:22,490
holds both sides together the

00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:25,100
relationship is called code so Gigi or a

00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,960
accountability mechanism so when the

00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,450
Downs I encourage is a relational

00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,210
concept it is not a one-time transaction

00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:35,300
no concept and I think gdpr is a

00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:37,820
much-needed wake-up call for everybody

00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:40,250
to see data as a relationship and not as

00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:43,570
some digital asset or intellectual

00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,570
property so thank you very much

00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,210
