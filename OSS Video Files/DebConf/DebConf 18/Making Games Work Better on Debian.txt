Running games on Debian often means compromising the integrity of our
systems by dual-booting non-free operating systems or installing
non-free drivers on our Debian systems. This presentation will describe
some work sponsored by the Valve Corporation aimed at helping make
this situation better.

We're working on improving the free Mesa implementation of the
Vulkan API for AMD hardware, fixing support for Head Mounted Displays,
and improving X support for animated applications. All of this work is
(naturally) being done in the open within the context of the relevant
free software projects.
