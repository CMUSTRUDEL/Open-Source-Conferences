Many packaging tasks can be automated, and are likely to succeed without any human intervention:

 - creating a backport for Debian stable from a packaging in Debian testing
 - upgrading a package to a newer upstream version
 - packaging a simple Perl, Python or Ruby using one of the tools listed on AutomaticPackagingTools

However, doing those tasks still require Debian packaging knowledge.

As a step towards Debian's world domination, it would be great if we could automate those tasks and provide ready-to-use Debian packages, so that users are left with a deb-based alternative when there are no packages for their needs in Debian itself, instead of using upstream packages or building from source.

Autodeb is a project that tries to automatically create and distribute package updates and backports.

This talk will present the current status of the projects, statistics, and takeaways.
