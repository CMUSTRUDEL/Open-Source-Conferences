_di-netboot-assistant_ is a tool to simplify the preparation of files for TFTP net booting. It downloads and extracts the files needed and takes care of organizing them. In addition, it prepares a top level menu for PXElinux and grub-efi, which allows one to choose from all installed netboot images at boot time.

_di-netboot-assistant_ supports preseeding the installer in order to set up systems completely automatically. 

The talk shows how _di-netboot-assistant_ can be combined with _ansible-pull_ to install machines in one step from an ansible-playbook.
