00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:19,710
how can I have Debian as a programmer

00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:32,510
have fun so everyone thanks for watching

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm just sharing my screen here okay so

00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:40,410
the idea for this talk started with in

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,579
in Debian Brazil you're doing an online

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,859
event for the past month which one

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,809
online talk every night during the week

00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:54,629
and one of our colleagues does

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:58,729
traditional talk with title I'm not a

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:02,129
programmer how can I help Debian to help

00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:05,159
dismiss defy the notion that people need

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,560
to be hardcore hackers to help Debian

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,090
and then he he shows all the ways of

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,939
people who are not programmers can help

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:17,820
Debian and I'm I always wanted to do the

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,219
other side of the thought which is how

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,399
can program has helped them because most

00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:28,469
of the time we we only advertise

00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:30,780
packaging contributions for technical

00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,310
work and I think there are lots of

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,829
opportunities for people who are

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,750
interested in programming but not

00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:39,390
necessarily necessarily want to learn

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,350
packaging do everything that that that

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:49,259
that that involves so I'm beginning for

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:52,289
telling your Christmas story I as a

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,049
developer when I became acquainted of

00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:57,030
the notion of automated testing I

00:01:54,049 --> 00:02:00,299
couldn't do anything else I mean I can't

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:04,159
understand how people to in 2020 program

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,899
without having automated tests and

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,130
without the ability of knowing something

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:13,739
they do breaks and I just can't wrap my

00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:16,319
round my mind around it so I am really

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,680
obsessive testing and I taught myself

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,750
several different

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,209
framework on several different languages

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,670
and I army I'm always trying to write

00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:31,299
and maintain automated tests for my

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:34,120
projects I also like Debian lot it being

00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:40,329
a Debian contributor for 16 years now

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:42,220
and I think in last year I helped

00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:45,730
organize a Deb concern for the Chiba

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:52,170
where I live currently and there are

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:52,170
sprin eyes and I I'm always trying to

00:02:52,859 --> 00:03:05,739
align my interests with Debian and the

00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:10,049
automated testing area is one of the

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,049
areas that I try to do that a lot so I

00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:18,909
in back then some time ago I got to know

00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:22,840
the that some two called out of package

00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:25,180
tests existed and it's it has to go of

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,639
supporting automated testing of Debian

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,019
packages when they are installed in a

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:34,449
system so that you can test the package

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:38,440
when it's installing a system it really

00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:41,919
works it was started in in the contest

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,799
of a bumper in 2006 by Ian Jackson it

00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:54,699
was later made enemy marching feet and

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:58,440
in 2013 there was a there was a only 100

00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,440
packages supported out of package tests

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:06,909
and I was wondering I mean I I had known

00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:11,349
the two for a while and I I was waiting

00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:14,139
for someone to come up with with some

00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,760
service that ran out of package test

00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:18,880
from every package on the Debian archive

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,310
and that service that just didn't come

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,560
up okay I had this thought in my mouth

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,539
that in my mind that someone should do a

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,889
service to create a service to run out

00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:29,270
of package set against the Debian

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:33,170
archive and

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:38,420
I kept waiting for someone to do it and

00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:44,690
someone never did it so in the Christmas

00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:46,280
break of 2013 I I started doing some

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,820
experiments to see how difficult could

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:53,240
it be and see I thought definite net was

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:56,200
born you know it was a really simple

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,780
thing it was just a shell squid running

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,940
or all of the packages in a loop at the

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,220
time there was only 100 so it was fine

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,310
and then I quickly realized that that

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:12,110
that was not enough and then fast

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:15,100
forward to today we went from where

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:19,370
almost zero in this scale packages with

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:22,520
auto package steps support to 15,000

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:26,470
today we see that most packages fail

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:31,010
most as it's passed their tests and it's

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:33,200
really it's really nice to be involved

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,300
with something that's contributing to

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:41,390
including increase the quality of Debian

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:43,550
and then more recently the test results

00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,060
are being used to control the testing

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:49,360
migration so if something has a test

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,830
suite and that it's not working properly

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,980
we assume that that's a problem in the

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,450
package and it's now a regression so

00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,080
that the package doesn't migrate to

00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:02,210
testing this is she was mostly driven by

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,670
Pogue Evers so I want to thank him very

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:08,810
much because I didn't have the energy to

00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:10,490
pursue Portuguese and it's it's a very

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,600
nice addition to the demo release

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,600
process in my opinion

00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,580
so the de state of Devon CI today it's

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,790
well it's well maintained I mean I'm

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,920
still interested in able to support this

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:29,350
and have a lot of fun doing it

00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,000
there's lots of issues to be fixed and

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:35,120
improvements that could be made in all

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,950
parts of the platform so that includes

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,900
that CI itself which is the tool that

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,230
provides the interface and the

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,009
scheduling of the tests out of package -

00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,919
which is the

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:49,069
that runs tests vocally so you can use

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,499
all of those locally to develop tests

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:57,559
and then out of that page which is a

00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:59,479
tool to automate creating the tests

00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:03,710
which specification for common sets of

00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:06,409
packages so for instance Ruby packages

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,360
or para packages you don't have to write

00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:11,689
the same specification over and over

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,879
because those types of packets have a a

00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:15,409
common way of declaring the test suite

00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,800
so you don't have to do it over and over

00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:18,520
again

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,969
you can do it centrally in Auto diabetes

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,710
in currently the the bus factor which is

00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:27,259
the number of people that needs to be

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:30,409
hit by a bus for this to become non

00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:33,589
maintained is very low so for the city

00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:36,199
maintenance Ipoh and i just share the

00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:40,669
day they work load they're pretty nice

00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:42,770
so he does a lot of things he maintained

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,259
the season but for the cold part the bus

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:49,120
factor is one so if I got hit by a bus

00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:51,800
or if I lost interest or if something

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,430
happens to me and the code is pretty

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,439
much and unmounting so this is a problem

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,480
because I don't think people who

00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,800
volunteer that time for Debian should

00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:07,729
[Music]

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:10,370
become slaves or off that work and they

00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:12,649
should be able to step aside and new

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:17,240
people should be able to to come in and

00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:25,999
help bringing the dead part of debian

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:31,269
forward so now I'm going to do a very

00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:31,269
quick explanation of how debian works

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:37,599
Debian's is a distribution so it works

00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:40,399
by taking code from upstream and

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,919
integrating that code in a consistent

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,430
distribution and then provide that code

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:50,420
providing that depth of the to users via

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:52,490
packages and then getting fixed by

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,980
feedback from these those users in terms

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,770
of bugs in terms of patches and then

00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,910
triaging that and

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:03,100
what's what makes sense in the upstream

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,350
use case and what makes sense only in

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:12,790
Debian and then forwarding the ones that

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:19,270
make sense for upstream and Debian has a

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:22,990
pretty pretty impressive way of working

00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:26,080
with its different releases so we we all

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,230
know this we have an unstable release

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,820
testing religion the stable release and

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,700
testing becomes stable or every two

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,430
years and stuff migrates from unstable

00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:40,540
which is our testing playground to

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:44,110
testing every five to ten days with no

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:49,589
critical bugs and fulfilling some

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,589
quality critic criteria and then this is

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:59,380
and this process takes needs quite some

00:09:53,140 --> 00:10:02,020
automations work in terms of scale as of

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:06,670
this month I took these numbers of your

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:08,920
days ago Devon thinks the beginning of

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,959
the year so we're not even the middle of

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,690
the year yet on only five months at

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,670
Mumbai we already have more than a

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,430
thousand unique contribution

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,990
contributors and those people need to

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:24,279
communicate they didn't to coordinate

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:27,670
didn't collaborate and for that we need

00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:30,730
tools and services the side of the

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,910
Debian archives and increases with each

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:36,850
release by a lot and today we have more

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,529
than 30,000 source packages those

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,470
packages need to be maintained it should

00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:44,020
be improved need to be tested we have a

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,820
very large dependency tree and I have

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:51,579
some examples here for instance a very

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:54,540
simple package bash has at least five

00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:57,220
packages in in its dependency tree so if

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,140
there is a problem in any of those then

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:04,060
that problem could potentially affect

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:08,500
bash if you if you go to a less simple

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:10,570
package like asciidoctor if you can

00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,250
barely read I I'm sure

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,070
you guys over the string can't read this

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:20,700
I barely can read that in a 24 inch

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:20,700
screen and if you go further with it

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,340
pretty simple package but still less

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:30,550
simple than asciidoctor which is mutt

00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:33,250
then I practically can't can't read it

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:38,770
that on my screen so you see that

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:40,810
there's the size of the problem here so

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,270
there's a lot of ongoing work that needs

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,630
to be done to do for devan's we put

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:49,390
together those are all of those packets

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,620
and that huge dependency tree all of

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,090
those packages in there need to be

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,740
installable they need to build from

00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:57,580
source they need to receive security

00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,740
updates they don't they can they need

00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,860
should not have critical bugs they have

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,560
to be of an acceptable quality overall

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:10,030
and they have to fulfill several other

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:13,570
criteria and every time a package is

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,220
updated that can create problems in

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:19,360
different parts of the distribution so

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,800
see since our jobs to integrate the

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,540
different packages that came from

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,800
different upstream with sometimes

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:30,550
different objectives and different ways

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,550
of working we need to make them work

00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:37,000
together and it is just impossible for

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:39,460
people to do it by hand so that that's

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,120
why we need services and tools and then

00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,560
those services and tools need need a lot

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,340
of the same work that we need for

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,530
packages and some more so they didn't

00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,380
also need to be maintained then as to

00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:54,910
receive fixes to be improved to be

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,950
upgraded when there is a new diamond

00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:00,400
released and sometimes debian services

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,140
have parts that don't work with new

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,780
diamond release they need to be fixed in

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:10,840
between each people to do that work and

00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:14,650
now we're about to discuss how you can

00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,080
help I'm going to highlight a few

00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,740
projects based on on a call I sent an

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,410
email

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:24,460
I think week ago to Debian project with

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,560
asking people for feedback

00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,380
preparing this talk I wasn't even

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,930
planning on presenting that in Brazilian

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,510
eating the meaning that conch was mostly

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,780
preparing food for the the Debian

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,880
brothers you even bless next week but I

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:42,280
thought it was interesting and I could

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,360
get help some good feedback so I decided

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,980
to do it also on them in Def Con so I'm

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,010
going to present that list of projects

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,630
from from the feedback I got this is not

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,890
by any means a complete list so

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,780
everything else in Debian needs your

00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:02,560
help

00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:04,570
both on the on the technical part that

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,670
is faculty services to sports

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,180
everything is needs more people helping

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:12,670
and the non-technical part of publicity

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,200
community events translation and

00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,850
everything else that that needs to be

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,930
done that's not packaging or not not

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,880
related directly to should the to the

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,340
producing of the distribution but you

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,320
need it for us to work together and I'm

00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,700
using technical non-technical codes

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,930
because I don't really like that

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,340
distinction because for instance

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:36,220
publicity needs technical knowledge in

00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,510
the area of publicity and translation is

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,060
technical knowledge in the area of

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:45,790
translating so I'm not really a fan of

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:49,690
these of this differentiation but we

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:53,620
often use it so I'm yeah I use that as

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:55,810
well and the topic of programming is to

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,880
have happen to just be the focus of this

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:01,480
particular talk but I want to emphasize

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:04,560
that everything Lebanese helped and if

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:10,150
you want to have Debian you should do it

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:12,640
there's a hopefully full not full but

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,560
more complete list of Debian services on

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,530
that that are just that are our upload

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,960
these lights to to the wiki laters will

00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:22,570
no need to take notes or anything that

00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,910
the wiki page is a list of dead and

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:28,090
services is probably not not complete

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,940
but it lists a lot of services that are

00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:37,360
not mentioned here in probably also need

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:38,250
your help so how you can get started

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,500
first

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:45,810
step as if as if any free soft product

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,910
that requires development if you get up

00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,980
develop an instance running locally we

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,840
want to download this for us you want to

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,300
look for instruction on how to set up

00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,910
how which packages you need installed

00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,740
for its work and you need to make it run

00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,850
locally that's that's the the first

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,200
thing you need to do it is important to

00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,820
say that you don't have either need

00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,400
permission from anyone to read the

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,040
source to to run locally to study how it

00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,920
works and to try to fix bugs and

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,450
improvements and this is what free

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,610
software means you ill donate people's

00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,850
permission to to work on their stuff of

00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:23,430
course if if you are working on a larger

00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,860
change in you are going to touch a lot

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,750
of the code and change how things work

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,780
you want to discuss that first if the

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,430
people who maintain the project but

00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:37,050
usually for simple stuff you can just do

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:40,110
it and in the case of Debian if you need

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,940
help you can use the contact information

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,930
I'm going to provide for these projects

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:49,050
we are seen here or if you can also use

00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:52,440
the Debbie meters group if you can find

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:54,870
answers or oarfish if you are stuck

00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,350
somehow and you can find the contacts

00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,910
that the right contest to talk to so we

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,150
will hear there was a discussion in

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,819
Debian winters and Debian project some

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:09,150
time ago where we eight people agree

00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:11,699
that the vm meters could also be a

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,670
channel where people can ask questions

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,100
about working on Debian infrastructure

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:22,110
projects that's that's a good place to

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:24,480
go if everything else fails and one

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,880
thing to keep in mind that people are

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,170
busy and sometimes you won't get an

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:34,260
immediate answer and this is something

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,760
we have to emphasize to people who are

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,620
new to free software you have to be

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:45,350
patient because people have other stuff

00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:45,350
to do so now the list of projects

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:55,710
first is my shameless plug of my own

00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:58,950
project which is Devin CI it's a system

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,590
that runs the auto package - that's

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:05,340
sweet for every package in Devin that

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:08,100
has support for it it has a continue to

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,370
be updated since the beginning and there

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:13,590
are still things to do and it is now

00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,850
pretty important in the Devin release

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:21,659
process in me I think that's really nice

00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:26,640
this is the basic format of the dalish

00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:29,010
I'm presenting and I'm going to give

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,230
some pointers for people who want to

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:34,950
know more about the tools and want to

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:37,679
help Deb sky is a service but it's also

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,799
- you can install that Deb CI on your on

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,720
your machine and run the test in the

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,760
very same way that they are run on the

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,789
infrastructure so that's useful you can

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:52,470
also use it to set up the auto package

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:54,539
says back into to run tests against the

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,360
main programming languages used in it is

00:18:54,539 --> 00:19:00,450
our Ruby shell and we use also use chef

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,390
for configuration management of the

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:06,120
service deployment so what started with

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:10,470
a single VM running testing a loop it's

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:14,760
now almost more than 20 video machines

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:17,130
different cloud providers so it's just

00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,340
impossible to do that by hand the

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:23,039
services that I got event of net and the

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,690
source code isn't sauce you can contact

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:31,710
the team on the depsite channel or FTC

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:36,390
or via email to Devin - CI at least a

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:39,090
minute or another - that needs your help

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,780
is those three those is a dependency

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,490
analyzer

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:47,610
it's used by by QA team encouraging to

00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,980
analyze for instance which package are

00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:52,620
not available Stella going testing for

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:56,429
instance being installable is the basic

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,890
part three or four for them for

00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:00,930
packaging debian but it's also using the

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,420
beauty so every build doing by

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:06,390
in the beauties uses those to reach

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,970
calculate to build the penises in style

00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:13,940
in install just the package is needed

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:17,100
for for building the PEG package it's

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:22,530
it's a tool or you can use it locally

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:23,850
it's also service it's it uses Okemo

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,910
which is a functional programming

00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:30,090
language and lots of packages in this

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:34,080
area of calculating the penis isn't so

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:40,260
hard in the complete problems are within

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:43,380
functional languages for some reason the

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,960
upstream source code is that the get

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:52,050
live.com and the dev and QA services is

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:54,050
that its offs as well so the contact is

00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:57,900
Johannes shower

00:20:54,050 --> 00:21:05,250
that's his email and you can also find

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:07,710
him as George on IRC another tool also

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:12,630
that also handles the pain see graphs is

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:15,330
watch which most used by the Debian

00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:17,370
bootstrap team to cope the bootstrapping

00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,320
problem is interesting so when you when

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:22,380
you want to start a new diving part

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,900
which is butadiene for a different type

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,640
of computer than the ones we already

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,960
support you you have to start somewhere

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,710
so you have to bootstrap the system so

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:38,310
you need to use a different you usually

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:41,070
use a regular amd64 Intel based computer

00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:45,240
for instance to compile the package for

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:47,010
that new architecture and that's where

00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,880
bootstrapping comes in because you need

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:56,190
to know which parts of the data archive

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,780
can be compiled with a minimal set of

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,030
packages so that that's a very difficult

00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:05,790
problem there's people working on that

00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:08,790
and watch is also a okano to its source

00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:12,390
code is that in that URL there

00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:14,580
you can also talk to Josh on IRC so

00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:19,080
these are both of his

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:22,260
suggestions for the store another thing

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,450
that needs people's help is dev scripts

00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:27,000
so everyone who works with packaging

00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:30,330
knows Dell script it provides several

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,850
very useful tools for them and maintain

00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,850
errs and it it has a lot of work to do

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:45,779
it has like hundreds maybe of different

00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:47,789
tools and each one each of them has work

00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:50,809
to be done you can see there did the

00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:53,789
number of bugs open and it's it's purely

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:58,559
that's pretty there's a lot of work to

00:22:53,789 --> 00:23:00,510
be done so it's a tool so it's something

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,450
that you install on your system but

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:06,840
again it needs programming work to fix

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,389
the issues and to improve it's written

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,870
mostly shell Python Perl and pear is

00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:14,760
highlighted because the current discuss

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:17,429
meta analysis which is much higher in

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,500
solo his he said that he can really

00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:24,179
write there and he needs help with with

00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:27,330
people who can write a Perl code so the

00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:30,659
source code for it is on salsa Debian's

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:42,450
- del scripts and there's also dedicated

00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:45,750
IRC channel their scripts license check

00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:47,909
is also very useful - which is well I

00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:51,240
think license checker for source files

00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:55,350
so source files who we all know that

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,690
Devon cares deeply about license so you

00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,240
can see that it has less bugs in that

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:03,299
 but even then it's a decent enough

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,330
amount of work to be done there in

00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:11,039
anjaana's which is the the main

00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:13,019
maintainer of this - and he %

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,909
suggestions for people to look at the

00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:18,679
license check it's something that's

00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:18,679
useful for every devil maintains as well

00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,970
it's written Faro the source codes they

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:28,530
eat some salsa on that address again

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:34,500
I've shared this wise latest

00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:37,590
you need to take notes no the devil

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:40,950
keyring so this was sent to me too by

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:43,200
guna they also need help

00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,820
well the dammy krane is one of the most

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,650
important data sources for Debian

00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:51,600
because it is the author authoritative

00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:55,140
list of people who can upload package to

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,380
Devon and people can vote individuals

00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:01,410
and everything so everything that that

00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,340
has authentication based on GPG keys is

00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:09,720
managed by the Devon keyring team and

00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:11,640
they need help it's a pretty important

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,020
service for that millon programming

00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,490
language is not really clear to me I

00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:18,510
didn't have time to investigate more

00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:22,230
deeply but you have at least the website

00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:25,290
and the keyring itself where people can

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,970
help I know there is code there I just

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:30,990
didn't have the time to figure out which

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:34,250
language they are in so the deserve she

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:37,200
runs that keyring the TV not work and

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:41,250
the sausage king has a few posters there

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,960
where you can help so I'm listening

00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:48,990
owner hears contacting see he was the

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:51,210
one who reply to me then comes another

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:53,510
very useful services sources of Debian

00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,800
not work which is a service that

00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:59,880
publishes and lets you browse the entire

00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:08,340
source code of Debian so you can find

00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:13,250
the source code for any package in you

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:15,540
can use that for instance to to check

00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:20,100
stuffing the package source code without

00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:26,250
having to download everything it's

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:28,170
mostly within Python the links are we

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,810
have the service itself running sources

00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:33,660
of definite work the source code is

00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:37,880
under the QA team on salsa which sauce

00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:40,740
about a minute or - QA / step source and

00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:46,559
there is that short URL for the

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:49,890
piece of bugs on sources of divinorum

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,220
and they hang out on the devil is a

00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,220
channel

00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:05,090
contributors dr. bailet org is a very

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:09,900
important also for for debian it's it

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:11,940
it's where I got the number of twelve

00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:15,270
hundred and nineteen people contributed

00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:21,120
ebony in this year so it keeps track of

00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:23,190
people contributing to Debian and it has

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,780
different data sources so it tries to

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:29,520
list people who not necessarily work

00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,110
with package because in packages you

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,020
have the maintainer field you have the

00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:35,610
uploaders field that you know the people

00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,250
who are doing that work but for other

00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:41,220
stuff is more difficult so this service

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:45,740
has to go on the dedicated data sources

00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,740
and in lists people who contribute their

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:51,809
eat ourselves written in Python so as I

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:55,350
said it runs on contributors the tag not

00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:58,320
org the source code is on salsa under

00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:00,660
the new maintainer Jim and they also

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:05,190
have a dedicated pseudo package owner

00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:07,800
devil BTS for folks and you can find the

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:12,809
team on the dev a new main channel on

00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:15,210
IRC security team is very important

00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:18,809
right we all want to get security

00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:20,040
updates for our stable machines and the

00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:21,440
work of the Scourge team is very

00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,830
important

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,590
they are currently needing people with

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:33,090
Python knowledge to help with security

00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:34,710
specific features in DAC which is means

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,470
the America is key to it which is the

00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:40,230
main the tattoo that manages the Debbie

00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:43,020
archive in aus with the daemon security

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:46,230
tracker so if you want to contribute of

00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:48,410
Python then you can talk to the security

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,410
team

00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:01,139
another thing you might notice when you

00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:05,730
are browsing packages in Debian is the

00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:08,340
tags that I get added to the to the

00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:11,039
packaged metadata people who do

00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,769
packaging know that that data doesn't

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,559
come from the source code of the package

00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:20,009
it comes from somewhere else and that

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,870
somewhere else is Deb tags which is

00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:26,879
establish that let people core about

00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:29,279
collaboratively provide categorization

00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:32,850
for Debian packages so you go there in

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:39,419
the red tags and those show up in the

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:41,009
Debian archive it's a service mostly we

00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,870
clean Python there's quite a bit of

00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:46,230
JavaScript as well for the the tag

00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:48,720
editor the the service runs on depth X

00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:53,370
dot type in dot work the source code is

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:56,519
at salsa as well and the contact is in

00:29:53,370 --> 00:30:00,299
iko iko maintains a lot of of services

00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:04,049
and it does a lot of important work in

00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:11,129
lebanon he should be really nice if

00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:14,399
people could help him with this another

00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:17,730
thing that needs help the daemon wiki so

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:22,559
my mine which is the the software that

00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:24,659
runs the Debian wiki nice 2.0 blissful

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,690
happens all the current maintenance of

00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:30,090
the Debian weak he needed to be released

00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:33,210
so they of course need help with

00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:36,090
programming and it's mostly also Python

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:41,279
projects then you can talk to upstream

00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:42,750
on mine wiki slash morning and you

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,850
cannot see it running on wicked op

00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,809
developed world so you eat it would be

00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:48,299
nicely there are more people

00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:51,799
contributing to it upstream and helping

00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,799
to make this release happen

00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:58,350
the name demo new maintenance website is

00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:02,790
also a project that needs help it

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:05,880
manages everything that people need to

00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:08,490
as in relationship they're dead my

00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,140
membership so people who are applying to

00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:15,870
be Devon developers they need to go

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:20,340
through this people who need to check

00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:23,570
who who are the Devon developers so this

00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:27,960
is the this source for that information

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:31,320
it's also Python project so the service

00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:34,620
runs on an MDOT Devon not all the source

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,840
code is also on salsa and there's also a

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,060
dedicated pseudo package on the BTS

00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,790
called a name the definite org for bugs

00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:46,400
against it and you can contact the team

00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:49,980
at the Devon new main channel on IRC

00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:53,010
there's also SSO which is the Devon

00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:55,890
single sign-on services it's a little

00:31:53,010 --> 00:32:00,120
more legacy code at this point because a

00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:03,240
lot is deprecated and we want to move

00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,040
away from that to logging logging in

00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,960
with salsa logins but there are still

00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,660
some services that use the certificates

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,150
generated by it so it YouTube's useful

00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,610
for instance to drop the alert support

00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,950
which is not working anymore because

00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,830
reload itself doesn't work but it would

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:23,370
be nice to add salsa log in here a lot

00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:25,350
of people to choose their stars account

00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:29,450
to get a certificate for the services

00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:32,520
that you use this SSL Certificates

00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:35,670
it's again a Python project the source

00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,430
code is that South as well there is a

00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:41,700
dedicated team freight called them SSL -

00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:43,740
team and the contract unfortune is just

00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,180
any rico as well i made some

00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,430
contribution to it at some point ago

00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:51,590
some time ago it's it's a very

00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:54,270
interesting project and also finally

00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:57,150
last but not least we have the debian

00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:58,920
package tracker which every package

00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,380
maintainer knows it's a source of very

00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,380
useful information about packages in

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,480
debian and also its loss it can also be

00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,710
very useful for users try to figure out

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:14,520
which package they want to use or not

00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:15,990
it's a service that's mostly written by

00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:20,010
- as well

00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:24,780
it runs on tracker Debian of our source

00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:27,240
code is on salsa also they have there is

00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:30,179
a very nice contribution guide so with

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:34,760
instructions on how you can run an

00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:37,980
instance locally and everything so it's

00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:41,160
there's very good information there and

00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,850
the the people who maintain it can also

00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,960
be contacted

00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:53,070
Devon QA IRC channel or in the demo

00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:54,600
mailing list to conclude Debian is one

00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:59,130
of the largest free software project

00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,990
that exists in the world it's I like to

00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:05,309
call it an infinite construction toy set

00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:09,540
there is nothing a shortage of things to

00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:13,470
do if you are interested but it is your

00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:17,730
help so the I try to show how big that

00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:20,510
mean is and how difficult it is to keep

00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,889
that working by hand we need tools and

00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:25,770
we need people to help with those tools

00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,840
as a as I mentioned I want to mention

00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:29,850
again there are several other services

00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,359
and tools that I didn't mention here but

00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:35,070
also need contributions so that page on

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,879
the debian we he can be a nice reference

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:41,580
for people interested contribute to

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:45,119
Devon do not make you learn a lot of

00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:51,389
stuff but you also be a nice addition to

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:53,369
your professional career so if Devon

00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:57,660
participate in a few outreach programs

00:34:53,369 --> 00:35:00,900
that can provide paid internships or on

00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:03,240
Debian and if you are eligible please

00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,010
consider applying so we have Summer of

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,640
Code for university students

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:10,410
it works for in the garage but but also

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,170
works for master and PhD students

00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:16,020
it runs during the summer of the

00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,550
northern hemisphere so if if you're

00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,609
interested you have to get in touch with

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:22,350
the projects before that like the first

00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:25,470
half of the year the first quarter

00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:28,830
quarter of the year and there's also

00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:29,910
Trichy which is a program to include

00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:33,480
people who are you

00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:36,510
under represented in in free software so

00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,059
it applies to women season trends trans

00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:42,569
men genderqueer people and anyone else

00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:45,720
who faces systematic discrimination in

00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:47,819
the tech industry in E it's a little

00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,400
more inclusive because it runs in both

00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:52,849
summers not not only the one in the

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,849
northern hemisphere

00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,380
that's it

00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:01,890
I want to thank pronounced Moritz much

00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:04,200
here Johannes Jonas bow gunner Stefani

00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:06,450
Enrico who provided some boots for this

00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,480
top would put spot put sock together and

00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:11,690
those are my contacts and thank you for

00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,690
watching

00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:22,819
maybe a plaintiff s not sure home how

00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:27,329
much time we have that's right

00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:29,519
try to for work them you want to

00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:32,190
subtract the co way to set up a

00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:35,880
development instance without having to

00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:41,599
install it testing on my daily drive

00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:44,279
what do I need to use obviou oh yeah I

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:48,359
cannot give a general answer for

00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:50,519
everything but I can say that usually a

00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,170
VMs the easiest way especially for if

00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:57,059
you're not that running Debian already

00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:59,490
but for instance for that CI I develop

00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:01,440
it myself running the IBM sip so it's

00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:04,049
it's always working on debian seed so

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,880
you don't be sure and we deployed to

00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:08,480
that mix table so that it's also tested

00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:13,049
there so if you're running some Debian

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:15,839
newer than stable should work for in

00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:19,319
general I would say that especially if

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,960
you are a newcomer to Devon not very

00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:32,450
true it's usually better to study for

00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:36,750
the end isn't salsa is all happening yes

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:42,059
yes so the issue if SSO is that it's

00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:43,410
provided SSL Certificates that can be

00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:48,029
used to authenticate for instance

00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:50,430
tracker and some a few other deficit I

00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:53,250
itself uses certificates I want to add

00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:56,190
soft support but there are some services

00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:58,380
that need those certificates and if you

00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,000
are not a Devon developer you don't have

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,829
an easy way to get those certificates

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,819
because the ally of authentication is

00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:09,029
broken so in the mean time between all

00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:10,680
projects move to saw actual salsa for SS

00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:13,970
owed and which you need

00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:16,500
SSO dot they will not work to work and

00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:18,539
for people who are not Debian developers

00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,220
we need some other authentication means

00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:22,220
other needles to get the city

00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:42,830
have you wet Michael Snapple barks pause

00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:54,020
for 2009 on leaving Debian yes that's is

00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:57,050
the question that is that it I mean yes

00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,790
so that Debian is not only the one of

00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:00,620
the largest but also one of the oldest

00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:03,860
streets of the products that exist so

00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:05,810
it's been around since 1983 that's out

00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:09,860
of baggage so some parts of the

00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:12,410
infrastructure look outdated but they

00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,850
are there for a reason and people in

00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:16,430
Devon usually don't like trying stuff

00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:23,630
out just because they don't look modern

00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:25,010
enough I think and I think we need more

00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:31,130
people helping to make the

00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:33,610
infrastructure better and more more

00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:39,020
efficient in today's technology

00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:41,510
landscape but there are just some things

00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:46,190
that's in a perfect size of Debian just

00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:47,990
take time to chubbies it I mean we are

00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,970
not battery we have soft so we have

00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:53,510
several other stuff several other things

00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:55,340
that people hold and we nee about some

00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:57,740
time ago and and I think we are moving

00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,780
in in a nice direction I think just it

00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:08,410
just take time because because that

00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:11,480
means big we are out of time okay

00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:15,550
thank you everyone yeah thank you for a

00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,550
