so hello and indeed goodbye

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,190
I'm putting together some slides they're

00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,450
not very long a fancy but we can have a

00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,950
go through them and then if someone

00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:24,220
still wants to say something after that

00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:27,579
you can do sir so first of all thank you

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:31,239
to everyone and with everyone I mean

00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:34,380
everyone is was possible firstly thanks

00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,730
to our mini Def Con online stuff is I

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,620
think this is the fullest net if a

00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,410
decrepit humble way the seems a fairly

00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,500
high voltage a big Jonah's under steve-o

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,330
- you know and like it's an anybody if I

00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,270
miss someone out very sorry already to

00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:52,090
the slides that you know also thank you

00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,170
to speakers without them obviously none

00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,440
of this could have happened

00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:59,920
biogeography or not antonio crystal

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,750
frontier paul been myself and delivery

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,640
just finished talking a few moments to

00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:08,830
go also thank you to you who have been

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,940
watching and participating without you

00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:15,640
all out if it would be kind of pointless

00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,350
in our sea I think we had just over a

00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:23,470
hundred and fifteen people participating

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,600
according to our CDN logs it seems like

00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,940
at least two hundred and eighty one

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,820
people have watched to at least 20

00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,130
minutes consecutively so I guess it was

00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,220
close to 300 people in total that have

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:38,500
watched our streams and then also thank

00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,330
you to our sponsors even though we

00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,970
didn't have particularly sponsors for

00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,170
this mini dead current we used

00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,940
infrastructure that we paired it with

00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,040
usual that kind of money that does come

00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,890
from our usual DEP Debian and Deb Khan's

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,590
money so thank you to you all our usual

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,600
sponsors and maybe in the future when we

00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,490
figured out a whole stack which I think

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,740
we will get pretty close to after this

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,180
mini Def Con frontline there now it

00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,770
would be nice to get some sponsors as

00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,600
well even if it's just for something

00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,030
loose things that we might want to buy

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,189
like t-shirts or maybe we could do

00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,430
things like having a sprint in the

00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:14,049
morning like a something worldwide where

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,909
people get together once we can do that

00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,200
and then in the morning people in

00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:17,730
different cities can get together to

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,040
hacking

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,110
morning and then we have stalks trimming

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,090
everywhere in the afternoon where we get

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,739
some pizza and here or something so

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,030
there's some ideas I think we could play

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,030
with that that's nice

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,580
I know it's an upwards yeah we did learn

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,470
a lot this weekend we got lots of

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,620
feedback we figure than a lot of things

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,470
out the stack we used this weekend was

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,150
very Minimum Viable Product

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,180
we want to get something that works it

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,069
works reliably it wasn't very fancy but

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,799
for the most part it did get the job

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:52,620
done and the biggest problems we had was

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:55,049
when people had where for Internet

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,989
connections or power cuts it seems like

00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:00,329
metal Oh strike swing it does the most

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:03,859
damage but that's how things go and

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,859
that's it for the slides

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,580
and penalty speechless

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,430
[Laughter]

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,290
I guess thank you to everybody thanks

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,890
for attending thanks for bearing with us

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:27,410
