and next out is by John Philip it's

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,330
about the Debian community team it will

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:21,870
the United Nations organizations of

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:24,060
Debian Android okay thank you very much

00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:29,150
thank you very much for the introduction

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:33,989
and for your work you did okay I did so

00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:37,499
well hi again there Forks so yeah today

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:43,039
I I want you to talk about the community

00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:46,309
team from a funny perspective also in

00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:50,609
typical introduction but also a funny

00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:53,839
perspective - yeah let's let's see

00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,760
together interesting comparison I think

00:00:53,839 --> 00:01:00,839
in the talk I did about the Emma front

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,389
said before there's a bridge someone

00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:05,100
asks about a flat organization and I

00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:07,710
explained that it was very difficult

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,520
according to me my opinion to do is a

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,290
flat organization even if Debian has

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,719
success with with this kind of

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,560
organization that is not easy at all

00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:22,799
I also remember that the Jonathan when

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,189
introduced is a application for to

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,189
become DPL introduced with some

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,990
political considerations about the

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:35,579
importance of deal in the current world

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:40,950
and so I told myself but Wow let's do a

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:43,680
comparison between well Debian and and

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,990
maybe the real world actually I'm the

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,920
role of the of the community team in

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:53,390
this in this environment well in in the

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,670
real life we have we are all individuals

00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,350
we are individuals and when we do

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,020
something which is not good we have the

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,670
police we have the law we have the judge

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:09,360
and we have estates Estates is a

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:13,560
regulation a regulation mechanism of all

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,739
we we do individuals and when there is a

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,250
problem individuals go to to to referee

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,520
a kind of referee to to

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,950
to solve the situation and to fix things

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:30,660
but States themselves they have nothing

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:33,980
about so the relationship who exists

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:37,020
which exists between them are a

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,300
relationship with strength a

00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,920
relationship with there are some wears

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,510
them some discussed there are some

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:52,260
balances some states are every states is

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:55,980
is central at least from a point of view

00:02:52,260 --> 00:03:02,000
from a right point of view what's the

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:07,170
relationship what she saying is well

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,590
anyone in Debian is States because no

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:13,040
one has an obligation no one can request

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,290
you to do something and tell you you

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,140
absolutely have to do and if you do not

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,000
you have a problem now you do or you

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,080
talk to the Constitution is clear about

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,610
that saying that any developer should do

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,739
something but if it isn't what it

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:33,720
doesn't do so we have seen this this

00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:37,440
this world where everybody is with

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,320
principle everybody is free and in this

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,940
context a deviant contributor in

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,820
particular they will develop early be

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,600
element changes may be compared to two

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:52,260
states because are completely free and

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,769
of course because they are free there is

00:03:52,260 --> 00:04:01,860
a easy comparison we can do saying that

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:07,620
well how to discuss states discuss with

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:10,860
the trade with the diplomacy with with

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,780
that between us of course we discuss

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,730
just like human beings because we are

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,040
individuals so we discussed we are

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,400
mailing lists etc but of course there

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,959
are some formal problems sometimes some

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,560
some situations which are not

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:31,620
comfortable and so what do the what did

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,410
states because they

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,919
well aware that the way to discuss

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,190
together was very not acceptable because

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:45,000
there was somewhere some difficult worse

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:46,229
world well in 1945 it created the United

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,410
Nations Organization

00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:53,400
it's a place which was designed to talk

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:56,510
about were not problem together to meet

00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:01,710
each other a kind of mediation place

00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:03,630
well let's not don't talk about the

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,000
results of this organization because a

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,340
lot of things could be done and we would

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,430
go so far in this talk it's not the

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,020
topic but well the purpose of this

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,630
organization was a play to talk together

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,600
to meet each other and in a kind of

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,419
mediation place maybe on we have the

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,770
community team so community team whose

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:28,020
role should be somebody in saying well

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,449
let's talk together let's meet each

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:35,220
other when there are problems and let's

00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:38,250
mediate the problems so what do in this

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:46,010
context as a kind of united state

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:50,130
organization what do the community team

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:53,370
the first essential task of the

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:59,880
community team is to help Debian being

00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:02,220
welcoming so the first thing importance

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:07,139
of course to do that is to respond to

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:10,199
concerns well some contributor in Debian

00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:12,990
has a concern with someone or with the

00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,729
team because is not compatible with the

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,639
communication or with things which

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:19,770
happen in the team or in in his

00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,289
relationship with someone they can

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,289
contact us if you feel bad in the team

00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:26,789
if you feel alone if you feel there was

00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:30,630
a problem between two teams

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:33,210
well let's stir together and we're going

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,280
to try to find solutions to establish

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,130
together the dialogue between the teams

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:42,419
and to helping people to talk each other

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:45,270
to talk with calm and to try to do to

00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:50,400
find a way to proceed

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:55,370
together to go for well together it's a

00:06:50,400 --> 00:07:01,110
good I I did that Vivian should be

00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:03,770
welcoming community the other thing we

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,870
do is helping communication channel

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:11,790
managers when they need to take decision

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:14,070
about someone's behavior well when you

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,650
run at least master when you manually

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,660
manage the mailing list or the planets

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,440
I mean structure only when you you you

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:25,080
you answer the Bugzilla order etc

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,950
sometimes they ask for messages which

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:32,550
may be difficult which may be

00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:34,440
unacceptable for most reasons we may be

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,760
a problem for some persons in the

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:41,910
community and of course these

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,010
administrators may need to take a

00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:47,160
decision and to take the appropriate

00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:52,140
action but made to be supported in that

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:56,820
with an external point of view and it's

00:07:52,140 --> 00:08:01,470
important so also we have this this this

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:03,730
role also in the depth conf itself you

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,819
know that there is a code of conduct in

00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,819
[Music]

00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:14,400
the code of conduct well he is also

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,470
applied to all the Debian project but

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,180
he's particularly right in the dead code

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:26,010
and you know that this code of conduct

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:29,010
also we need someone to let to judge but

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,470
to take advice to say well in our honest

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,690
opinion we think you drop's

00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,660
are you are not compliance with a code

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:41,070
of conduct and so when we're doing that

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:46,050
we are not here to say you're wrong but

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:48,360
how could you try to find a way to first

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,800
be compliant with a code of conduct

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,120
because it's adopted by coastal

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,850
community but also to feel good in the

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,529
project and in the work environments

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:02,339
that these deviants

00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:05,220
society is Davian so to do that how

00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:08,249
could you do how could we could you do

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:12,720
so our role here here is giving advice

00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:15,930
of course and giving opinion to support

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:21,089
individuals to talk each other and to

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:24,870
talk together the other thing is / -

00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:27,540
importance and well fortunately it's not

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,670
the majority objectivity but of course

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,430
its way happen especially the last

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:36,449
year's is to help teams when the

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:41,430
situation becomes critical I mean when

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:43,800
there is harassment from someone the

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,800
original name of the team was an tyrants

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,170
month because it was created in this

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,439
context but now it's not exactly the

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:56,300
same context but the reality is that

00:09:52,439 --> 00:10:01,589
harassment still exists or may exist and

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:04,319
it's important here to be able to give

00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:07,529
advice about code of conduct and its

00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:11,689
relations to coordinate the efforts

00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:16,740
which are done by the community by the

00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:20,839
communication waste managers by the DM I

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:23,220
couldn't manager by all the persons who

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,399
helped they began to to be a welcoming

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:32,370
community and to accept persons who want

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:35,129
to help but who also have a high feeling

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:38,189
about respect of others so it's very

00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:42,029
important from us also to be able to

00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:44,720
help all the tips and DPL itself to

00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:51,389
manage these situations and to manage

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:54,839
how we do thing also in this context

00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:59,249
it's important for example to be the

00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,579
destination of the behavior which make

00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:04,819
you worries Allah meaning least or

00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:08,129
beyond for example some day we had

00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:11,230
someone who told us that in the bug

00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:13,930
report in in a package or in

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:18,370
Saida churros who will sign it signing

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:20,350
over person it was worried about what

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,030
there was inside them we should take an

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,280
action to take some decision

00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:28,930
well we study the thing and we try to

00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:33,460
give an appropriate and square so it's a

00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:36,790
very important role but a real which is

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:40,150
not of course now has we we are going to

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:42,160
to see while I can say that just now we

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,130
have a delegation from the game

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,360
developer Livia millimeter sorry the end

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:52,260
the DPL so the delegation actually just

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,420
shows all that and shows all our

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:58,590
responsibilities but in a rare opinion

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:01,080
these responsibilities need to be

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:04,810
responsibilities to make easier the

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:07,330
dialogue between people one thing is

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,490
sure she will never be because Debian

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:13,270
doesn't work like that it will never be

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:15,820
a responsibility of taking a decision we

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:22,720
only advise others teams to take

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:26,080
decisions well I wonder whether it would

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:32,620
be useful to to to expose here all of

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:35,260
the members of the team well what I can

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,630
say just now uselessly because names of

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,490
persons you will have them on the

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:43,930
delegation texts and there was a wiki

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:47,350
page what I can say is that there are

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:50,560
several people today in the team it's

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:54,580
not very much we need person to help

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,000
these efforts people who want to to to

00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:01,120
do some you accept to do some mediation

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,030
will have the ability to to be to become

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,490
in front of conflictual situations and

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,740
the harmful situations are really

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,600
welcomed because we need that as it's a

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:16,900
very intensive psychologically this

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,330
world of being in this team so we need

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,300
help and the most we are the less

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:25,089
difficult is because everyone can take a

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:28,029
topic according to is available time

00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:32,229
and it's very much much more easy to

00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:34,419
talk together of a topic and to have

00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:36,599
someone and not to be in the situation

00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:41,169
where you say if I don't do something

00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:46,619
the fire is here so when we are seven

00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:49,599
it's a good thing but I think in the

00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:54,879
historical members of the team consider

00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:58,299
that we should be more luminous to be

00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:00,879
more comfortable and also in the

00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:03,759
delegation you will see that the DPL

00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,529
sinks and his rights that recruiting is

00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,819
very important because it's a very

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:12,429
difficult task that we we have anyway

00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:16,989
one thing is interesting is that this

00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:18,939
team has inside a high level of

00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:21,279
diversity I would say even if it's not

00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:24,129
perfect even if we'd like to do better

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:27,459
but there is a high level of diversity

00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:31,359
to sum up there was at least one blind

00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:35,279
people myself there are two women I

00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:38,769
don't remember the word to express the

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:43,689
gender but there is also a person with

00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:47,699
no gender so we'd like to be low numbers

00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:51,849
to increase the diversity of the team

00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:52,839
however I cannot say also that in my

00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:58,869
honest opinion

00:14:52,839 --> 00:15:02,109
we also up this diversity or at least we

00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:04,779
started having this diversity and that's

00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:07,689
the reason for which we didn't think

00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:10,059
that it would be in our responsibilities

00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:12,939
but it's a constant purpose with

00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:13,899
reaching and keeping the diversity for a

00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:17,049
simple reason

00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:20,019
also because maintaining diversity

00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:24,909
enables us to understand better the

00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:28,899
kilchers I take an example I am sure

00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:32,079
that a French or a European person will

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:35,289
not understand a conflict the same way

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,410
as person in Asia for example China or

00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:42,449
India so it's important to have this

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:46,709
the diversity of points of view to have

00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:49,569
global solutions about how we could

00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:53,949
consider a problem how we can consider a

00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:56,199
situation and first how we should

00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:58,660
understand a situation between two

00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:01,089
persons of a different culture and how

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:05,319
we should set it according to that but

00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:07,329
also with a mix of the cultural of

00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:09,029
everyone in the team so it would be very

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:16,660
important

00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:17,379
well how we work now so far I could say

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,920
never

00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:25,269
nearly that I nearly could say that the

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:28,449
members of the team are actually the

00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:31,420
security conceal of the National United

00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:32,529
United National Nations organisation but

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,629
the difference is that there is not any

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:39,569
privileges of course because the context

00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:39,569
is not the same but it's the same thing

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:54,600
when someone submits some concerns to

00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:57,100
the community at deviant dot-org

00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:02,079
community as Debian dot-org

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:07,020
yes he has a reply which is done

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:10,179
acknowledge at least in the 24 horrors

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:16,270
at least to love that someone read the

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:20,890
main and it's similar processes the case

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:23,890
are registered privately of course and

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:27,490
there are tracks remotely - to keep a

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:29,289
shark in a cave and to be sure that we

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,289
don't forget anything and we have a

00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:34,000
follow-up or what happens and all

00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:38,500
situations especially when the

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:45,100
situation's needs to to to be monitored

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:48,159
observe in the time be aware that any

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:51,850
proposal we do any advice with you or

00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:56,470
any action we advise to to take in

00:17:51,850 --> 00:18:01,150
is discussed in the team the team has

00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:05,920
weekly meeting so during these meetings

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:10,410
we of course talked about the week but

00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:14,530
the week evens and if there is some case

00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:45,700
arise we we discuss about it and we this

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:52,000
case about the reply sorry so it's it's

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:54,250
not to say that we we work with salsa

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,560
with work with a pad we work with with

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,320
IRC the sign yalla of course when we

00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:03,490
need to talk about to talk together with

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:05,950
speaking so we have the means to discuss

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:09,460
all what we advise all what we propose

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:13,590
and to be sure that the decision is

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,590
taken with all the diversity of the team

00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:22,630
when there is a concern about a

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:28,960
relationship between two persons or with

00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:33,310
another team etc well both parties are

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:36,100
littles unanimously of course we never

00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,630
say well the person told us is there is

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,770
a problem here what do you think about

00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:43,810
it though we see someone did and we are

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,720
not here to say which wrong with right

00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:47,260
but to understand what's your why did

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,960
you dance

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:54,270
what's your you how you consider that

00:19:49,960 --> 00:20:00,070
and what should be done with the problem

00:19:54,270 --> 00:20:03,460
well so we listen to every part of a

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:11,230
situation to be sure that

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:13,240
well advise who takes account or the

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:20,560
complexity of the human relationships

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:29,650
and team organization as well if now I

00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:32,770
talk about the coordination tasks if you

00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:36,340
like - yes I will with the RSC question

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:41,320
at the end of the of the talk so I'm not

00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:45,790
hesitate to ask again if I doctor if I

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:47,470
don't answer us immediately don't

00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,720
hesitate to ask again at the end of the

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,700
talk I will read it and I receive later

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,980
yeah

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,690
[Music]

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,320
the other part of the tasks just like I

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:02,740
said it's a coordination task the

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:11,200
coordination task implies that we have a

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:14,890
common common work space other teams

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,040
just like I mentioned so the AF DPL

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,840
under communication channels managers so

00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,690
that we took together and we take

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,350
appropriate action we have a follow-up

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:30,040
we are designing thanks to you to the

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:32,890
effort of one contributor many thanks to

00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:37,840
to do that anyway a guideline documents

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:40,300
to be able to face the future situation

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,550
more easily so which I think it would be

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,340
to say well when there is for example

00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:48,610
the harvest months what should we do to

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:51,340
avoid it becomes absolutely terrible for

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:54,820
prisons and and - really really

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:58,360
complicated so we have also that common

00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:01,270
place a guideline so a way to work

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,330
together which is defined also with

00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:08,740
other teams it's the same for the depth

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:12,480
off where we talk with deaf community so

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:16,429
they come from team of course a local

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,499
organization we are aware that they are

00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:23,799
something to improve about that we have

00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:30,559
some feedbacks about former things and

00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:35,379
so in this context we want to improve

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:39,379
our discussed with other teams and to

00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:42,460
make either as well the DPL work about

00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:46,399
all these parts of coordinating the

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:50,869
potential decisions taken by the DEP off

00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:54,340
local local teams etc so here again it's

00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:58,009
important for us to get involved in this

00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:03,279
way to make relationship either between

00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:06,900
building persons so I think all that

00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,409
enables me to share the idea with you

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,269
[Music]

00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:14,379
relative to be to disagree but I would

00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:18,169
be very interested to just know that

00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:20,230
Damien is a the community team sorry in

00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:24,169
account of United Nations Organization

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:28,279
because well the Debian is a society

00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:31,820
with persons with difficulties to talk

00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:35,029
together sometimes because some times

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,460
the debates is very very inflamed so of

00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:39,769
course we will be tempted you to be to

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,809
be to be enthusiastic but somewhat we

00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:44,799
don't use correct form and also more as

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:47,720
we are mains it becomes very difficult

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,509
so the community team is here to do

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:55,450
mediation to maintain in damien a

00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:58,610
welcoming community just like lighting

00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,860
un o is here to do the word security and

00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,809
the word peace even if they don't do

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,960
that very well because it's there are

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:09,139
other problems but well and we do that

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:13,730
via dialogue PR recommendations we had

00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:16,700
advice and there are other teams do

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:21,860
actions but also they are supported by

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:24,289
the common default so my purpose is

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,869
always the same protecting our members

00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:30,659
to make them pleased with contributing

00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:35,129
to Delia we are not a lot of deviant

00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:39,809
so it's absolutely Capitol essential to

00:24:35,129 --> 00:24:42,389
to be sure that together we get respects

00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:45,570
to ensure freedom of words of the

00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:52,980
diversity and to be sure that there will

00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:58,080
be a real happy pleasure for people to

00:24:52,980 --> 00:25:01,379
be in Endymion we have some some example

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,970
so I will not give of course on those so

00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:06,840
the exact examples because you

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:12,779
understand its enemies but just for

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:15,240
example to to to say a situation here's

00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:19,619
the situation ethics example someone say

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:22,159
I'm not respected by someone well let's

00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:25,649
try we try to understand why the person

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:29,610
wrote that what the person feels that

00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:32,369
then what wanted want means the person

00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:35,580
while shrooms and we discover that

00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:37,919
actually it's just that both teams have

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:41,340
some problems to discuss together and

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:46,320
the house some programs would absolutely

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:49,740
not a kind of concern and at finally I

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,049
think the person feels less alone feels

00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,110
well know is not your problem

00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:57,869
or at least you are not the target of

00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:02,190
what is said against what you're doing

00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:05,480
but the situation here is that there is

00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:10,559
a process problems but such that's all a

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:13,649
world is also to have this outside point

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,820
of view who enables the person to feel

00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:22,230
listened to by someone and to be to be

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:25,649
somewhat less stressful I hope so it was

00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:28,049
just very interesting where we tried to

00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:30,960
understand both positions and we we were

00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:33,629
higher especially to make two people

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,039
speak while it was probably difficult to

00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:39,659
do in in the first time optionally of

00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:43,549
course we try to find balance between

00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:46,159
both positions but the final I think

00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:47,809
we can without so much problems find

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,519
some solutions to make people talk

00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:52,489
together because in Debian we are

00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:56,330
everything to each other I don't think

00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:59,179
there is some animosity beginning we

00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:03,679
also help lift master as you know some

00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:06,110
members of the team members of the

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:12,379
moderation team for the project meaning

00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:16,330
list we also made some some some package

00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:21,950
removed for some some low maintenance

00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:24,859
because it was maintained anymore we

00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:28,519
also follow some hiring bug reports

00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:29,899
threads to count debates to try to make

00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,029
people understood that what they are

00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:40,609
saying that they are doing may be

00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:43,399
stressed food for persons so well in

00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:45,830
this context we try also to make people

00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:48,499
to understand that when they are writing

00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:51,529
something they should be aware about how

00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:54,679
it will be written read by the destiny

00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:59,330
of this nation so it's also important

00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:02,899
for us to want to do that as well - - to

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:06,590
be in this role of mediation to finish I

00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:09,019
would send you how to contact even if I

00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,269
started doing that community adds

00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:11,659
develop that Park is the best place to

00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:14,450
do that

00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:17,539
you also can contact the DPL under

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:21,109
probably will get together with depends

00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:23,480
some solution about the topic and also

00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:26,029
to this address you can apply to become

00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,399
a member of the team we really need out

00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:33,080
it's absolutely essential just like I

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:35,299
said some some times ago well thank you

00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,649
very much that's it for me and I'm

00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:41,480
waiting for your questions that I'm

00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:44,269
going to read now on the IRC your time

00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,149
and also don't hesitate to tell me if

00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:50,659
you think that my comparison with the

00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:55,190
international world is not good by being

00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:57,080
shitty maybe it isn't but it seems to me

00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,030
that it was funny to try

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,590
during that together and to have these

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,990
thoughts inside the community because

00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:06,200
there are some parallel situations well

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,760
which are very interesting attic thank

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,170
you and I've been waiting for you for

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:17,960
your questions that I'm going to read on

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:25,180
the channel we have some time because I

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:25,180
find what 15 15 minutes if I remember so

00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:40,700
well so it seems that feedbacks about 15

00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:48,020
minutes okay about about the Federation

00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:50,090
super the dead Federation make you miss

00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:52,280
a trip question before please to be sure

00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:58,490
that it's a question for the talk

00:29:52,280 --> 00:30:02,350
because I need to read it to the video

00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:04,730
to stay on to stay relevant

00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:09,130
why did you choose United Nations

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:12,110
organizations like a mellow g4 the

00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:15,290
libyan community team when its purpose

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:18,080
is to make daily a welcoming place and

00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:22,460
you know is a reference place to some

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,460
countries and interests is not a state

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,520
as yeah you write the comparison of

00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,860
course is it's an imitation of course

00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:36,170
because the history is not the same

00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:37,910
because we we don't of course we don't

00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,160
have the same relationship between us

00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,580
with the wireless states between two

00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,160
together

00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:46,400
of course so it's not exactly the same

00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:50,060
thing but at least let's focus on the

00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:52,670
the big ideas when you see you and oh

00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:55,550
was founded to constitute this place

00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:58,580
even if of course your rights there is a

00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:00,860
significant space of some some strengths

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:04,190
reports those strengths relations so

00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:06,890
yeah of course it's it's difficult it's

00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:09,710
not the same thing but at least in the

00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,390
ideal I thought it was interesting to

00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,850
this to

00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:16,630
by reason and I hope the gun is better

00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:19,650
than United States I am sure that pinion

00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:23,050
is much better but said well we also

00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:30,910
manage some relationship between us but

00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:36,850
also between the states it's not exactly

00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:40,120
the same but exactly we just talk about

00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:42,310
technical thing Indian states talk about

00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,700
a lot of things so it's not exactly the

00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:48,630
same thing but the way of working the

00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:53,740
way of things or at least they should be

00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:58,120
so efficient place of this organization

00:31:53,740 --> 00:32:04,900
is that is to make peace via mediation

00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:07,210
and yeah to evolve West alone we know 60

00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:10,240
decades later that is not efficient

00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:12,670
because it was not absolutely not simple

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,440
because of the Security Council we have

00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:17,320
permanent members who have some

00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,890
hierarchy okay there is not that Libyan

00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:23,830
so in Debian I think we have this

00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:27,460
capability to get a community team which

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:30,780
really helps us success that's the

00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:36,310
United Nations doesn't have due to this

00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:39,040
hierarchy problems so well it's the

00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:45,850
comparison of Cruz has limitations but

00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:49,150
it's it racing for the plan I think is a

00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:55,180
request other questions other other

00:32:49,150 --> 00:33:02,110
questions or me I saw some questions

00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:04,320
while I was speaking but I didn't come

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,320
back

00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:15,960
okay another question I don't know if

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:20,190
your parallel fits okay I see debian

00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,410
more as a peer review organization City

00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,510
TV so there's a technical community

00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:27,530
committee is kind of a proxy for

00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:31,130
technical dispute David community team

00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:35,660
might be more attractive for social

00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:41,610
disputes yes all right it's exactly that

00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:45,390
your rights saying that si T te as the

00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:50,190
technical role the community team hub

00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:52,440
has you right because saying that you

00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:57,000
were saying that both organizations

00:33:52,440 --> 00:34:00,419
could represent the UN own that I tried

00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:06,750
to compare and the right to say that

00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:07,470
there are two two parts of your computer

00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,429
right

00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:19,200
yeah and that's right see I shouldn't

00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:21,899
forget this other parts are there other

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:29,879
questions we have ten minutes so we can

00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:34,770
still together so I try to read another

00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:38,820
erection so honestly is is it's a story

00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:45,030
of analogy that importance okay so it's

00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:46,440
it's reaction about energy I'm watching

00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:50,159
state for the questions because I think

00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,600
it would be interesting also to to say

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,720
that all the Debian project

00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,230
yeah the videos may be aware of the

00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,500
existence of the team and hide it behind

00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:05,730
the delegation or the other team and

00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:08,930
also so it's important for me to be sure

00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:11,700
that that all the questions are answered

00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:15,750
in the video so that's the reason for

00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:18,750
which I wait somewhat before

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:27,470
saying goodbye there are some additional

00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:28,680
questions 20 still some 1 or 2 minutes

00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:32,010
anyway

00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,230
don't hesitate again to contact me

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:39,840
incubate so in quite creamy again of

00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:43,980
Cruz and I remember yeah I don't think

00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:46,650
maybe is to remember earlier question

00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:50,540
please say more about team member

00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:55,320
training well you're right

00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:57,450
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu asked that the process

00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,630
to become a member of our team is not so

00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:05,220
difficult because we don't have talked

00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:10,530
about curriculum vitae detail or things

00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:14,970
like that however we try to have people

00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:20,930
inside who like mediation we like the

00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:27,540
team working and who share for example

00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:31,320
for example set the tests to see how the

00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:34,080
person would write the mail in reply to

00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,290
a request and what will be his approach

00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:41,160
so we try to establish that's how a

00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:46,770
person would behave against a difficult

00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:48,840
situation once that is done and once

00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:51,390
that person is trained about the truth

00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,760
we don't have specific training about it

00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,610
because we remember that capabilities so

00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,780
we do with our sensitivity we do with

00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:03,120
our personal training but I think that

00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,010
persons will absolutely don't want to

00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,370
manage conflict and to manage difficult

00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:11,970
human situations anyway will not come in

00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:13,830
this team persons wanting to do that our

00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:18,060
presence we have a sensitivity about

00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:19,970
that and so we we needn't yes we should

00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,530
need irani but it's not absolutely

00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:24,300
dramatic gives every not a specific

00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,580
training and also because all the

00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:30,230
decisions are taken inside the team

00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:32,450
there are also the role

00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,710
[Music]

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:37,610
well there are people who have more

00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,990
experience in the team so we are your

00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:43,050
only I'm very young in the team I have

00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:45,080
some mods go in the team so I rely on

00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:49,170
persons having more experience and

00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:51,360
that's also the way to Train to see from

00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,660
other people with more experience what

00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:57,630
has the problems what hazards a thing

00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:02,220
how this happened etc etc and it's very

00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:05,580
helpful it's very very helpful too it's

00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:09,090
a kind of training what training is it

00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:12,480
in doing or planning to do yeah it's

00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:17,190
what I just said so not training ready

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,990
but when we end coming such team you

00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:22,830
first listen to persons having

00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:25,920
experience and well you progressively

00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:28,650
finish finding the good approach the

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,540
good reply and you you you take the

00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,850
Sirians you get involved in collective

00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:36,420
decision and after that you finish

00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:38,640
having experienced enough to to get

00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:43,170
involved more more more active and more

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:46,950
influence I'm liking the last message

00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:50,730
but the topic I've been tempted to say

00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:53,430
I'd love to join the team Wow but I know

00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:56,910
the time requirements to do the way over

00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:59,790
what I can offer well the time is not so

00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:02,400
important if we are a lot of person if

00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,200
you are a lot of person we don't spend

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,840
so much time to handle the problems

00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:10,110
because we do that we were a team and

00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,420
also there are several persons we can

00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:15,420
also let a problem aside because some

00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,640
what other roles so if we are a lot of

00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,670
people the work will be less difficult

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,310
but the least we are the most the work

00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:26,880
with the work is hard so even if you

00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:30,870
have a few time come if you have just

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:35,550
some one horror awake or sometimes think

00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:39,770
like that it's a good thing so really

00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:39,770
don't not hesitate anyway

00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,950
yeah Steve says that we there was a

00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,890
fault but organizing some more formal

00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:53,190
training for team members I don't know

00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,810
about that I maybe we are going to do

00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,140
that it could be a good idea I have no

00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,140
idea

00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:07,770
another question I wonder how you deal

00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:11,250
with words that might be read as

00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:15,000
aggressive ones it might not have been

00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:17,340
written that way well it's it's good

00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,680
case per case of course to handle that

00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:22,260
but it's a kind of a mediation to try to

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,130
make understand that for example to say

00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:29,280
the person well the also want it means

00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:31,590
this you understood that but maybe

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,140
because you are inside the situation why

00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:37,380
when you have a look and it's a look at

00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:40,470
it from an outside point of view we

00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,900
don't have the same perception and the

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:46,080
simple fact that the perception is

00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:50,240
different may help persons would take a

00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:54,090
Menor sentence just like an attack to

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:57,510
step down say okay maybe it's because

00:40:54,090 --> 00:41:01,680
I'm subjective we are neutral and this

00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:05,160
neutrality enables us to for example to

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,820
help people - well I understand your

00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:13,590
point of view but try to do to public

00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:16,980
attitudes with lemon cow more without

00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:19,620
being so much inside your topic and many

00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:22,550
you will understand that behind her the

00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:25,290
writing there is not a bad intention and

00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:26,880
if there is a bad intention it's another

00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,590
kind of problem it's a variation of the

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,440
code of conduct and of course it will be

00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:35,900
another kind of message but it's this

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,900
kind of action that we're trying to have

00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:45,090
three minutes but I think it's good for

00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:48,210
us I don't see further questions and I

00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:52,750
will not have the time so don't forget

00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:56,319
community dot at Debian dot org

00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:59,920
it would be really really great to have

00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:03,160
members as I say of course it's need it

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,400
requires some time but not so much and

00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:10,420
as I said if we are members we will have

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,460
to get less time for this job

00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,740
for your information in my personal life

00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:18,190
I also work massively for the

00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:21,990
translation in Debian and I have success

00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:25,510
doing that so the community team is not

00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:27,430
differently part of the time older

00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:33,880
members the other thing endymion because

00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:36,069
we love to only of course we only do

00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,260
this team we do all the things in Libya

00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:42,510
so it's also show that the time exists

00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:47,950
yes always I shouldn't go to faith yes

00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:48,569
of this compiler civitate the unlock

00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:52,089
ratafia

00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:54,400
ability yes I finished average ability

00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:56,849
is to be a Debian developer you start at

00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,819
the end developer you can get involved

00:42:56,849 --> 00:43:03,190
well just now it's finished so I am

00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:05,680
going to stop here if you have questions

00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:08,770
you can ask privately of course on the

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,349

00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:18,029
attention and don't hesitate to to do
