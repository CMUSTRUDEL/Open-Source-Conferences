	00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:20,110
so next talk will be by Delap organizing

00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:28,399
their beyond faced appear to be R

00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:31,669
facilitation training so can folks hear

00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:35,239
me I'm looking to IRC for responses

00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:40,600
because I will not have any sound from

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,600
jitsi so just let me know is this ready

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:50,720
good so I will start my talk if you

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,320
noticing my screencast I have an org

00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,020
mode file up just to let you know that

00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,750
no I have not made slides I'm just

00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,320
publishing my raw notes such as they are

00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:11,090
for today that's what we get out of a

00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:14,180
short lead time on my talk right so here

00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,760
we go and again I apologize I would not

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,740
attempt to read all these notes they're

00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,770
probably too small for you on your

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,510
screen but if they're recorded if you

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,880
want to look at them late later I'm

00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,400
exposing my typos for your benefit so

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:33,530
you can see more about what I'm saying

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,690
if that's helpful I wanted to introduce

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:41,740
myself a little differently this time

00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:46,400
and this is starting with Deb Kampf 14

00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:52,060
when I was available for the content

00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:54,470
team and the global deaf global team

00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,840
when they were needing help on agenda

00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,179
setting for a meeting that was looking

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,729
like it was going to be very difficult

00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:04,009
we met over lunch I made suggestions

00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:06,860
about how to generically set up good

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:09,050
agendas the next day I attended the

00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,770
meeting from the back and didn't really

00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,850
participate or have my name on anything

00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,470
but it went really well and I was

00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,500
surprised they actually used just the

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:21,620
generic template I suggested based on

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,500
that and conversations after I ended up

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:29,510
being invited for a keynote talk in

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:32,140
Montreal on the topic of when do social

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:36,230
issues matter in technical debates and

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:40,330
when they don't matter and there I had

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:44,810
technical issues with with a obsolete

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:47,540
laptop I was trying to use and so the

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,940
recording has a lot of stuttering in it

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,370
in terms of my presentation but the

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,640
content is good and you might be able to

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,410
find that if you're interested and the

00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,230
reason I'm talking

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,140
about those talks because all along I've

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,150
been thinking about Debian as a

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,060
community learning how to communicate

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,700
better inside itself because from my

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,730
point of view it's the starship example

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,040
of what democratic discourse can do and

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,940
the rest of the world needs these

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,880
examples

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,490
so while Debian struggles with its own

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,630
issues and publicizes those issues

00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,990
through completely open threads and on

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:34,600
many levels meanwhile this is an

00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:37,240
important conflict it's an important

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,250
conflict resolution process that the

00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,740
community is going through for itself

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,320
and what it learns is helping others so

00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,540
this has been my ongoing thought of how

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,210
I can continue to help Debian with this

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,400
process so today's talk is a

00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:59,650
continuation that I was hoping to bring

00:03:51,400 --> 00:04:01,540
up more at Debian 18 Taiwan when that

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,410
was my intention for Deb camp actually

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,060
and I ended up getting sucked into food

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,640
issues that needed to be covered because

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,560
they were translation and in my case

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,690
important food issues so I ended up

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,760
doing food team things which felt like a

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:20,590
gender problem honestly and I was angry

00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,090
and resentful because I really had this

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,760
other communications work that I was

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,980
wanting to work on so that was two years

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,270
ago you know I'm just wanting that

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,820
people know that this is something I've

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,960
been thinking about so today I want to

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:38,130
talk about the possibility of Debian

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,130
perpetuating its own internal

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,790
communications training among its own

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,070
membership and it doesn't need to be

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,240
just Debian internal it could be

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,900
sistering with other you know outside

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,790
free and open-source software

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,560
communities who are also dealing with

00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,640
online communications and training each

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,850
other so it doesn't have to be just

00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,230
internal to Debian but I want it to be

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,060
Debian folks to really have an

00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,520
investment in and be able to do it and

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,680
some of the examples that I'm drawing

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:14,300
from are from community development

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:17,870
of various sorts just an anecdote I was

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,930
looking for notes on such a group that I

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,910
had set up for a cohousing community

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,220
back roughly two thousand five or six

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,020
and then I look back at my notes this

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,580
week I saw that I had told them that

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,550
they should learn from the software

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:36,110
developers about issue tracking and that

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:41,930
kind of thing so that's those are my

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:45,710
introductions let's see here I want to

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:48,590
talk about I'm going to jump around a

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:51,699
little bit from my original outline here

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,080
I was also going to mention that I was

00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:58,400
available for the anti-harassment team

00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,020
in Taiwan and that's just background

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,180
just to let you know that I have gotten

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,680
involved with a few issues and and seen

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,300
what's going on from the inside in a

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,960
number of ways as I've been paying

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:11,990
attention to Debian since 2003 something

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,639
that came up when I was hearing the

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:22,030
sessions the last day or two is when

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,030
hearing about the communications team I

00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:27,740
am looking at I receive no they don't

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,389
need me when thinking about the

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,990
community new communications team which

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:37,010
used to be the anti-harassment team I'm

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:39,530
seeing that that team will need to

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,169
become more formal and meanwhile while

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,539
issues become while Debian becomes more

00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:46,639
important the issues become more central

00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:50,599
stage more legal issues become more

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,639
crucial to the overall reputation and

00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,949
I'm going to see that I believe I'm

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,110
going to see that community's team get

00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:00,289
more and more push towards a regulatory

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:03,470
role and by suggesting that there be

00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:06,380
more peer driven communications training

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:09,440
within Debian that's not from a judicial

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:13,070
you know decision-making policy setting

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:17,510
group about what is and is not okay have

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:20,180
most of that nuts and bolts kind of work

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,640
happening to help prevent those issues

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,510
from coming up to that kind of level

00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,020
where you end up

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,460
meeting something equivalent to policy

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,560
technical policy decisions being made on

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,240
the communications policy end because

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,960
that will that is coming up that is

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,110
needed but the rank-and-file need to be

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:45,410
able to self facilitate an example I

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:48,260
have for that is a story from another

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:52,070
community that I believe developers

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,600
should be aware of and it's large and it

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:58,220
has a lot of literature and that's

00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:03,700
helpful and that is the secular use of

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:07,340
Quaker consensus decision-making models

00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:10,040
so I'm calling it secular kook consensus

00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:13,390
secular Quaker because it's not from the

00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:16,070
Society of Friends necessarily and their

00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:20,870
spiritual communing that they do through

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:24,800
you know egalitarian speaking from

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:28,430
inspiration this is more about a nuts

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,550
and bolts how to run consensus meetings

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,740
and do policy setting and do governance

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,510
of important organizations and large

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,479
organizations through this kind of

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:42,169
formal consensus you know they called a

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,270
number of different things meanwhile

00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:47,840
within that community there's this idea

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:49,910
- called facilitating from the back

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:55,910
benches and facilitating from the back

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:59,570
benches refers to someone or who is not

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,090
up front doing something that in Debian

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:05,990
is usually called moderating it's not

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:09,590
somebody moderating up front it's one or

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,590
more people in the audience or from

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,820
their cervical who are asking questions

00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:19,660
and making comments that in fact

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,660
facilitate the group and

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:48,149
you know they didn't even need it and

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,519
what I had to tell them was no you

00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:52,529
actually didn't do the facilitating

00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,649
because you weren't yeah this is like a

00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:58,440
trial run for the training and I said

00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,480
actually they saw that you weren't doing

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,800
the steps that needed to be done so they

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,019
were doing it from the back benches

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,940
people were asking the questions making

00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,820
the comments and making the suggestions

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,800
that everyone kind of sort of knew were

00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,839
legitimate things for a facilitator to

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,950
say to keep the conversation going so

00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:19,560
this is the kind of mass movement that

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,660
I'm envisioning that Debian developers

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,100
could help engender within their own

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:31,410
communities it won't be everybody

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:34,829
computer technicians often a personality

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:37,200
trait prefer the clear straightforward

00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:39,180
or at least problem solvable

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,290
communications you get from a computer

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,850
and do not appreciate the thousands of

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,949
different factors that need to be taken

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,399
into account at once when you're dealing

00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:52,019
with real people it's dealing with real

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,019
people as much more complex than a

00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,149
computer so there will be people who are

00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,579
good at that and they're not always very

00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:02,690
active in Debian nail and might be in

00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:05,279
the future so what I'm talking about is

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:08,610
bringing those folks in Debian who are

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,510
known for being better communicators and

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,779
respected and appreciated and able to

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:17,730
pass things on at least by example

00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:22,769
bringing them into circles of learners

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:27,300
who are then passing that on oh here we

00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:34,010
go so the concepts of facilitating from

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:37,140
the back benches let's see opening my

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:43,380
horrendously huge org-mode file here my

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:44,760
apologies okay so here are some examples

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:49,890
that I've written that you won't try to

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:53,750
read I hope of ways in which a group can

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,750
be made self-perpetuating

00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:58,189
so for example so let's say you start

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:00,050
with a small group it's an affinity

00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:01,699
group style meaning that these are

00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,759
people who have some affinity for each

00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:06,860
other they can work with each other it's

00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,540
voluntary it doesn't have to be

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,889
voluntary but I'm picturing something

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,990
that's voluntary because that will make

00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:13,990
a lot of the hurdles easier to deal with

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,910
and for Debian it wouldn't make sense to

00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:22,339
be not no wonder actually wait a second

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,370
I'm gonna back up voluntary is important

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:27,350
because it allows the participants to

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,829
support the group and know that each

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,249
other are all trying to be helping each

00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:33,800
other

00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:36,499
if you force someone to go through such

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,379
a training yes you can force their

00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:42,379
presence but you can't force their will

00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:45,410
to be nice I think to help each other

00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:48,319
learn and get through this so in the

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:52,519
easiest ideal situation I'm suggesting

00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:55,160
everyone be voluntary people come in

00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,050
with if they're all getting to if it's

00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,579
rolling admission it might be different

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,559
but let's say you're all starting at

00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,990
once then you're going to do a one-month

00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,360
once a week so you're going to do a four

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,490
session training and you're all starting

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,949
in the first week so I'm suggesting

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:14,990
people could come in with their original

00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:18,410
stated concerns or interests such as I

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:21,350
have harassment concerns or I have

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:23,449
moderating skill concerns or I'm

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,579
wondering what are best practices in

00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:28,250
issue tracking communications that kind

00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:32,029
of thing so those interests are what

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:34,819
guide that participants study and also

00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:38,929
our guide that participants future

00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:40,490
contributions to the group trainers may

00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:42,620
might you might bring in an outside

00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,429
trainer I would suggest first starting

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,329
with people who are considered good at

00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:50,540
communications training inside the

00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:55,550
community but the trainers role is to

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,679
set up each to hear those participants

00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,620
mention their interests and their

00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,439
concerns and point them to resources

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,389
that they can study on their own so it's

00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:07,400
a little bit of mentoring or tutoring to

00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:13,280
help those folks

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:15,200
their own goals also if everyone

00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,330
starting at the same time then that

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,610
first session could include scheduling

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,920
future dates so the idea here I'm

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,570
getting really specific but these things

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,600
are very flexible the point I'm making

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,860
here is that folks are coming in

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,810
introducing themselves to each other

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:35,630
saying this is who I am and what I'm

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:39,440
interested in but taking that not as an

00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:42,260
audience or you know a respective

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,940
students perspective but take that from

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,290
okay this is an active participant that

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,760
you're trying to take advantage of and

00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,320
make sure that their contribution helps

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,870
this thing along find out what they're

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,000
interested in and get them you know get

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,010
their wheels on the road to actually

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,960
making traction getting traction and

00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,910
actually bringing back the results of

00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:04,790
their research into the group so we can

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:06,680
learn from them and then the those

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,380
presentations that they make later are

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,960
just small presentations maybe 10

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,090
minutes or less depending on the context

00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,170
and the size of your training but

00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,880
they're really just to get the

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,500
conversation rolling and to point people

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,200
towards resources that they have found

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,550
or maybe to get the group to talk about

00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,810
topic questions that they have about

00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:30,320
these things another thing to consider

00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:33,140
in this type of training is that you

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,630
have rotating roles that people are

00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,550
actually dogfooding the process there

00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:39,380
someone's being timekeeping someone's

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,390
doing note-taking someone's actually the

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,690
facilitator who has you know somebody

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,770
whose best experience available is the

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,420
conciliator

00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,340
a convener which is somebody who

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,180
actually makes sure the venue is

00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:56,570
available whatever that would mean if it

00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:00,170
was online so basically you're splitting

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,460
up a complex role into subparts so

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,740
people can get experience with those

00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:08,320
small points because believe me I having

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:11,750
to combine time tracking scribing

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,640
note-taking and calling on people and

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,280
you know calling a meeting to order

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,530
those takes a huge amount of your brain

00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,269
and nervous system to do so breaking

00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:33,529
those small things up so that people can

00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:38,720
practice now that I have is some content

00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:46,839
ideas and see if I can find them okay

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:51,290
here I get it time check here okay yeah

00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:53,600
so possible to hop it so let's pretend

00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,629
again you have a group of people who've

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,689
decided okay you know there's only three

00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,819
to five of us but let's try this and see

00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:04,010
if it works okay here's a recommendation

00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:06,620
of how you might start let's say you're

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,899
going to have four meetings in your

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,529
first session you're just going to talk

00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:13,970
about big big-picture stuff

00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:16,370
why are we having the training the

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,589
importance what kind of resources are we

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,939
going to use reading videos

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,279
what-have-you

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,620
scheduling teacher events and then talk

00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:27,679
about some philosophy some theory you

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:31,100
know where is debian in this stuff why

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,049
do we need it and that way because this

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,909
topic is so broad because all these four

00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:37,909
topics are so broad people with their

00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:39,110
individual concerns can gear it towards

00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:41,000
what they're interested in maybe it's

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,880
anti harassment maybe it's issued

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,169
tracking forums that kind of thing

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,919
second session concepts vocabulary that

00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:53,570
kind of thing third session process this

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,789
is gets more implemented now we're

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,350
talking about how does Debbie and make

00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:00,139
decisions how does it make technical

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:04,220
decisions how does it make personnel

00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:05,779
membership decisions whether someone's a

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,100
developer or not or loses their

00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:08,690
development status you know these are

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,419
kind of like nuts and bolts of how we

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:14,990
actually do things but it also should be

00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:18,889
about in the best of all possible worlds

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:21,409
how do we make decisions when I did

00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:28,190
these kinds of trainings I would usually

00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:32,779
focus on this CT butlers on conflict and

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:34,419
consensus handbook written in late 70s

00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:37,330
early 80s

00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:42,009
and he was encoding some quite

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:45,100
particular Quaker process in terms of

00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:48,340
what he observed in activist groups at

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,519
that time so it's a it's a very cookbook

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,590
style book and I will promise to put a

00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,220
post of that up somewhere but what I

00:18:53,590 --> 00:19:01,570
would do is say okay this is Butler's

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:05,049
version of the flow chart that shows you

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,889
know first you get the agenda set you

00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,489
have introductions you call for concerns

00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:13,239
or what have you

00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:17,200
those are details of that on your fourth

00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:19,690
session techniques and then get into

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,989
more of the specifics of okay now we

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,340
know its overall process what are things

00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:27,340
you do during different parts of that

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,320
process so how do you call a groups

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,759
attention how do you deal with people

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,859
who are repeating themselves how do you

00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:35,279
keep things on topic how do you

00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:37,149
introduce topics how it's like a how-to

00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,470
for the things you talked about

00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:43,629
theoretically before and then repeat

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,340
that cycle perhaps you have an outside

00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:47,080
trainer that's been a consultant during

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,259
this process and maybe they'll stop

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,499
after the four weeks maybe they'll can

00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:55,450
continue on maybe you have some senior

00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:58,059
folks who've got a lot of history in

00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,980
Debian who promise to stick around for

00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:01,749
four weeks but they're not going to go

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,700
past four weeks or maybe you know if you

00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:06,220
can you'll have somebody continue for

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,739
another cycle so people can learn how it

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,570
is this cycle continues and if you have

00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:12,879
rolling admission that meeple people can

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,249
keep coming in I don't want to spend a

00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:22,419
lot more time unless people ask me too

00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:25,289
later about about those nuts and bolts

00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:27,580
I'd rather talk about the overall idea

00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:29,320
and I don't want people to get too

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,799
specific and say this is the way we have

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,799
to do it

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:41,330
the Debian Academy idea so here's

00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:44,659
something you could a proposal you could

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:48,559
put underneath that concept that that

00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:53,049
general idea so places in which this

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:57,019
kind of thing has worked well they grant

00:20:53,049 --> 00:21:00,200
pointed out to me that that I had

00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:04,000
forgotten that Latin America has a

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:07,460
strong reputation for these kinds of

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,250
literacy trainings getting huge amounts

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,380
of the part number of the population

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:16,370
from illiterate to book reading in a

00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:20,260
small number of years because you allow

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:23,029
people who have got some measurable

00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:27,320
simply measurable amount of competence

00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:29,899
say your measure is this person has gone

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:34,010
through the four part the four session

00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:37,610
cycle twice they're now being empowered

00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:43,700
to set up their own something as simple

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:46,220
is that can cause replication not just

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,080
self perpetuation but replication where

00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:52,159
you have it branching off lots of

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,620
branching in a way that is not a fork

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,679
necessarily meaning completely different

00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:01,510
project but more of a supportive rolling

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:05,000
out and delivery to a larger population

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:08,720
China did it quite successfully with

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,669
barefoot doctors getting herbal training

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,470
out after decades of war and and we're

00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:18,620
able to successfully get many many

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:22,190
people the kind of first aid and health

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,960
mental health training they needed the

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:28,399
example that I was first made familiar

00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:32,090
with was in the 1970s at a time when US

00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:34,850
and other European style cultures had

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:38,950
lost intergenerational knowledge about

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:41,179
breastfeeding so women were relying on

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,580
medical doctors telling them that

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:46,130
pollens were safer and when that

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,429
scientific education became clearly

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,429
wrong

00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,640
there was a large grassroots movement to

00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:57,380
Train for women to train each other on

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,570
how to breastfeed and raise children a

00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,549
healthy manner so an organization called

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:06,320
La Leche League which I believe this

00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:10,309
French just did something exactly like

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,620
this and in four sessions you read a

00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:14,390
book together and you had topics that

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,029
were as equivalently broad as the ones

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,990
I'm describing here and after you had

00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:20,480
gone through a certain number of

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:23,149
sessions you might be empowered by the

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:28,429
group to have the next assess meetings

00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:33,230
at your house and this was as far as I

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:36,529
know measurably connected to the very

00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:42,649
fast reuptake of best breastfeeding as a

00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:46,039
practice in the United States you know

00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:52,789
I'm not it's only it's about 20 minutes

00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:55,640
in that was about as much as I wanted to

00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:59,809
say I'd love to have questions because I

00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:03,610
might get some ideas about what more I

00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:03,610
was intending to saying once I hear I

00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:22,250
need to hear that on on IRC I everything

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:30,529
the question on IRC is is there a link

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:32,899
to the dealer project I did a link to

00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:35,960
the dealer project I have a personal

00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:41,419
webpage that just has a link to a few

00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:46,990
talks and it's @d Lib - rating gorg I

00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:46,990
don't know if you can see on my

00:24:51,880 --> 00:25:02,429
liberating org dealer - rating org again

00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:05,659
that my personal webpage

00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:08,639
but I do have that wiki and other

00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:09,720
project access and I can post things

00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:16,879
there and I would love to work with

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:16,879
people on Debian pages I'd be fine okay

00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:26,879
that's it then you so Duluth I have it

00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:44,820
typed on to the org-mode file I can put

00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:48,559
it on oh okay no one okay and vagrant

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:56,330
has posted the consensus dotnet on

00:25:48,559 --> 00:26:01,940
conflict and content in CAC contents

00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:04,559
file and that is I believe a GPL ish

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:09,119
version of the book I was telling you

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:14,759
about one of my students got it typeset

00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:17,179
and and opened up the syllabus nights

00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:17,179
again

00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:31,539
what flies are you asking for no I was

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:33,970
asking for the slides it's okay I don't

00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:39,960
know why they're not shy no they are

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:39,960
sewing it's everything all right okay

00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:50,590
how about ideas about possible ways in

00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:57,789
which Debian might be used use these

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:59,799
informations this information would key

00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:06,190
said that you remember the cafe

00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:09,669
conversation now yes we just didn't hear

00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:17,019
the last few 15 seconds or something you

00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:19,929
said could you repeat again could you

00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:24,879
repeat the last 15 seconds we just had a

00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:28,690
cut-off audio oh you missed the last 15

00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:32,590
seconds oh I was just a shot giving a

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:40,659
shout-out to wiki who I had lunch with

00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:42,340
and for you thank you well here's a

00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:46,269
question I have for the audience and

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:50,200
that is is the community team the right

00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:57,179
place for working on this kind of thing

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:57,179
I would guess it is

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:06,639
but answer for IRC probably yeah

00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:26,070
and I can be reached at delay at Deb

00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:30,690
camps org I found that that that email

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:33,390
is still working for me there's another

00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:36,690
question I understand you would like to

00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:39,840
organize a to organize a communication

00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:42,390
team and your employees organizing you

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,690
to peer Debbie and facilitation trading

00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,610
do you mean on making our manual for

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:53,660
organizing a team like this and

00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:59,670
instructing them before in events I

00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:03,860
think that question is very important

00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,860
I'm not parsing it exactly but

00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:20,490
so I guess the answer to that is yes the

00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:27,140
first question I would like to help

00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:32,700
Debbie and its ongoing communications

00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:36,210
training efforts one possible way to do

00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:39,320
that that I'm making available through

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:42,299
this is yes in a sense creating a

00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,549
training manual that I think that would

00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:46,380
be a good way to start

00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:50,130
I like wiki writing if people would like

00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:53,029
to work on this kind of things I could

00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:56,190
pay attention to it and help it along I

00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:58,200
prefer in face trainings so that's a

00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:11,100
difficulty but so that in text is the

00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:12,870
next best thing my feeling is we don't

00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:17,279
have anything better I like the

00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:19,350
community team to be a team of generally

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,809
respected people that we know to care

00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:24,179
about such aspects but it's an

00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:26,700
organization we will have to continue to

00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:32,039
hash and make better but it has to

00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:37,140
self-improve several iterations oh yeah

00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:42,080
and it's a go over of course yeah jimm

00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:48,149
off ganar yes that is the sense I have

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:50,399
that the community team is a you know

00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:52,529
it's been a head hop team for so long

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,390
it's just now getting formalized in

00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:56,880
terms of what its real responsibilities

00:30:54,390 --> 00:31:00,659
are and methods and that kind of thing

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:04,740
so what responsibilities it should and

00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:09,570
can have our open questions I understand

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:12,210
that doing trainings that allow people

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:16,320
to train themselves might be a possible

00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:20,360
way for communities team to have a role

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:23,130
that has a large impact without being

00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:27,740
pushed into a more regulatory role

00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,740
I think if the communities team doesn't

00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:35,940
doesn't do a lot in front of the public

00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:39,030
it will end just being the team of last

00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,280
resort as it has been in the past and so

00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:44,520
this is an idea how to be more proactive

00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:47,460
in a little less conflictual way rather

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:56,130
than just being the folks you call when

00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:59,010
when a problem comes up right and I'm

00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:01,020
here I'm seeing IRC now pre-training

00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,850
people could be usable to lots of teams

00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:06,360
not just community conflict resolution

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:10,830
of course right so you start with people

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:15,480
who already have either very high skills

00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:19,890
or very strong passion to learn more I

00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:22,170
in my experience what I see is that that

00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:24,480
the mixes of people who come on their

00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:28,320
own to such trainings in the real world

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,700
tend to be people who either want to get

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,830
better at their own expertise they

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,000
already have they want to learn how this

00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,520
organization does something they know

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,200
how to do elsewhere or they were having

00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,450
serious problems and neither they've

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,330
been told to go or they know they need

00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,760
some help so you end up with a real mix

00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,230
of people who have skills in dough which

00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,160
is actually fine it's just they're all

00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,160
talking about the same topic

00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:57,000
lookey is saying what you say is

00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,560
interesting but we're not sure what to

00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,450
do with it I think a lot of us would

00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,460
benefit from training and communicating

00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,950
better yes I understand

00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,140
I tend to be very interested in Deb comp

00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:10,890
because it's a place where I see real

00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,540
people learning to communicate with each

00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,490
other in terms of I think of everything

00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,560
in terms of communications so of course

00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:19,950
that's what I think of so I see real

00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,510
objects bodies in spaces learning who

00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,880
each other are and then either

00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,650
recovering from are adding to previous

00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,060
online communications they've had with

00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,800
each other that might have just been

00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:32,760
through code they're respected and

00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:35,390
probably maybe not even emails so or IRC

00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,590
or maybe they just had a couple bug

00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,120
conflict conversations and they don't

00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,190
even know who each other are so I see

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,670
this real rich community coming together

00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:47,850
during Deb comp but doing it online it

00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:51,180
needs to be a little bit more formal and

00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:57,980
so that's why I would ask for a team

00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:57,980
just set it up someone's asking

00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:08,560
so vagrant mentions Debian already has

00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:11,560
many small perhaps many too small teams

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,899
should each team be offered and or

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,109
encouraged to explore a set of sessions

00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:22,020
like this sure I don't know that this is

00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:24,609
a kind of thing that Debian is its own

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:30,359
Debian is its own world unto itself and

00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:30,359
so yes perhaps that's the case perhaps

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,720
you have the right room

00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:47,710
another person iMac I personally like

00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,629
the training system where you learn as

00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,909
you go and try to teach listens you just

00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:55,599
learn to to more people and learn some

00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:57,609
more people the time they need to teach

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,869
it is even more people and that time you

00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:02,369
learn some more in cetera yeah yeah yeah

00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:02,369
exactly self-perpetuating

00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,140
if some of this info gets shared is

00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,990
online that could be more yes I think

00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,180
that an online manual is really a

00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:23,280
logical place to start especially if we

00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,280
get it and to get or at least a wiki

00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:35,900
I'm seeing them flashing of information

00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:39,820
on juice and I don't understand what

00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,820
that is don't worry about it I guess

00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:48,320
MX's again so this could grow into

00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:50,300
Debian University sure that's some

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,340
reason why you might want to check out

00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,110
the possibility of doing it with other

00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,050
operating systems as well other

00:35:54,110 --> 00:36:00,470
communities don't this is a universal

00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,790
need I mean has it specifics in terms of

00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:05,740
its governance structure that will be

00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:09,290
different that are very different but

00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,730
working with other groups maybe setting

00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:14,780
up a for example there's something

00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:18,070
called peer-to-peer University and that

00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:22,450
is an online project and folks could

00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:22,450
from Debian could work through that

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,450
all right so now I'm getting an idea

00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:38,720
that I really wanted to throw and I

00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:41,330
forgot in terms of different groups each

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:46,250
doing this maybe independently or with

00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:48,530
each other a different proposal that I

00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:51,080
was actually hoping more specifically to

00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:54,680
work at in Taiwan on it Taiwan and

00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:59,950
didn't get a chance to work on was this

00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,950
idea of kind of a Chopin tell so I

00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:08,480
didn't tell you about this I forgot how

00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:19,250
much time do we have good we still have

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:22,310
time so in depth come to Taiwan I did a

00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:24,619
session that went very very well but it

00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:29,060
was unrecorded and it got some negative

00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:30,500
reviews after Deb Kampf 18 because it

00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,840
was unrecorded because there's such a

00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,840
strong culture around openness and

00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:38,780
sharing in Debian which is amazing so if

00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:41,300
I didn't again I would have it I would

00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:43,190
have I would record it if I went back in

00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,680
time I wouldn't record it because I

00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:47,869
didn't know then what I know now I think

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,550
I made the right decision but it did

00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:50,710
work and I think it would be safe to do

00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:54,740
it

00:37:50,710 --> 00:38:00,180
unrecorded and I don't I want to do this

00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:02,400
faster than I was intending he

00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,599
Damien is not just a software ethics

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,280
thing it could grow into a way of

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,190
organizing lifestyle of course yes

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,750
it is a lifestyle so I'm not going to

00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,950
pay attention to IRC here and try to say

00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:14,369
this quickly because I had a lot

00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:16,800
prepared so basically during that

00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:20,339
session it was entitled what works well

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,740
in Debian I recognized audience speakers

00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:25,650
when they raised their hands my goal was

00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:28,740
to desensitize sensitive topics and get

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:31,619
people who were struggling with previous

00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,650
wounds from conflicts it might even

00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:38,730
still be ongoing in some ways and I

00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:42,059
asked them very difficult questions

00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:48,059
about what worked well and what they

00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:52,680
could use helpless the actual questions

00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:56,490
that I used are useful I don't see where

00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:59,069
I put them in here but they were along

00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:01,410
the but what I did is I gave people ways

00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:04,559
in which they could answer the question

00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:07,829
that would put it in a positive sense

00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,790
and then ask them how they would ask for

00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:11,880
help and I gave him very specific

00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:13,470
questions to answer about that I should

00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,160
share that who I hope I remember to

00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:18,990
share those and the results were very

00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,500
very good there were people in the room

00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:26,010
who had been into very difficult issues

00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:29,069
the microphone was passed out they

00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:30,960
called on people I drew I asked just

00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:33,270
enough questions to draw out people who

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,000
were being reluctant and I said just

00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:41,880
enough try to cut back folks that were

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,099
long-winded politely and the result was

00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,400
that folks who had been on multiple

00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:50,460
sides of hard issues in the past each

00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,619
felt good remembering things that work

00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,000
really well in Debian and getting and

00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,859
hearing from other people things that

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,020
they didn't even know about that had

00:39:55,859 --> 00:40:02,780
worked well and so what I was trying to

00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,780
