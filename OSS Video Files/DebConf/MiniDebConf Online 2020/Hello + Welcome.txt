okay welcome to unit it can many DEFCON

00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,500
five nine day one even though there's

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,849
some technical glitch that comes from

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,510
somewhere that I don't know where it's

00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,029
coming from

00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:22,570
and do we have this up on the screen yes

00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:26,200
we do so here's a schedule for today all

00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,540
the times are on UTC there's a short URL

00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,640
link that you can share to your friends

00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,989
if you want them to join and all the

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,350
videos are available on videotape colg

00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:41,650
so we have six talks today and three are

00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,440
this morning in UTC here and in three no

00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,890
afternoon again after the lunch breaks

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,050
we hope you found the toilets by now and

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,260
like I said you can follow the talks on

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,000
videotape contract or either in the

00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,910
website that's probably going to be the

00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,180
easiest for most people all you can

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:04,239
watch it in your favorite video player

00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,710
we've got this guy to do your a little

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,450
bit because it will be different to

00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,869
everybody depending on where you're

00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,609
watching from so you can copy that top

00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:15,520
one into your video player it will use

00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:18,100
something called HLS that will switch

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,749
resolution and bitrate that dynamically

00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,789
depending on how good your connection is

00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:24,479
but if you want to force a bet right

00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:27,009
let's say you're an ID SLO 3G you can

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,749
choose one of the lower quality streams

00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:32,679
and try that out instead and force it to

00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:35,740
that so that you can watch the screen

00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:37,840
without being interrupted and if you

00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,139
want to ask questions you can ask

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,030
questions during a talk on IRC predicts

00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:46,659
the question of questioning capital

00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:49,029
marks in the colon we do this because

00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:51,759
there's a about a 30 second latency

00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:53,829
between the actual jitsi instance in the

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,139
stream so this way they talk Meister can

00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:59,709
collect some questions during the talk

00:01:56,139 --> 00:02:01,209
and pick the best ones or perhaps some

00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:03,249
are similar and they can collect them

00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:05,619
for the speaker at the end of the talk

00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:06,939
or in the talk my stay in the cuts or in

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:09,310
the speaker indicates that they're ready

00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:11,920
to speak so on that night is there any

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,260
questions or shall we get started in

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,010
about 15 minutes with the first talk why

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,010
more like 20 minutes

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:41,260
first question are you having fun today

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,670
so far see unless they are sent where

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,680
high voltage during his own voice yeah

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,290
why is that such a big punishment for

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,930
anyone and question are you having fun

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,849
today yeah I think we will hopefully we

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,620
will be more we'll see how the day

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:56,519
progresses hopefully I can kill my own

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,750
nickel and then we can get going and

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,250
enjoy the actual talks I'm sure the

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,370
first one at least will be good starting

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,840
and in 18 minutes that will be voted his

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,700
talk of X ray post something I'm

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,950
interested in but I would add time to

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:14,829
delve into and so just on that note we

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,359
hope you enjoy the talks this is mostly

00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:19,629
a collaboration between Def Con video

00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:21,190
team and that kind of content team so we

00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:23,530
hope it will be fun and that you all

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,169
enjoy it and we'll have a closing

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,299
