00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:52,220
coffee so this is the second edition of

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:56,840
the beacon fingers you the first edition

00:00:52,220 --> 00:01:00,560
was a long time ago we put a leg in 2004

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,770
as you can see some people who are very

00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,110
younger at that time but some things

00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:12,020
never change

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:13,909
and Brazil Accra Chiba is near from Sao

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,420
Paulo in the Rio de Janeiro probably

00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:20,840
this this are the city that you probably

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,380
heard a talk up heard about that about

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:28,340
them and the pota leg is the south so

00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:31,039
looking closer we can see Krita sample

00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:34,100
in the Rio de Janeiro pretty much the

00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:37,159
capital of the paranoid stage and the

00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:42,590
pollen estate is in the south of Brazil

00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:45,859
as you can see here so there it would be

00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:51,189
a to be winter there and someone can ask

00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:56,270
can we see snow there and the Queen said

00:01:51,189 --> 00:02:04,869
well we have is no in to true twice in

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:09,580
Curitiba in 1975 in 2013 how it was on

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:13,610
social network and it how it really was

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:16,849
there is no storm in Curitiba in 2013

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:21,380
and the south of Brazil was colonized

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:25,220
especially by immigrants from Riggins by

00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:27,190
by immigrants from Europe so we have in

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:31,420
the south

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:37,030
the immigrants from specially in paranÃ¡

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:41,590
from Russia Ukraine Poland Poland German

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:44,350
Germany Italian so in the south we can

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:49,720
see many small cities on the culture

00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:56,950
side with colonies from from people from

00:02:49,720 --> 00:03:03,250
here from Europe and by the way we know

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:06,910
how to mix you know me on the winter so

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:10,000

conference dinner with some local foods

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,780

00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:25,730

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:44,720
Carole's constellated because we did

00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:47,390
have requests for shooters this year we

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,990
are donating a projector for the venue

00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:55,310
because they the venue is a public

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:58,310
university and the projector of the big

00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:01,640
auditorium is broken so they asked the a

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:04,670
few quick uji we could buy a new one and

00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,070
we get we got approval from DPL and

00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,890
debian will provide a projector for the

00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:13,640
venue it's very nice to do that it's

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:16,370
because this venue received before me

00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,390
means that becomes twice and now the DEF

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:24,800
CON so you can help then donating a

00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:30,370
projector it's very expensive so eggs

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:34,300
are producing bags and everything

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:39,290

people especially from outside of Brazil

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:16,490
but we know that it's it's some kind of

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:19,910
difficult travel to Brazil

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:23,780
for many reasons but we are very happy

you in Curitiba and we hope we can make

00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:52,580
a great that because this year we should

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:54,740
take a few questions so coming from the

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,490
northern part of Europe I'm curious what

00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:01,280
you mean by cold so what is the average

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:04,310
temperature you the guest of you of the

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,180
temperature there yep in the older

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:11,890
winter you can have from zero never

00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:17,210
below zero but you can have zero at that

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:21,740
later night and you can have 20 girls

00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:26,540
Celsius so it's it's not so cold for

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:31,880
people from Europe right or especially

00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:36,080
there's this the side of Europe but even

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:41,180
so we can have some hot days we call a

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:45,200
small summer inside the winter there the

00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:46,970
temperature can be more than 20 for few

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,220
days and after that the temperature

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:56,660
below again drop again so I basically

00:19:51,220 --> 00:20:00,920
2010 10 5 10 15 - 15 years their average

00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:02,930
there what about rainfall sorry so what

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,550
about rain is it going to rain or is

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,920
there a high percentage it's going to

00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:09,340
rain all the time or a row being no it's

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:13,240
dry it's a dry winter yeah

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:19,389
we can have some some a little rain but

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:23,529
it's it's heretic but basically it's a

00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:26,110
dry winter you mentioned swag so what

00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:29,110
will be provided I mean for example in

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:33,820
Canada we had to have our own cups for

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:35,860
coffee in Taipei we had we we had cups

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,059
provided so what should we take with us

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:42,610
cool

00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:46,919
well we have our bag cups we are

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:50,710
providing probably two cups one for

00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:54,629
small for hot drinks and other for a big

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:58,539
one for beer or other odd kind of drinks

00:20:54,629 --> 00:21:01,450
t-shirts and the what you are we were

00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:03,879
planning to make some local flip-flops

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:08,230
that we call awareness of Ionis it's a

00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:10,179
it's a brandy but we are concerning

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:13,210
because of the budgets we have to buy

00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:15,909
the projector so you have to spend off

00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:18,129
if days so it decided to cancel the

00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:22,330
production of the Awareness Day

00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:23,580
flip-flop basically and the daily art

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,970
Leonard's

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:35,549
lien artists and I think so

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:35,549
just this yeah some questions

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:50,640
I'm just curious what is your animal

00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:55,740
mascot the mascot ah

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:58,680
this it's a it's an animal there that

00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,470
it's it's been extinct seated

00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:06,780
it's a I don't know the name I got a

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:33,390
name in English it's a and yes the name

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:40,890
is I have double d double D I don't know

00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:43,470
but that is flag right in English and we

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:48,060
wrote about that so they have a big

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:50,670
thought that they can eat ants

00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:54,030
oh yeah the names has something about

00:22:50,670 --> 00:23:00,270
ants because heat heats and it eats and

00:22:54,030 --> 00:23:02,850
so this is Muscat what about networks

00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,050
they're Wireless what's the brand worth

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,960
can't say anything about that

00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:10,200
yes the university has a wireless

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,870
network in the promise to us that you'll

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:19,010
be very nice there to be very good we

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:21,810
hope so I'm not sure the the speed there

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:26,070
but I know that all the venue you can

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:29,280
access I Wi-Fi wireless wireless network

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:32,820
and at the hotel we are we are

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:41,130
contracting exclusively link to the the

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:43,140
heck lab it's 200 and we will have to to

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,600
configure it the network the Wi-Fi on

00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,150
the heck lab because they are the hotel

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,500
has our own Wi-Fi but is not very good

00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:54,890
so you are by one network one link just

00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,890
for us

00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:01,160
you see so let me see if there's any

00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:06,080
