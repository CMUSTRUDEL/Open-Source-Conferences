So many things have been written about the ancient history of computers. The "Unix Wars", the "locking in of customers", the real value of FOSS. maddog had a unique position and has a unique perspective due to having of been in a series of positions at Digital Equipment Corporation where many of these historic issues came to be. Things happen because of reasons, and many times those reasons are not known. After 50 years, perhaps it is time to know, so we can avoid these mistakes in the future.

hello bozhe unfortunately that's the

00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,440
last Portuguese you're here out of me

00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:46,239
today unless I have to ask where the

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:52,089
sanitary is hard my talk today is 50

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:53,970
years of X Unix Linux and other things

00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:59,019
and why I feel that's important

00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:03,280
my name is John Dingell Hall Dingell is

00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:05,439
Mandarin for Mad Dog and I am the chief

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,509
executive officer of a company called

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:12,250
Upton as of July of 2017

00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:14,650
I'm also the board chairman of the linux

00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,650
professional institute and i'm the

00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,600
president of project kawan and i'm the

00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,520
co-founder and advisor to a program

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,790
called caninus lucas which we'll talk

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,869
about later first of all I am really old

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,409
next year I will have been in the

00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:34,090
computer industry for 50 years I've

00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:39,070
worked on a wide variety of different

00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:43,150
systems computers that physically would

00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:46,000
fill this room but logically are we less

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:49,479
powerful than even the simplest cell

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,490
phone I've been coming to Latin America

00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:57,490
since 1996 and I have a unique

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,930
relationship with you I've been a wide

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,590
variety of different things

00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:04,750
in my life I've taught operating system

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,229
design and compiler theory and I really

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:10,239
love compiler theory and I've worked on

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,780
very large systems and very small ones

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,629
and unlike some people in the free

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:21,430
software space I like to think of myself

00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:25,530
as pragmatic which means I use software

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:29,170
to get the job done that's what I do I

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:34,349
will give you a warning the unpacking 50

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:37,099
years of history into this one-hour talk

00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:39,750
and my memory isn't what it used to be

00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:42,239
so for those people who are going to

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,280
argue with me and say no this happened

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,000
exactly this way or I disagree with you

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:53,790
that's fine you can send it to email

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,560
there is def null this is my record oops

00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,150
I don't need that and don't need the

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:04,650
Wi-Fi this is my record of my dedication

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:08,069
to Brazil I came here in 1996 and I saw

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:12,959
the University of South Paulo 100,000

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:16,290
students 16,000 PhDs and I saw my very

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,019
first beowulf system there my very first

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:22,319
physical supercomputer I saw at the

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,389
University and I saw that they won many

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,739
awards year after year in the

00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:30,299
supercomputer in contests in 2002 I

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,659
bought the linux professional institute

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:37,079
here to start certifications of linux

00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:41,310
professionals and the first LPI certs in

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:44,040
brazil in 2005 I became the president

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,530
project caua whose main goal was to

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,620
create millions of jobs with a secondary

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,900
goal of environmental use of computers

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:57,120
as well as making them easier to use I

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,849
don't believe the computers will ever be

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,859
easy to use until they can get to the

00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:04,470
point where I can talk to them and they

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:08,940
can talk back to me like I am talking to

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:12,479
you in 2011 I started a project called

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,030
caninus Lukas to try and reduce the cost

00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:20,280
of single board computers like the

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:22,650
Raspberry Pi here in Brazil 2012

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,220
I became co-owner of the hospital beer

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,289
club where we have 29 craft beers on tap

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:34,020
and I'm going to be spending this

00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:36,630
evening there it is in Curitiba in 2017

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:41,070
I marry difference again and I'm very

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:44,920
happy with my partner and in 2018 I

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:49,900
became the chief executive officer for

00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:52,780
Pattaya I'm going to take you back to

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,760
the very beginning of computers this is

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,060
before the transistors before he

00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,460
degraded circuits transistors were there

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,130
but they were physically huge you could

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,740
actually walk inside of them and we

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,050
needed to have air conditioners that are

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,020
measured in the tons of coat of cooling

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:14,350
power the memories were measured in

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,560
kilobytes not megabytes or gigabytes or

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:20,530
terabytes in fact I remember at a point

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,930
in my life why I had to practice saying

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:26,530
the word gigabyte and trying to realize

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:30,340
how big it was and now I think about how

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:34,330
small it is the disks were measured in

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,840
megabytes and we and typically back in

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,410
those days

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,110
you ran programs one at a time a lot of

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:44,830
computers even mainframes did not really

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,140
have an operating system you linked the

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,380
device drivers into your program and

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,360
then you booted the program a little bit

00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:56,200
like Arta we notice are done today

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,570
and the operating systems if they were

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,240
and if there was an operating system was

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,250
very specialized it had to be

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,930
specialized the architecture of the

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,180
machine because a lot of the

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,190
architectures were different we were

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,310
still experimenting with architectures

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:15,880
back in those days and we were also

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:18,270
specialized in a type of program or the

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,890
type of problem we were trying to solve

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,470
so you would have some systems that were

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,960
oriented towards batch and running jobs

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,510
one at a time you have some systems are

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,860
oriented towards time sharing and some

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,970
systems that were oriented towards

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:38,230
real-time there was kind of a myth going

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:40,360
around and maybe the 1980s about how all

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,790
these computer vendors were trying to

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,220
lock you into their computer systems and

00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,780
this was why they invented all these

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,710
different things in their operating

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:53,260
systems I never remembered a single

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,330
conversation that went like that I never

00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,280
remembered a single engineer who sat

00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,880
down and said let's see what we can do

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,600
to

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,120
like our customers into our system the

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,370
comments were always how can we make our

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,110
system more efficient how can we make it

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,670
so that our customers can do the work

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,890
better faster and easier if we had tried

00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,680
if we said that we created a different

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:20,680
operating system to lock our customers

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,760
in then we only would have needed one

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,950
operating system on the pdp-11 and as it

00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,700
was there were over 11 different

00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:33,490
operating systems on the pdp-11 rt-11

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,680
for real-time are a sex for combination

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,170
of real-time and time sharing visit us

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,730
for an educational system IAS for help

00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,620
for health you know doors UNIX back in

00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,990
those days

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:50,440
why would we need so many if our sole

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:53,830
goal was to lock our customers into

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,590
systems this is an urban legend I

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:59,680
believe I never remembered even one time

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:05,260
having that now I'm going to take you

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:09,310
back to 1969 I was a young student at

00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,170
Drexel University in 1969 people walked

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,800
on the moon for the first time and the

00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:16,300
whole planet paid attention to that no

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,580
matter what country you're in you were

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:23,350
glued to the television set to watch

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:25,930
this miracle happen also in 1969 the

00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:30,700
ARPANET was started the predecessor to

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:33,729
the internet in 1969 leda's Torvalds was

00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:37,030
born yes leanness will be 50 years old

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,580
this year it makes me feel incredibly

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:42,160
old

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:45,490
because in 1969 I wrote my first program

00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:50,860
I took a correspondence course in how to

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:53,950
program the IBM 1130 in Fortran that

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,670
spelled with all capital letters not

00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,940
Fortran

00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:02,260
to Fortran for Fortran 77 Fortran 95

00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,930
performance Fortran just Fortran because

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,170
with that and COBOL why would you need

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:13,339
any other language

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:14,930
in 1969 I shaved for the last time but

00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:19,850
more importantly to the people in this

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:22,490
room in 1969 in Berry Hill New Jersey at

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,890
Bell Laboratories a man named Kenneth

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:30,230
Thompson decided he wanted to play space

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:32,120
Wars on a computer and he decided along

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,149
with his cohort and friend Dennis

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:41,600
Ritchie to write this operating system

00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:44,690
which became known as Unix now in those

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,820
days most of the software which was

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,910
distributed was distributed in source

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,250
code form the reason for that was that

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,130
there wasn't enough of any one type of

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,520
computer to really make it worthwhile to

00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:03,580
create a binary distribution of anything

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:08,330
I was working for a very large computer

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:12,829
companies company in 1973 and I remember

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:15,800
purchasing I remember purchasing a

00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:19,240
compiler from a company that was selling

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:22,990
it the compiler was very efficient and

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,850
generated code devan very quickly and

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:29,180
the compiler only costs us one hundred

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:33,380
and thirty thousand US dollars back in

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:35,750
1973 to put this in perspective that

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,480
same year my parents bought a

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:41,240
three-bedroom house with living room

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,950
dining room family room full basement on

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:49,790
a quarter acre of land for $32,000

00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:51,740
so this compiler costs three houses but

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:55,550
it was worth it because it produced code

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:59,000
that ran 30% faster and when you bought

00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:01,310
a 2.5 million dollar computer having

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,529
code of an a third faster was like

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:09,500
getting back one third of your computer

00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:12,950
and so it was justified we signed a

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,839
contract for that for that compiler we

00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:18,589
had to negotiate with the company for

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:20,840
days weeks to sign the contract for it

00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:24,020
and after we signed the contract

00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,260
paid the money this engineers showed up

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:29,930
with a magnetic tape and they spent a

00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,270
week at our site getting that back being

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,870
the compiler on that magnetic tape to

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:38,390
work on our system because the first

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,130
thing you had to do was assemble a small

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,410
version of the compiler and then use

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:45,370
that compiler to build another one this

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,530
sounds I'm sure familiar to many of you

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,010
but after the engineer spent the week

00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,930
here

00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,150
they would laugh they left and got back

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:58,550
home but they did not take the tape with

00:11:53,150 --> 00:12:00,230
them the tape stayed with us because we

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,720
were going to have the source code in

00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:07,550
case our company disappeared and we

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:10,160
needed to fix the problems there were no

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,990
software copyrights or patents when

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,300
software back in those days that did not

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:19,820
happen till about 1986 when ROM started

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,910
to come out for games and they wanted to

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,580
protect that so before that time you

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,140
could not protect your code with

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:30,260
copyright or patents at least in the

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:33,440
United States there were few

00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,870
professional engineers in fact I

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,040
remember a professor at my university

00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:42,310
telling me John you will never be able

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:48,140
to earn a living as a professional

00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:50,890
engineer I'm only 67 years old now I'm

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:54,070
still waiting to see if he was right

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:57,500
but back in those days you were

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:59,360
physicists and you wrote programs to

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,710
solve your problems you are chemists and

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,740
you wrote programs to solve your

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:06,650
problems you wrote the programs to solve

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,630
your problem and then when you got

00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,610
finished with it you would say to

00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:14,630
yourself well what am I going to do with

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:18,320
this now you probably are aware that

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:20,150
selling software is a very hard job you

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,270
have to set up a support team you have

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:25,970
to write documentation you have to you

00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,860
know be able to accept bugs you have to

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,590
advertise your code and so forth and so

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,610
on and all of these things take away

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:36,870
time for what your real job is

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:39,450
as a physicist or chemist or whatever so

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:43,260
you might contribute your source code to

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:45,510
a library such as dicus with share or

00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,550
Mindstorm or any one of the libraries or

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:50,040
you could take your code and put it up

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,149
on a bulletin board that people could

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,970
dial up at 1200 bits per second or you

00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:58,980
know whatever speed they had or you

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,920
could contribute your code to a user

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,800
group either a physicist user group or

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,190
whatever but in any case you contributed

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,190
your code and sometime later you might

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,230
go to a conference and somebody would

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,230
walk up to you and say oh you're the

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,149
person that wrote that code all it was

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,190
such a great code yeah I have some ideas

00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:23,640
about you mind if I if I give you some

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,690
pieces of code to to improve it of

00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,930
course not

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:31,709
if you think about it you just doubled

00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:33,779
your staff if a third person worked up

00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:35,700
you tripled your staff you have three

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:39,449
people working on that piece of code now

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,339
and then maybe somebody would say well I

00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:45,769
don't know how to code but let me buy

00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:48,060
you a beer well let me buy you dinner

00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:51,060
well don't you want to come and work for

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,519
my company and these are some of the

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:57,540
reasons why we write free software today

00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:01,699
we need it for our own use we're looking

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:04,920
for help in making our ideas viable and

00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:11,699
yes it could lead to a job or other

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:13,140
things now as I said back in those days

00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,699
there were many different operating

00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,449
systems with many different it's because

00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:22,709
the computers were so weak and miserable

00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:25,440
and crappy and small that they really

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:27,660
couldn't handle a general purpose of

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,380
what we think of today as a general

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:34,560
purpose operating system so Ken Thompson

00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,740
and Dennis Ritchie started with this

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,079
little cast-off computer called a PDP 7

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,510
at Bell Laboratories it was sitting in

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,200
the hallway nobody wanted it anymore

00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:48,250
because the memory was real

00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:51,980
small it couldn't even host its own

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,930
assembler and so they went to another

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:58,700
computer system and used a cross

00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:01,130
assembler to punch the paper tape that

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,200
would then be loaded onto the PDP seven

00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,400
and they would run it and they would see

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,250
what was wrong and then they would go

00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,880
back and change the assembly language

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:13,640
back on the other computer do you say

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,380
okay well that's cross assembling cross

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,790
compiling and all of us have done that

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:22,670
from time to time except the method of

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:26,150
carrying the data back and forth was

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:28,010
punched paper tape and a machine that

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:31,010
read that punch paper tape could read it

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:35,360
at approximately five characters per

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:38,270
second so if your operating system was

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,310
any size at all it took a long time to

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:43,040
punch out the paper tape and then read

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:46,730
it on the other system and just to come

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,460
up with some type of an error so they

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,200
decided that the little operating system

00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:55,610
was going to have a very small kernel

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:58,550
with a minimum of functionality inside

00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,280
of the kernel and that did several

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:05,900
things it made it easier to get it right

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:09,170
and eventually when Dennis Ritchie wrote

00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:12,220
the C language they translated it into C

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:15,860
so that it was more maintainable and

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:19,339
also more portable across different

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:21,199
hardware and these were the types of

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,140
things that UNIX started to do because

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,839
remember operating systems up until that

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,620
point were specifically tailored to a

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:32,960
piece of hardware to make it work faster

00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:35,540
but in Ken's and Dennis's mind it was

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,290
more important to have the operating

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:41,270
system portable and have the people

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,980
portable that you could have the same

00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,340
operating system with the same

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:50,030
interfaces across all of these different

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:52,700
pieces of hardware and of course they

00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,410
distributed in source code Ken would go

00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,690
out with his little tape underneath his

00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,750
arm as he went on sabbatical he loved

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,200
teaching he loved

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:03,480
working with students and he would try

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,230
and demonstrate operating system design

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,990
using his favorite operating system UNIX

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:12,420
and this allowed universities and

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,400
companies and governments to contribute

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:18,680
to this

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:21,870
now unfortunately UNIX was never free

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,960
it was never free of intellectual

00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:27,900
property it was never free of cost in

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,530
order to work on a UNIX system if you

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,360
weren't a research university

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:37,710
you had to pay one hundred and sixty

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:42,090
thousand dollars per CPU now remember

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:44,550
the house wait this is five houses you

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:48,120
are paying just to get the right to put

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,650
the software on one computer if you

00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,830
wanted to put it on another computer

00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:56,610
here's another $160,000 a third computer

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:58,410
was another $160,000 this is the

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:02,070
telephone company they really didn't

00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:04,560
understand volume discounts but the

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,660
worst part of it was that you had to

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,440
tell them the serial number of the

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,600
computer that you were putting it on and

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,370
to find the person inside the telephone

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,410
companies it actually would accept that

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,840
serial number and check it off and say

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,370
ok you can buy the software you can pay

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,210
me the hundreds of sixty thousand

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:27,390
dollars was very difficult if your

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,220
computer system broke and you wanted to

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,370
transfer it to another one you had to

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,560
call that person up first and say yes I

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:38,520
want to transfer it here's a serial

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:42,870
number of the next computer so this

00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:46,260
caused kind of a problem in the UNIX

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:50,340
industry but in 1982 Sun Microsystems

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:52,640
had this very nice little board that was

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,770
developed at Stanford University and

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,980
they wanted to bring this out as a piece

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,810
of hardware a workstation and they

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,240
looked around for an operating system

00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,580
they actually came to Digital Equipment

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,880
Corporation and they wanted to get our

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,790
VMS operating system but unfortunately

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,830
two things

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,000
Digital did not want to sell it to them

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,299
that was a big mistake

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,890
and secondly a lot of our operating

00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:22,820
system was written in assembly language

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:24,290
and therefore was not as portable as it

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,799
would have been it would have been very

00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:31,160
difficult to make the VMS system work

00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:33,590
when this workstation so they looked

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,360
around some more and one of the people

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,570
starting to company was a person named

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:42,380
Bill joy who had worked on the bsd unix

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:46,280
project and he said let's use bsd unix

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:49,730
and so they went to AT&T and negotiated

00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:53,929
for a binary-only license that was

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:56,390
considerably cheaper it was about $350

00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:58,760
for an unlimited number of people and

00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:02,330
even less if you're only going to put

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:05,990
two people on the system that's strange

00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:09,710
to people why two people why not just

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:11,270
one person well you could be logged in

00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,299
and what happens if somebody wants to

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,970
send you a message as uucp

00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:21,200
he need a second login for that and

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:23,390
that's why it was two people now other

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,419
companies started to follow this because

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:28,880
they didn't want to be left behind and

00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:34,130
most of these companies were BSD

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:37,250
oriented not system five why because

00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:39,770
system five was still a swapping style

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,260
of virtual memory if you had to have

00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:44,510
your entire program someplace in the

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,780
memory and you could swap out your

00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:50,710
program and swap another one in but it

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:53,570
was not demand paged virtual memory

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:56,270
system five at the time only included

00:21:53,570 --> 00:22:01,640
two compilers to see compiler and

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:05,110
Fortran 77 but almost most importantly

00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:09,710
its method of networking was called uucp

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:11,750
unix - unix copy so if I wanted to send

00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,780
a file from one place to another that

00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:18,590
file was first copied to another system

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:22,809
a hub and then from there was copied to

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,809
another system and kept hopping across

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,590
BSD on the other hand

00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:31,800
had demand paged virtual memory which is

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:36,450
very important it included three

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:38,370
compilers C Fortran 77 and Pascal Pascal

00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,700
was a very big language in those days

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:44,990
and a lot of universities were using it

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:49,380
but again almost most importantly it had

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:52,050
tcp/ip and that made a lot of difference

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:55,830
to a lot of vendors because allowed you

00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:57,690
to set up a reasonable networking now a

00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,550
digital we were trying to decide which

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:04,080
one to support and from a technical

00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:06,390
standpoint BSD was the way to go there

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,950
was one other thing that might happen

00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,410
the might have steered us in a different

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,120
direction and that was the fact that the

00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:16,670
University of California had no

00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:20,430
marketing budget for Berkeley UNIX but

00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:24,330
system AT&T definitely pushed system

00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:27,480
five constantly for five years with a

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:30,710
two-page advertisement in computer world

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:34,590
magazine system five the right choice

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:40,260
but even with all of that people tended

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:42,510
to use the BSD system base there was one

00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,630
person that was not very happy with this

00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:48,450
moved to binary distributions though you

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:53,670
probably can guess who that was mr.

00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:55,620
Stallman at MIT he didn't like that he

00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,990
wanted to see the source code for the

00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:00,060
operating system he needed to write

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,690
device drivers for things and he

00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:06,660
couldn't see how to do it and so in 1983

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,780
he introduced the good new project foo

00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,510
canoeist not Unix and he wanted to build

00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:16,290
a complete operating system and have all

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:18,420
the source code available in 1985 he

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,980
created a free software foundation to

00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:24,120
help to fund this and to give some

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:27,240
structure to it now an interesting thing

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:31,020
about that was he didn't start with the

00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,610
kernel of the operating system you know

00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,980
you might think oh well why don't you

00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,260
start with the the basic first start

00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,720
with the kernel but think about it

00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,730
if he had started with the colonel and

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,960
he got finished there'll be no

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:47,700
applications to run on top of it and you

00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,880
know so nobody would buy it and by the

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:54,030
time the applications came his colonel

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,410
would be obsolete and so he said he

00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:58,580
started with something that almost

00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:03,090
everybody today used a text editor

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,610
called Emacs some people say that he

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,840
could have stopped with Emacs

00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:10,890
because it's like a whole operating

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,770
system I personally am a vim person

00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:15,660
don't boo

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:18,630
but then he went on to create a compiler

00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:21,240
suite now that's another odd thing why

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:23,820
would he create a compiler suite well

00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,960
back in those days each vendor would

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:31,020
have their own C compiler as an example

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,809
Dyck had one decade one you know HP had

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:38,400
one and yes there were standards in the

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:41,250
language but the compilers were not

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,080
perfect and so in the middle of your

00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,679
code you might have to put some if

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,540
deaths to get around the fact that

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,830
digital C compiler did something this

00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:56,910
way and IBM C compiler did it something

00:25:52,830 --> 00:26:00,059
different and the syntax and the

00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:03,240
semantics even if the syntax was correct

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:06,990
the semantics of the compiler might be

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,059
different and by using the GU new suite

00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:12,720
that ran across all these different

00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:16,320
operating systems you could eliminate a

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,020
lot of your if deaths eliminate a lot of

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,010
your branches and testing which meant

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:26,400
real savings in money and so companies

00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:29,160
like Boeing that were required by the

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,040
government to use operating systems and

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,070
architectures from different companies

00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:37,620
they use the Guddu compiler suite and

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:41,370
they paid a small company called Cygnus

00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:43,980
to provide support for that eventually

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:46,679
Cygnus of course was purchased by Red

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,330
Hat and still those people still exist

00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,000
today

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:55,620
after the compiler suite he went with

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,970
utilities bash shall other utilities and

00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:03,630
bit by bit he created enough to replace

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:07,200
almost every necessary version of the

00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:10,289
UNIX operating system and this also

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,380
allowed even more people to be portable

00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:14,940
across this because from vendor to

00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,909
vendor there might be some small

00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,760
differences in the utilities of things

00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:24,950
that would upset people upset shell

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:28,679
scripts and in the last days of Sun a

00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:31,799
lot of times people would order Solaris

00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:35,220
and immediately throw away all of the

00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:40,529
Sun utilities and to get the good news

00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:43,139
suite and put it on top this top-down

00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:45,600
approach also allowed small companies to

00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:50,039
start up providing support of different

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:52,260
types to free software and they packaged

00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:55,590
up the software people like like walnut

00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:58,049
Creek's cd-rom and others and made it

00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,820
easier to use for people who weren't

00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:02,880
used to compiling things from source

00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,490
code people provided support companies

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,210
for the software and made money that way

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:14,399
I worked for Digital Equipment

00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:17,399
Corporation from 1983 to 1999 and we

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,820
supported UNIX at first on some of our

00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:22,559
machines for the telephone companies and

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,559
universities we would write device

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,929
drivers for them we would help them use

00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:32,610
their UNIX systems with code it came

00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:35,639
from either AT&T or Berkeley but you had

00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,440
to have a source code license for it and

00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:41,610
so you either had to be a research

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,880
university or you had to be have the

00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:47,190
paid the money to AT&T

00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:50,909
so when Sun Microsystems brought out

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:53,460
their binary-only version we determined

00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:59,460
to bring out our binary only for

00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:02,550
and we released that in 1984 this

00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:05,400
started to create the UNIX Wars all the

00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:08,820
different vendors trying to push their

00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,970
UNIX system and gain point of the market

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:15,360
share most of this was in the scientific

00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:18,300
and technical space you know physicists

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,730
chemists things like that or in software

00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:24,180
development where all of the tiny little

00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:26,460
tools in UNIX could allow you to develop

00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,880
your software and deploy it across

00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,260
multiple systems to build it on all

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,660
these systems because the good news

00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:38,940
suite was there to act as a compiler

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:41,490
back in those days the good news suite

00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,670
did not generate code that was very

00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:47,870
efficient using the canoe compilers

00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:51,270
might generate code that would only be

00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:55,050
70% as efficient as a commercial

00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:58,830
compiler but as computers became faster

00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:01,320
and faster that extra 30% performance

00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:05,490
was not necessarily useful or necessary

00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:09,270
and people made to trade off of the ease

00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:11,940
of maintain their code versus the speed

00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:13,830
that you would get if you needed a

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,230
computer if you needed an answer faster

00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:20,340
you just bought a faster computer that's

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:22,740
what T the answer was as I said this is

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,470
mostly at a technical space the

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:29,070
commercial space business and so forth

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:35,910
and so on still was mostly in mainframes

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:38,730
badges but about 84% of the market and

00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:41,750
that's still true today about 84 percent

00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:46,880
is oriented towards commercial work and

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:46,880
16% is still in the scientific world

00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:53,910
about that time an organization called

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:56,040
UNIX system labs came up AT&T felt they

00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,410
were losing control of the UNIX market

00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,990
actually they lost control a long time

00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:03,930
before that but they joined with Sun

00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:06,750
Microsystems to form UNIX system labs

00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:10,640
and Sun Microsystems when

00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:14,760
from Sun OS which was a highly-tuned

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:19,320
Berkeley based system to supporting

00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:23,520
system 5 with Solaris which in the early

00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,880
days we called it slow lares because

00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,680
they were taking they were going from a

00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,470
highly-tuned berkeley system which was

00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:36,450
very efficient unto this thing that was

00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:38,430
basically sample code from AT&T that

00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:42,030
never really been a commercial product

00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:45,480
and their engineers had to spend two

00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:51,360
years breed even close to performance

00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:53,730
that they had with Sun OS digital HP IBM

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,600
and others there were seven companies at

00:31:53,730 --> 00:32:00,420
all formed OSF in 1988 to kind of combat

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,970
this they were afraid of being locked

00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:05,280
out of the UNIX market by Sun and AT&T

00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,530
defining what the standards of UNIX was

00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,420
going to be so they formed an

00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:12,810
organization called the open Software

00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:16,590
Foundation and they set up a set of

00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:19,470
standard api's and standards and a test

00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:22,380
suite you didn't have to use their

00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:24,720
sample implementation as long as you

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,060
made sure that your api's and your

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,910
operating system could support the test

00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:34,890
suite and from that many of their

00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:37,200
companies were able not have to change

00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:39,720
their operating system much at all but

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:45,360
still were able to call it Decca or call

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:47,370
it OSF 1 or later on UNIX a digital

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,800
actually used the sample in the

00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:51,600
implementation it came from Carnegie

00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,450
Mellon based on its Carnegie Mellon's

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,270
mock and we came out with a product

00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:03,360
which we call dec OSF 1 or later on Dec

00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:05,700
UNIX now in 1991 there was a small

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,000
corporation set up by some of the people

00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,830
from Berkeley Mike Carroll's Kirk

00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,290
McKusick

00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:16,410
and a bunch of others called bsdi

00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:18,870
and they brought out a little operating

00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,160
system that they sold both the binaries

00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:23,300
and the sources

00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:27,750
for only about a thousand US dollars

00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:29,940
they were rapidly sued by AT&T because

00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:32,150
of course they hadn't paid the 160

00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,340
thousand dollars for the license and

00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:40,710
this lawsuit went on for a number of

00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:44,160
years until 1994 the lawsuit as it

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,940
dragged through allowed the BSD people

00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:50,550
to actually rewrite most of the code

00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:54,180
eliminating all the AT&T intellectual

00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:56,910
property until there was only about 17

00:33:54,180 --> 00:34:00,690
files that had anything that looked like

00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:04,110
AT&T source code in it and when the

00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:06,660
judge finally said okay though these 17

00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:09,570
files are the bad ones they quickly

00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:12,480
rewrote those to producing a

00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:15,600
distribution called BSD Lite which

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:23,310
became the basis of FreeBSD OpenBSD

00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:27,270
and others by 1991 most of the GU new

00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:29,490
operating system was in place and a

00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:32,220
young university student in Helsinki

00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:35,300
Finland decided that the operating

00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:39,210
system that came with his new computer

00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:42,120
was really a piece of crap and he wanted

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:45,870
to have the UNIX system but he couldn't

00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:48,360
afford it and so he decided to write a

00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,020
new kernel and of course you know that

00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,780
story

00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:57,330
it was leanness and he started to write

00:34:51,780 --> 00:35:03,530
Linux now why did this happen why was it

00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:07,500
1991 why at that time was as possible

00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:11,730
first of all you had powerful but cheap

00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:15,320
computers the 286 was only capable of

00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:18,660
supporting a swapping operating system

00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:22,740
remember the early days of UNIX swapping

00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:24,930
was bad demand page was good the 386 was

00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:28,920
the first Intel processor that could

00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:31,920
support demand page virtual memory when

00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,990
leanness got his brand-new 386 for

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,990
christmas

00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:40,530
he recognized that it could support a

00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:42,810
reasonable operating system now to be

00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:46,140
fair to the operating system that came

00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:50,040
with his sweetie six they had that

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:54,930
company had to support all the 286 186

00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:58,200
is 8086 --is that came before and those

00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:00,210
were all swapping systems just because a

00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,610
few people with a lot of money could buy

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,340
a 3d six they were going to change their

00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:08,720
entire operating system just for that

00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:12,290
group of people and so Microsoft

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:16,950
continued to put out dos and windows and

00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:19,140
Lina's said I want something better the

00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:22,530
other thing that happened was that over

00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:26,270
time the 386 is the people purchased for

00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:29,520
a lot of money became older machines and

00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:32,220
you won't know when to buy a 486 or

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,090
something newer now you had the 3d six

00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:38,340
there was a secondary machine something

00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:42,600
that maybe you could use to do a project

00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:43,920
or like write an operating system and so

00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,230
there was a lot of these machines

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,840
starting to appear to people say yes I

00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:53,450
can use this to write this operating

00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:56,400
system and contribute to this cause

00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:58,950
another thing was that faster internet

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,330
was coming to the home it wasn't just

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,300
dial up anymore

00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:06,570
people could actually get DSL and other

00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:09,510
types of broadband internet entered her

00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:11,460
house it wasn't just they didn't have to

00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,530
do to work at the University they didn't

00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,200
have to do the work at their company

00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:19,620
after hours they could do it in their

00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:23,460
home and there was a lot of information

00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:26,460
online and examples of operating systems

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:29,190
of different types MINIX was out there

00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,470
you can see the source code for that the

00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:35,040
BSD code was out there you could see the

00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:37,590
source code for that the World Wide Web

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,710
was maturing in that time it was

00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:45,250
actually first started in 1989 so by

00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:48,190
1991 it was easier to get this access

00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:50,320
didn't have to do things like take two

00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,670
binary files have put them together and

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,320
decompressed them and things like that

00:37:51,670 --> 00:38:00,550
like you had to do with really decent

00:37:53,320 --> 00:38:05,620
porn and so in 1994 which was ten years

00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:08,800
after George Orwell's 1984 we had system

00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:12,550
vendors that were seeding the desktop to

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,320
Microsoft they were giving up and say

00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:16,660
we're not gonna have UNIX on the desktop

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,170
we're not gonna have VMs on the desktop

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:24,220
we're gonna have NT or we're gonna have

00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:27,370
Windows on the desktop and maybe and T

00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:29,110
as a server and a lot of these vendors

00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:32,050
are beginning to panic because they saw

00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:38,410
that Microsoft was going to eat their

00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:41,020
lunch even Tim O'Reilly has started to

00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:45,280
publish he had been publishing books on

00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:47,590
UNIX Unix commands how to use UNIX music

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,780
systems administration and all of a

00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:52,750
sudden he stopped publishing those and

00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:57,190
started publishing books on Windows and

00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:59,410
Windows NT now I don't blame him for

00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:03,220
doing that he had a company he had

00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:06,940
people working for him and you know he

00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:11,500
needed to keep them working but on the

00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:16,470
other hand he'd given up and then along

00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:19,630
came Linux and in May of 1994 version

00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:22,810
1.0 of the Linux was published and that

00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:25,840
was a signal for people to say I could

00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:29,560
start using this as a real operating

00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:32,560
system to do real work some

00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:35,830
distributions like Debian were announced

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:43,150
in 1993 two year before but the real

00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:44,320
distribution came out in 1994 soft

00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:47,740
landing systems

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:52,570
Yggdrasil those are systems that were

00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:56,440
announced and shipped into 93 but they

00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:59,640
didn't survive slack where did and

00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,640
debian did

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,580
now over the next few years the new

00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:10,090
Linux and I put into good news there to

00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:14,050
make Richard happier I know he'll never

00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:18,070
be happy just happier but it really

00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:20,800
should be after all good new MIT BSD and

00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:26,110
a whole bunch of other things that go

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:28,690
into the operating system Linux it still

00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:30,750
didn't have any applications it had to

00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:35,580
show utilities had a bunch of

00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:38,170
interesting stuff there but no real

00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,480
applications on top the people would

00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:44,170
recognize no office package or anything

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,740
like that however it was a lot cheaper

00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:51,150
than getting SPARC and Solaris for

00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:55,990
things like shell accounts for ISPs or

00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:59,200
to set up email and web servers or to

00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:02,200
set up a firewall way to set up a DNS

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,690
server and remember you now have all

00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,970
these old three these six machines that

00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:08,770
you want to repurpose you don't want

00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:10,620
just threw them out you don't want to

00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:13,300
use them as a doorstop you're

00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:15,550
repurposing these old machines to do

00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:22,050
work while the new machines you're

00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:26,410
buying or doing your real work in 1994

00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:27,760
we had a problem supercomputer companies

00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:31,390
were going out of business

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,460
ECL and Cray because it was spending

00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:36,550
millions of dollars to create a

00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:39,130
supercomputer to solve problems and then

00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:42,160
only five people would buy them and

00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:47,110
three of those people were universities

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:50,020
that never really paid any money so two

00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:52,810
people dr. Donna Donald Becker and dr.

00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:56,680
Tom Stirling created concept of the

00:41:52,810 --> 00:42:00,160
Beowulf using commodity off the self

00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,560
programs or as systems and put this

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:07,660
little operating system called Linux on

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:11,589
it and solve real-world problems like

00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:15,099
weather forecasting and hydrodynamic

00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:20,279
and other things and that created

00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:23,469
another market for Linux in 1998

00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:26,799
databases like Informix and Oracle

00:42:23,469 --> 00:42:28,839
started to port to Linux and for

00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:30,819
somebody who had worked at digital and

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:33,069
had gone through this process of

00:42:30,819 --> 00:42:36,219
bringing out a new operating system and

00:42:33,069 --> 00:42:39,009
architecture several times I recognized

00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:40,930
a pattern that was forming and his

00:42:39,009 --> 00:42:43,900
pattern was a pattern to becoming

00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:49,269
accepted as an operating system in

00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:51,880
business in the year 2000 embedded

00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:54,309
systems started to embrace Linux up

00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,650
until that point you had proprietary

00:42:54,309 --> 00:43:00,309
embedded systems like when vivir and

00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:03,880
stuff like that but then something

00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:06,339
magical happened these little embedded

00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,960
systems were expected to talk to each

00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:11,859
other and more importantly they were

00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,690
expected to talk to the Internet and

00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:17,200
when you do that you have to have

00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:20,890
something known as an IP stack a tcp/ip

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:24,130
stack and they are not easy to write and

00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:26,469
you need to make your system secure and

00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:30,549
you need to make your system efficient

00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:33,369
and this was going to take a lot of

00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:34,809
money and a lot of effort and all of a

00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:37,569
sudden they realized that there was this

00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:41,739
operating system that did all of that

00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:44,829
and guess what it was free and it was

00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:48,309
open and they said we're going to use

00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:51,579
Linux and almost overnight Linux became

00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:57,009
the most used operating system in new

00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:58,450
designs for embedded systems now I know

00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,910
that you're all sitting out there and

00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:03,519
saying this sounds wonderful and what we

00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:08,559
really want is the year of the UNIX

00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:12,940
desktop with a Linux desktop and that is

00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:16,210
a hard thing to do because for a long

00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:18,640
time there was only really one standard

00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:21,849
on the desktop it had been ceded to

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,339
Microsoft you had millions of people out

00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:26,079
there - did not really understand

00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:29,229
what they were doing when they ran the

00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:31,869
computer they had this tap Dantas

00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:34,420
notebook filled with little things they

00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:37,299
had written down pushed this button this

00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:39,549
thing appears do this that thing happens

00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:43,269
and if anything was different from that

00:44:39,549 --> 00:44:48,269
set they were lost my mother and father

00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:50,769
were these people and they would not

00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:52,599
learn anything else because what they

00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:55,809
were learning was button pushes and

00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:58,989
things like that however something else

00:44:55,809 --> 00:45:03,099
happened the World Wide Web that was

00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:05,200
started back in 1989 now has matured to

00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:08,519
the fact that it was now browsers

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,900
setting up a new is user interface and

00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:13,630
cell phones were setting up yet a

00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:17,380
different user interface and people had

00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:19,509
to learn how the scrollbar worked not

00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:22,299
just put your mouse here and drag it

00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:25,630
down and they had to understand what

00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:31,380
radio buttons do and they had to learn

00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:35,829
not one interface but many so that

00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:38,140
helped that a lot but not enough because

00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:40,150
the number one reason given as to why

00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:44,650
people didn't use Linux in her desktop

00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:46,599
was lack of games I have a slight

00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:48,099
problem with that I think of computers

00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:50,789
as something that I used to solve real

00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:55,019
problems and games are not one of them

00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:58,029
but I'm not the average user I guess and

00:45:55,019 --> 00:46:02,529
then people would say why only need 5

00:45:58,029 --> 00:46:05,109
applications to be able to use Linux but

00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:06,759
when you start asking around the first

00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:10,900
three applications are always the same

00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:13,710
office package Mail browser but then you

00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:16,839
get into the more different ones and

00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:19,450
finding that last and fifth application

00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:22,019
that everybody wants to use is often

00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,019
very hard

00:46:23,009 --> 00:46:28,630
another threat at the same time was

00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,989
Apple's upswing to turning computers

00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:35,950
from being data processing things into

00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:37,029
being consumer products the iPad it has

00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,940
two looks Lee

00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:44,279
it has to be great it has to be easy to

00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:47,710
use Apple systems are not easy to use

00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:50,819
but they are consistent and they are

00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:53,499
consistent across all of their products

00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:56,589
one of the things that Apple did in the

00:46:53,499 --> 00:47:00,160
very first days of Apple was to create a

00:46:56,589 --> 00:47:02,529
style guide that said this is how the

00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:06,460
operating system will look and this is

00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:08,559
how the things on it will work if you

00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:11,619
remember Apple brought out the Lisa

00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:14,499
computer it was a graphical computer and

00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:16,569
they said to all their third party

00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:20,979
people just port your code to it that's

00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:24,099
fine and it was a disaster but then they

00:47:20,979 --> 00:47:26,799
brought out the Macintosh and they said

00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:30,069
when you port your applications here you

00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:34,509
have to meet this style guide well you

00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:37,299
will not be a Macintosh application and

00:47:34,509 --> 00:47:40,660
people looked at it and he grumbled his

00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:43,329
stuff and the first Mac application came

00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:47,200
out and Apple looked at and say yes you

00:47:43,329 --> 00:47:50,140
get a nice big gold star and I said

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,259
what's the big deal but then the second

00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,700
Mac application came out and it looked

00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:57,479
like it was written by the same person

00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:03,099
and everybody went

00:47:57,479 --> 00:48:07,719
now they understood and so Apple turned

00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:12,789
a computer from a computing process into

00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:15,930
a consumer item now in the latest round

00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:18,999
with their iPad iPhone eye everything

00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:21,989
they were looking to really move to

00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:26,529
market again but one thing happened

00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:28,719
Android foiled them because as you know

00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:30,539
the only person that can do business

00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:33,519
with Apple is Apple

00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:35,469
you can only buy apple discs you can

00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,960
only buy Apple printers you can only buy

00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:39,670
Apple monitors sure you can get other

00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,039
things but they don't necessarily work

00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:45,729
with Apple you go to the Apple store you

00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:47,440
have the Apple Genius helping you but

00:48:45,729 --> 00:48:49,130
what if you would have make money and

00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,180
your name is an apple

00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:56,340
then you use Android and the same

00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:59,760
statistics will end up in them in the

00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:03,780
future where Apple will probably have 7%

00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,560
of a very profitable market which would

00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:09,120
make their stockholders very happy and

00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:16,820
Android and other operating systems will

00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:20,340
have the other 93% now we have the cloud

00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:22,770
everybody loves the cloud where we hide

00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:25,350
the operating system and the libraries

00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:28,170
and utilities away from the customer so

00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:29,610
they don't know what's going on they

00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:32,520
don't know where they've stored their

00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:35,310
data we give them the illusion of

00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:39,180
privacy and security but we don't tell

00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:41,610
them about the NSA and what we need to

00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:46,140
do is give to cloud back to the people

00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:49,920
as I said I am the chief executive

00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:51,900
officer of opted-in and we produce super

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:56,370
Thai open source peer-to-peer cloud

00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:57,990
software it allows you to take your

00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:00,900
resources you have your computer

00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:03,660
resources combine them in a better

00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:06,060
format to be more efficient and to be

00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:09,450
able to buy and sell or barter your

00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:11,460
computer resources to other people but

00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:13,950
from my viewpoint it's even more

00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:16,260
important that with this you can

00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:20,100
actually keep your data away from the

00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:23,910
NSA and from other people who want to

00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:26,460
spy on you it's not just buying by the

00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:28,950
United States government it's spying by

00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:33,240
people that want to sell you things and

00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:37,350
want to know what your psyche is we have

00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:39,630
a hardware a router we call it the

00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:42,690
blockchain router it's a broadband

00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:47,880
router but it also provides nice bass

00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:51,210
Nass back trade it could be an IOT

00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,760
gateway supporting Arduino shields and

00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:56,610
Raspberry Pi GPIO pins which we have

00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:59,040
built into our system but most

00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:01,080
importantly it allows you to be energy

00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:05,460
efficient in your blockchain

00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:08,670
mining so you could mine etherium tokens

00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:12,450
of different types utilizing the router

00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:14,580
and it only draws 18 watts of power to

00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:16,620
do all of that that's about the same

00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:19,980
amount of power that your Linksys we

00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:22,640
were dealing Crowder's use it is an open

00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:25,700
design the design is up on github but

00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,020
it's going to be built in Brazil

00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:31,260
utilizing Brazilian parts for the most

00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:33,480
part as part of a project called caninus

00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,300
lucas and we'll hear more about that in

00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:38,220
a few minutes

00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:41,340
our company is led by three open-source

00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:43,440
advocates alex karras ulu who has worked

00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,330
for the Apache foundation for a very

00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,530
long time and has written a lot of the

00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:51,900
very difficult code in Apache Sally Kara

00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:54,300
duty ku dari who is a director of

00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:56,370
marketing and she's been the marketing

00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:59,130
person for the Apache foundation and

00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:04,710
other open source projects and myself as

00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:09,240
CEO now here are some shameless plugs of

00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:11,610
things that might affect Debian a lot we

00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:14,100
have here in Brazil headed up at the

00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:20,040
University of Sao Paulo a project called

00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:23,310
caninus Lucas about five years ago when

00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:26,610
the Raspberry Pi came out I invited the

00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:30,690
Raspberry Pi people to come to Brazil to

00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:33,210
attend campus party to show them how

00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:37,140
enthusiastic and how knowledgeable the

00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:40,250
Brazilian people were I begged them to

00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:43,110
produce the Raspberry Pi in Brazil

00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:46,980
because as you know the Raspberry Pi

00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:48,690
that cost $35 in the United States is

00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:53,040
currently selling for about two hundred

00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:57,750
highs here in Brazil mostly due to taxes

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,790
and that makes it too expensive for high

00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:01,980
school students or university students

00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:05,730
to use it the same way it's used in the

00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:09,210
United States and Great Britain after

00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:11,940
two years of working with them they said

00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:13,170
no we're not going to do it they didn't

00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:17,050
tell me why

00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:21,030
so I went out to a Chinese vendor called

00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:24,100
the maker and I got them to agree to

00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:27,370
license their design to us and then we

00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:29,770
would manufacture it in Brazil it has

00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:37,180
taken three years to get through all of

00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:39,220
the logistics taxes everything else but

00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,540
we now in the next month or two are

00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:43,990
going to be producing this in

00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:46,750
high-volume we produce a better system

00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:49,390
than the Raspberry Pi with twice as much

00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:53,950
memory two to three times faster in

00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:57,550
benchmarks USB 3.0 instead of USB 2.0 as

00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:59,500
a bus it works in higher temperature 70

00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:03,250
degrees Celsius instead of 40 degrees

00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:06,970
Celsius and it is also better with

00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:11,350
electrostatic discharge and it will cost

00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:16,390
five dollars more than the $35 raspberry

00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:18,850
pie now professor zu foe who is the head

00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:20,950
of this project went to the Brazilian

00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:22,860
government who is working on the

00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:26,020
internet of things planned for Brazil

00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:28,270
they're investing 10 billion the

00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:30,580
equivalent of 10 billion US dollars in

00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:35,860
the program and they expect to get about

00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:38,890
200 billion US dollars out of it they

00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:41,320
wanted these professor to generate the

00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:43,840
hardware platform for the entire

00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:47,650
Internet of Things program for all of

00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:49,750
Brazil and he has decided that he's

00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:53,470
going to generate three different parts

00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:57,340
one of them he calls the flea it's a

00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:58,510
tiny little sensor computer and that

00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,820
little computer will have a lot of

00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:05,230
sensors on it he'll be able to run off

00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:09,340
of batteries for several years and it'll

00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:11,440
be very very inexpensive the Labrador is

00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:15,640
the Machine I just described

00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:18,160
it's a Raspberry Pi on steroids and then

00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:21,790
the super toy blockchain router has been

00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:24,500
donated to the platform so they can use

00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:27,620
that as the I end

00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:29,450
and he needs help in putting Debian

00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:34,520
which is going to be the selected

00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:37,210
platform on all these systems onto this

00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:40,010
Internet of Things set of platforms and

00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:42,470
so he's asked me to come here and reach

00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:46,750
out to you and say if there's people

00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:49,180
that are interested in joining this and

00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:52,040
helping out with this here in Brazil

00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:55,700
because all of these systems will be

00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:58,940
manufactured in Brazil by Brazilians

00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:01,640
and this is going to create a center of

00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:04,420
expertise here in Brazil that can be

00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:07,700
used in other electronics projects

00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:10,520
instead of having well-trained people go

00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:12,290
to the United States go to China go to

00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,140
Europe because that's where the

00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:20,270
interesting projects are we're going to

00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:22,850
create them here in Brazil and then

00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:25,460
tsumetai has decided to use Debian as

00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:28,330
our main platform for distribution of

00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,330
our software

00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:35,800
so in summary UNIX was important because

00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:38,840
for the first time

00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:41,420
human beings were thought of being more

00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:45,590
expensive and more worthwhile than the

00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:48,980
machine cycles that maintaining your

00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:50,960
investment in human beings and be able

00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:53,570
to use that same investment across all

00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:57,590
the pieces of hardware all the scaling

00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:59,600
points was more important than being a

00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:04,040
little bit more efficient in your use of

00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:06,550
them it's set in a lot of ways the API

00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:13,400
is for the future of a wide variety of

00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:17,600
systems today Linux runs on 60% of all

00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:19,520
the servers being shipped it is the most

00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,770
used operating system and embedded

00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:29,900
system design it is a is a core of

00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:32,930
Android it is the is used on all 500 of

00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:35,300
the fastest computers in the world there

00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:37,789
used to be to the ran Microsoft because

00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:45,140
Microsoft paid them to

00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:49,049
but even they gave up and your gnu/linux

00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:53,910
has real it the desire of people to have

00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:56,910
control over their software you know we

00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:59,130
talk about software freedom but there's

00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:01,500
a lot of people out there do not they do

00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:05,339
not understand what the word freedom

00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:08,789
means certainly Donald Trump doesn't

00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:10,950
seem to know that so I have stopped

00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:14,390
talking about software freedom and

00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:18,210
instead I talk about software slavery

00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:21,779
because people understand slavery better

00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:23,819
than they understand freedom when you're

00:58:21,779 --> 00:58:26,549
a slave you're told where to go what to

00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:28,980
do when to have children who to marry

00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:33,990
you're not allowed to have property it

00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:36,210
all belongs to the master when you are

00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:37,920
software slave you told when to install

00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:42,359
the system how many people can run on it

00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:45,769
what systems that get run on and when

00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:48,630
you can't use your hardware anymore and

00:58:45,769 --> 00:58:52,950
the control is taken away from you and

00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:57,029
is put back in the vendor I like new

00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:59,069
software freedom and free and

00:58:57,029 --> 00:59:02,009
open-source software and hardware and

00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:05,160
free culture have set it forth another

00:59:02,009 --> 00:59:08,940
version of capitalism do not let people

00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:14,809
say the free software is communism it is

00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:19,319
not communism it is co-operativism and

00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:23,700
in co-operativism people work for a

00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:26,579
common good there is many forms of

00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:30,779
capitalism Donald Trump only thinks of

00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:33,809
one so here is another shameless plug

00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:38,390
this is the last one really it's a

00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:43,279
series of things because next year 2019

00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:47,970
will be 25 years or quarter century of

00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:50,240
Linux as version 1.0 or before it is the

00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:53,660
anniversary of the creation of the

00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:56,420
of supercomputers and it is decree the

00:59:53,660 --> 01:00:00,830
anniversary of most major distributions

00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:04,190
starting up next year will be 30 years

01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:06,470
at the World Wide Web and 30 years I've

01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:10,330
had the UNIX license plate on my car

01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:10,330
that says live free or die

01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:19,430
also in 2019 is one half century of the

01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:22,790
people walking on the moon UNIX the

01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:26,560
internet leanest Torvalds being born my

01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:32,020
programming and the last time I shaved

01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:33,230
but last the next year is also Deb coffe

01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:38,630
Curitiba

01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:40,070
so let's party thank you very much if

01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:46,369
you'd like to ask some questions I'd be

01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:47,180
happy to answer them there's a question

01:00:46,369 --> 01:00:51,770
in the back

01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:54,050
that lady by the way I'd like to say I

01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:56,810
was very happy to see the Debian women

01:00:54,050 --> 01:01:00,290
up here because two of my favorite

01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:03,710
people of all time Ada Lovelace the

01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:05,960
first programmer and rear admiral grace

01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:07,460
Murray hopper the first modern-day

01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:12,380
programmer yes ma'am

01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:14,960
I would like to just a question about

01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:20,180
how can we get involved about getting

01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:22,310
Debian and the Labrador board so I'm

01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:24,500
sorry what is the question how can we

01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:27,440
get involved with the Labrador project

01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:30,320
that you mentioned the project that we

01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,790
that are going to be manufacture the

01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,940
board that are going to manufacture here

01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:38,000
result that board is being manufactured

01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:41,450
by a branch of the University of Sao

01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:48,109
Paulo called la Cite Tech and if you go

01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:51,170
to WWE news lucas org genious lucas of

01:01:48,109 --> 01:01:52,910
course is crazy canines all of our

01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:56,330
boards are deigned after different dogs

01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:59,140
I'm the mad dog and the professor is I

01:01:56,330 --> 01:02:03,130
don't know what he calls himself but

01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:05,290
there you can see more about the project

01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:07,690
and if you can't find the information

01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:11,350
about how to get involved then you can

01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:15,670
send me email at mad dog at Li dot org

01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:18,220
and I will look for it what I would like

01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:22,450
to do is see maybe this debian group

01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:25,120
here form a sub group that would be

01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:27,790
interested in helping with this IOT

01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:30,790
platform and that might make it easier

01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:33,070
to set up a mailing list and stuff and

01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:34,770
figure out for yourselves the ways that

01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:37,600
you would like to help with the project

01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:40,720
we need people to write device drivers

01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:43,930
we need people to help us create

01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:46,000
distributions I've always haven't been

01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:48,340
happy with the Raspberry Pi people where

01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:53,170
they created the raspbian distribution

01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:55,330
I want Debian to write or not you know

01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:58,240
dot court raspbian or anything like I

01:02:55,330 --> 01:03:00,760
want it to be Debian for ARM

01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:03,010
architecture running on that or any

01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,920
other architecture it happens to be fit

01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:07,360
into the Kaneda Salukis project we're

01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,780
actually looking at the RISC 5

01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:14,560
architecture for the flea because of the

01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:18,760
heavy intellectual property costs of

01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:20,500
using arm so you may have a sub

01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:24,940
experience then and working with the VIS

01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:27,510
5 architecture in the future another

01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:27,510
question

01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:45,020
thank you very much for listening

01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:45,020
