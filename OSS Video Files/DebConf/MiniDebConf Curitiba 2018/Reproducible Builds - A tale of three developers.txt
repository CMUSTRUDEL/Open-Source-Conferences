A status report on Reproducible builds, which enable everyone to verify that a
given binary is made from the source it is claimed to be made from, by
enabling anyone to create bit by bit identical binaries.

This talk will report on the state of reproducible builds in various
distributions, though the focus will be on Debian. Holger will explain how he
started working on this in the Debian context and how his focus shifted
slightly over the time. So he will start with explaining the status of
Reproducible Debian, but this is quickly followed by an overview of common
problems and solutions, followed by a quick explaination of the shared test
infrastructure for reproducible tests of any project. You will learn how the
community was broadened, what future plans we have to address what might be
needed beyond being able to reproducible build something, so this becomes
truly meaningful for users in practice.

We hope to have achieved this last bit for the Buster release. Stay tuned!
