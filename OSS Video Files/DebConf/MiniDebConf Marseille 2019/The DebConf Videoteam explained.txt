Lurking behind cameras and playing with strange mixing consoles, the DebConf Videoteam labors in the shadows, trying to record and stream all the Debian-related conferences.
In this talk, Nicolas and Louis-Philippe will shine some light on the Videoteam setup and share some of the technical challenges the team has experienced in the past.

	00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:10,820
great hi hi my name is Foyle I'm Nicola

00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,420
and we're gonna talk about a def con

00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:18,619
video team so all the wonders of how to

00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:21,320
set up things how our deal works all the

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,270
funny bits you've missed because you

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,670
weren't there

00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,590
midnight last night all these kind of

00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,619
things are great working in the video

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,840
team

00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:35,210
what's the video team with the Uniting

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,050
people that tell you to set up and wait

00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:43,310
for microphone so what we do is we

00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:45,410
record the events of the Debian

00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,079
community and we record all the

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,510
conference presentations we allow

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,730
through streaming the participation of

00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,309
people who couldn't come to the event so

00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:58,700
we all have remote participation and we

00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:01,360
try to have tons of fun working towards

00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,990
a free free software and hardware

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,969
conferencing video stack yeah we're like

00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:11,929
90% there yeah pretty much

00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:15,859
so the DEF CON video team has lots and

00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:17,840
lots and lots of people the people on

00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:21,439
this slide are kind of the core of the

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:26,450
video team members some of them are here

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,549
some of them aren't but the video team

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,759
wouldn't be able to work without the

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:36,289
dozens and dozens of volunteers that

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:39,609
help us at conferences so thanks to

00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:43,209
everyone who helps with the video stuff

00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:46,189
and also thanks to the sponsors because

00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:48,609
the recordings that we do the hardware

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:51,799
that we buy the resources that we use

00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:54,590
wouldn't be here without Debian sponsors

00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:57,200
so thanks a lot to all the sponsors of

00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,590
the view and to deepen for buying all

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,450
the stuff

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:05,659
yeah sure that you want to do yeah sure

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,500
so this time overview the microphone is

00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:11,930
dropping yeah anyway see fun with the

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,460
video stuff so it assists I'm over the

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,080
arch system is quite complicated and we

00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:20,340
normally

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:23,670
divided between audio and video but if

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,040
you can see here in the projector

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,700
[Music]

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,370
basically our audio is all geared with

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,650
the mixer that is in the back of the

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,739
room here we have multiple microphones

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:42,090
we have four microphones in total so

00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:43,799
that is two that's two headsets and then

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:50,609
two hand microphones that are all

00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:54,510
wireless so it's a bunch of cables going

00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:56,069
all through the for this and then

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,280
there's a video we have two cameras per

00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:01,590
room so often sees like Deb Kampf

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,989
what we normally do is we have multiple

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,370
rooms so in a single room like this

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:12,269
we're going to have two cameras the

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:15,030
first one is gonna use the microphone

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:20,069
that works so the first the first camera

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:23,340
I find what the video team so the the

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,480
first camera the first camera is to

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,549
record a present data and then the

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,340
second one gives us a second shot and

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:31,139
the audience for questions it's all it

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,810
also allows for more dynamic

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,760
recording of people talking so you don't

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,230
only have one on camera taking things

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,299
and these cameras are both wired to

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,340
video mixing console so it's a PC

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,160
basically we have to capture cards that

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,090
I used for capturing the video and we

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,340
also capture the presenters laptop so if

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,370
you see the podium here I have a HDMI

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,690
cable that goes out from my laptop and

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:03,930
through a mess of cables and equipment

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:07,109
this goes to a box that converts the

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:11,669
signal and allows us to get it on stream

00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:16,320
as well I think that's very much what we

00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:18,180
have for overview so yeah so a close-up

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,070
of the video recording equipment that's

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:27,270
one of our cameras so we got decent very

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,789
decent camcorders we got them in 2017 so

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,400
we have six camcorders which allows us

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:37,800
to record three rooms with a consistent

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:43,260
setup and their 4k SDI output as

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:48,090
recording camcorders we only use the

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,550
digital output that goes that fits the

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,039
capture PC you know we own the cameras

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,680
are 4k ready but we don't record in 4k

00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:59,190
for technical reasons the footage is

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,990
really really large and our mixing PC

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,060
couldn't handle it so we're recording in

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,150
720p for the moment yeah I think that's

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,610
been quite a lot of improvements on the

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:12,150
software stack I know for instance that

00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:15,870
we see records infrared did you know so

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:20,820
yeah but like 720p for conference video

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:24,840
is pretty good at least we consider it

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:28,080
pretty good we also have two tripods so

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,349
the two tripods allow us to have like a

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,240
full set of hardware to record mini-cons

00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:38,610
when we need more when we want to recall

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:41,460
free rooms we hire some hardware we have

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:45,719
satellites so terry rights allow the

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,729
camera operators to see that the camera

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:50,849
is on stream so there's a light that

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:56,070
goes on when the camera is enabled

00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:59,930
they're basically like it's just an LED

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:05,880
that gets activated by the DTR line on

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:09,900
an rs-232 connection so we can extend

00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:13,440
the run for very long with just a few

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,740
rj45 adapters so we have kept five

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:22,159
Ethernet port cable that runs all the

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:25,349
way for the world for the audio we have

00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:30,690
so we've renewed the equipment for the

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:34,050
audio setup this year we got a new

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,100
mixing desk with more inputs than what

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,650
we had

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:44,250
we have also new microphones and

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:48,480
receivers so basically it's so thanks to

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:53,040
Freedom House for sponsoring us the

00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:56,480
mixing desk and Debian gave us the rest

00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,580
of the audio equipment so as we said two

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:04,040
headsets two handheld microphones and

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:06,540
four receivers for all of that sadly

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,450
these receivers have certain frequency

00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:13,290
and they're not we couldn't take it for

00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:15,810
example and bring it to us or because

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,910
certain countries in the world have laws

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,410
and radio frequency so these receivers

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,660
are blocked first and in frequency and

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:24,390
they all changed depending on different

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:28,260
countries so we decide on this one this

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:30,810
setup because most mini comms are in

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,430
Europe so this works for the greater

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,610
group and these kind of things but if we

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,530
went to the US or like in in Asia mmm

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,970
for a mini conference which we would

00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:43,890
have to hire some more gear for that

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:48,990
yeah why or less regulations around the

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:52,560
world our pain in the ass and so we've

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:57,600
put most of the your recording gear

00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:00,060
inside a flight case them take so we can

00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,910
just roll around and it's pretty much

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:06,840
all in one place we used to have like a

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:09,150
Pied of a pied of smaller flight cases

00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,420
it was quite a mess to ship everything

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:15,300
around its I think we've streamlined to

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:19,740
four packages and two tripods which is

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:22,680
kind of it's okay it's a it's manageable

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,930
so the way we capture the present-day

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:32,040
ters laptop is through a project called

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:35,040
AG my two USB yeah and it uses I don't

00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,229
know how it works and then it uses a

00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:42,330
board called a numero OPS's which is

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:46,650
open hardware and and it has yeah yeah

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:48,700
it is yeah and it has a FPGA inside so

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,490
the HDMI to USB

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,590
is a project we flash on it and what it

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,070
does it has two inputs and two outputs

00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,510
for HDMI so you could even put to two

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,750
different inputs and then use the

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:04,000
outputs and it has USB output afterwards

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,760
and we take this USB output and put it

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,890
in the in the recording PC so it gives

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,190
us basically a way to capture what the

00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:14,140
presentator has and we need multiple

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,500
outputs because one of the output is

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:21,430
going to to the projector in the room so

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,710
we are using this matrix board to be

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,300
able to record so it's free it's really

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,920
nice because we have one output going to

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,200
the projector and we had what output

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,960
going to screen in front we can look at

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,450
the screen in front kind of peek at the

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,490
audience rather than turning around like

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:40,050
I've been doing for the start of the

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,710
talk so I'm gonna try to actually stay

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,360
this project

00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,800
I mean we're we've been using that

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,530
project for a while and at the beginning

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,590
it wasn't the most stable project but

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:52,510
it's it's very good it's really improved

00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,180
and nowadays we basically know and we

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,610
have any problems with it and it's a

00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,880
really solid project yeah it comes up

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:04,090
sort of faucets do you mind USB yeah and

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,660
so this so basically this device

00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:11,230
presents a webcam over USB and so we

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,900
have a SBC or a single board computer

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:17,200
plugged into it it's a me know about

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:20,890
turbot so it's I think it's an Intel

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:26,740
Atom based system fanless pretty nice

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:30,160
tiny it all fits in when you is so this

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,560
large case I think I have a picture of

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,470
the case of the inside of the case and

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,930
it's like one board one tiny board and

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,840
then lots of space like we had space to

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:45,610
put a switch and lots of stuff inside so

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,620
it's kind of tiny it's it's nice for the

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:52,620
live recording for the live mixing of

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:56,020
the presentations we use a desktop PC

00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:59,360
basically this desktop PC is connected

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:03,170
for the network with the

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:07,840
presenter slide capture PC and it's

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:12,770
connected with SDI to the two cameras

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:16,580
it needs of the big CPU we've managed to

00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:20,380
make the system work with lower end

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:23,690
high fives I think last year in Taiwan

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:26,390
it wasn't great we had to like shrink

00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,870
down the previews and stuff to keep the

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:32,150
CPU use okay but with this machine we

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,780
can have fruit size views it's it's

00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,400
pretty nice

00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:38,630
the raw bandwidth needed for multiple

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,840
streams coming from the cameras is quite

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,070
high so to mix these then we're live

00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,700
make sure it takes quite a lot of

00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:49,340
resources and so this this computer is

00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,560
also used as a net gateway so that all

00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,500
the computers that are on the video

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:58,190
network can access the internet through

00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:01,880
any kind of app link that the venue

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:04,550
might provide so for instance here the

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,080
uplink is a very long cable run that

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,480
goes to a switch that goes to another

00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,610
room through a window it's it's a bit

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,520
messy but we only need one Network drop

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:16,940
and then we are self-sufficient on the

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,100
network so we can kind of make do with

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:24,680
any situation that when you can throw at

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:26,420
us and for the live mixing software

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,420
we're using we're using something called

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:33,650
auto mix it was written by the the folks

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:36,170
at the CCC so ccc vo c team it's great

00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:40,730
it's it's built in Python it's all in

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:43,100
Debian what to say so when you look at

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,980
the when you get the mixing software

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,500
which is this window on the left you

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,050
have the two camera inputs and a slide a

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:56,210
slideshow input and then you have a

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:59,030
preview of the life mixed version so

00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:03,830
this is the GUI for the desktop that we

00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:06,260
use over there and here you we put a few

00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,920
previews of the actual stream so we can

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:13,149
make sure that we see that we actually

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:16,779
stream stuff and we've also

00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:20,319
so we have we communicate on IRC the

00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:24,219
team communicates on IRC and so the the

00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:28,659
director has a window open on IRC so you

00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:31,079
can so they can get feedback from either

00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:34,029
the audience or camera operators or

00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:38,019
anyone else that might have something

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:41,019
interesting to say for instance here

00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:44,409
people are talking about the scheduling

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:46,809
for the next session so yes this window

00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:49,449
and on the bottom left here is just a

00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:52,989
view of the recordings so we can sure

00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:57,609
that the recordings are enabled and keep

00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:59,739
like recording I personally lost half a

00:13:57,609 --> 00:14:03,249
day of recordings because there was no

00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:04,779
recording we've added that since it's

00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:06,939
always a good thing to check that you're

00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:09,219
actually recording something yeah so

00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:12,459
yeah vector mix all packaged in debian

00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:16,239
thanks to the c free VLC for pinning it

00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:22,499
it's great live streaming I guess that's

00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:27,939
my area of expertise as basic this

00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:31,089
mixing software outputs a raw video feed

00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:34,929
that we need to put somewhere pushed

00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:39,419
somewhere so what we do is in every room

00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:45,699
we have so this mixing PC is pushing

00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:48,999
using rtmp so we encode in x26 h.264 and

00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:52,959
AAC the field and we push it through

00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:58,059
rtmp to a streaming back-end which uses

00:14:52,959 --> 00:15:00,449
nginx with the rtmp module rtmp is the

00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:06,339
like industry standard for pushing

00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:10,779
real-time audio and video feeds and the

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:14,139
rtmp module basically slices the video

00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:18,669
and put it into the HTTP Live Streaming

00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:22,240
format or HLS which is standard ish

00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:25,449
thing that was developed by Apple

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,399
originally and then I became the

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:31,480
industry standard for streaming on the

00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:36,730
web so what the HLS format is is

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:40,119
basically a playlist of chunks of video

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:43,420
and audio that you that you have to put

00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:46,480
in a HTTP directory so for the client

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:51,279
you just have to do HTTP requests on a

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:55,869
loop to the playlist and open the slices

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:58,749
one by one and play that what we have

00:15:55,869 --> 00:16:01,209
for the front-end is basically HTTP

00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:04,179
caching we don't need anything more than

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:06,879
just a HTTP cache because it's just a

00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:10,329
plain directory so it's it's really easy

00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:14,709
to actually distribute front ends around

00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:22,480
the globe to reduce the latency for the

00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:24,819
player so we we do nice stuff like down

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,160
scaling the stream so basically the

00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:30,879
central streaming back-end also runs

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:35,049
ffmpeg on the incoming stream to lower

00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:36,730
the so it creates down scaled versions

00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:39,879
with lower quality lower bandwidth

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:44,740
requirements and HLS allows you to have

00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:47,199
adaptive streaming so you can adapt the

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,660
clients can adapt the files that it's

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,360
going to get according to the bandwidth

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:57,220
that it actually has so this allows

00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:02,759
streaming all around the world even for

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:06,279
low bandwidth like remote attendees it's

00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,360
it's worked I think somewhat better than

00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:12,539
what we had before

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,539
we used to use I cast - yeah ice cast

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:23,500
was the protocol yeah I see the lights

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:26,620
blinking which is right anyway so nginx

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,289
rtmp module it's packaged in Debian it's

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,760
in the stable back ports and it's going

00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:33,750
to be in the in the next release as well

00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,500
so pretty cool first

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:40,440
actually is really happy that we package

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,419
nginx rtmp module because they need they

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,750
used it but they had to package it

00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,190
themselves so we actually collaborated

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,039
with them to make sure that it was

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,020
included inside the Debian nginx package

00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:57,000
so first them actually uses these

00:17:52,020 --> 00:18:00,780
packages that's Rico so yeah a big

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,580
distribution with so we don't use geo

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:08,419
DNS we use geoip on the server side so

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,980
basically when you connect to the server

00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:14,909
it can redirect you to the appropriate

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:17,909
front end usually in media pumps we only

00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:20,669
have one front end because does like a

00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:23,549
smaller audience then there is at depth

00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:26,840
conf and there's a lower set up time so

00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:31,289
we don't do the whole shebang of having

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,230
20 front ends and everything it works

00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:36,059
okay the front end is just like

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,669
something fancy

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,440
I think first emery did you really uses

00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:43,919
their front ends because they have a lot

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:47,400
of remote attendants it's less of an

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,909
issue for us so we have direct access to

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,610
the DNS zone thanks to our friends at

00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:55,590
ESA so we can just push our changes and

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,679
we are autonomous on battery as well

00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:01,620
which is nice

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,270
so once the video have been recorded one

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,539
thing we do afterwards is to review them

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,520
before publication so the system we're

00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:10,860
using is called s review it's been

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,799
written by Valtor which is a member of

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:17,130
the video team it's also in Debian so

00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,400
basically s review managers preview

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:22,289
generation you can start you can you can

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,150
manage the start and the end of the

00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:26,730
video so for example if we started late

00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:29,220
then we're going to need to adjust when

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,250
exactly start the talk started and then

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,299
when it ended and then it cuts the video

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:38,970
at transcoded and it archives it for us

00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:41,370
it also we import the schedules of all

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,110
the conferences we're going to in s

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,230
review and then s review manages made of

00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:47,059
data so we can have some metadata

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,970
the words for the videos it's useful for

00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:51,799
example we're going to talk about it

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,690
later but we're uploading also videos to

00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:56,389
YouTube for example so that gives us

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,789
some some dates and metadata to have to

00:19:56,389 --> 00:20:01,580
upload there this system is also used by

00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:04,100
FOSDEM and the idea behind it is for it

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:07,639
to be as easy as possible to review

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,799
talks for example FOSDEM what they do is

00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,990
that they ask the present tears to I

00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,730
should review the talks themselves we do

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:17,080
with ourselves too because we have a

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:20,899
large team of volunteers to do it yeah

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:23,269
so the talks are recorded the transcoded

00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:26,480
where do we put them so we have a

00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:30,320
meetings archive it's so the main

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,730
meetings archive is FTP server so

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,730
basically it's a bunch of files on an

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,679
FTP server which is forget an extra pool

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,320
but sometimes we don't update the

00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,570
metadata well whatever

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,460
so there's a mix and match of fights

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:47,630
their videos their subtitles their

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:53,059
slides so over the past few years we've

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:56,059
tried to fix this mess and have a new

00:20:53,059 --> 00:21:00,559
git repository with metadata for all the

00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:03,919
files that are in the archive so this

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,549
repository and is these tools they scan

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,230
the metadata that's provided by the

00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:11,870
conferences so if there's a if there's a

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,029
schedule that's been written in magic

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:19,039
machine readable format then it can scan

00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:22,070
that and ingest the metadata and this

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,769
metadata can be used to build proper

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:29,409
front end for the DEF CON video archive

00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:32,870
so we've had people looking at peer tube

00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:38,870
staff here has built a Kodi plugin for

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:41,090
it as well so yeah it it's it's a work

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,889
in progress actually will have a really

00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,690
nice front end a fancy front end with

00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:51,350
all our videos if you're really good

00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:53,110
with web stuff the next thing that we do

00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:57,890
is that we've come to the conclusion

00:21:53,110 --> 00:22:01,430
that whatever you do whatever you say

00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:03,340
we'll upload your videos to YouTube so

00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,780
we might as well do it ourselves

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,290
properly with high quality videos that

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:13,460
we control if good metadata and making

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:17,330
sure that we have like proper YouTube

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:19,190
channel for our videos unfortunately

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:23,750
that's where a lot of the viewership is

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:25,250
so well we might as well so this is this

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,970
was kind of the first user of the

00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:32,450
metadata repository we have a new pile

00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:35,210
of scripts that generates and upload the

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,970
videos to YouTube from the metadata

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,280
repository so you can have a look at our

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,270
channel if you you should do YouTube one

00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,710
of the things that are great with

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:45,260
YouTube is that it automatically

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,330
generates closed captions yeah so it's

00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,970
the thing we try to do but it's it takes

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:52,460
a lot of time and effort to do so most

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,860
of the time it's ok yeah I mean the

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,020
manual manually done captions are way

00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:01,070
better than the automated stuff but the

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:03,260
automated stuff costs zero so it's a

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,880
it's a compromise and it is it's

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,070
sometimes funny because it has trouble

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,440
recognizing like different language so

00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,150
sometimes for example somebody speaking

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,430
with in English with a German accent

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:15,130
then ill subtitles everything in German

00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:18,920
while the person is speaking in English

00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:23,960
it's very fun machine learning right the

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:27,920
future a set up is done entirely through

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:30,340
and so we try to automate all the setup

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,470
that we do it serves two purposes it

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,480
allows us to have a rich repeatable set

00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,840
up and it allows us to document the

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,570
setup and show what kind of crazy hacks

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,440
we had to do to make things works so

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:47,780
basically we have two layers of

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:51,080
automatic setup we have a pixie server

00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:54,140
which we use for Debian installer

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,300
proceeding so this is just a stub of

00:23:54,140 --> 00:24:00,410
configuration to be able to start

00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,600
running ansible on the stone so we have

00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:06,200
a full repository with unstable

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,670
playbooks rules tasks the whole shebang

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,730
on

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:13,040
get it so for example when we need to

00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,020
set up for a big conference where we

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,760
have multiple machines the first step is

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,400
going to be building the PC server and

00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,830
then we can boot machines from there one

00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,720
afterward the other specifying an IP

00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,040
address and it will build automatically

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,500
the machines depending on the different

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,410
roles we have and the set up of the PC

00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,720
server is scripted as well we like we

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,170
can just read script it creates a USB

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,780
installer'

00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,040
so it makes very easy install for a

00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,630
bunch of different machines with

00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,000
different types of roles and different

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,250
capabilities and it works pretty well

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,700
yep it's alright so everything is

00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:48,980
documented in any part repository can go

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,730
and visit its video dub dub deb

00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:55,810
comforter org it's all bed with Sphinx

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:58,880
which is the same let's read the docs

00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:01,730
also what this website has a live player

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,080
for the mini dev comes so for different

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,740
conferences where people don't want to

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,730
be a whole website for the mini Kampf

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:11,570
people can just go there and watch a

00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:14,810
live stream directly we have two

00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:17,840
separate documentation pages one one for

00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:20,810
the actual ansible documentation so and

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,630
then one for our general setup and like

00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:25,070
what the hardware we use some diagrams

00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,200
and these kind of things so we have

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,900
manual documentation and unseeable

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:35,600
specific documentation basically into

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:39,770
two separate websites so this is a large

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:42,230
mess and so there's a lot of changes to

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,840
making it work and we've kind of picked

00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:47,750
up a few lessons along the way

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,340
so yeah ansible is great but having a

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,310
loose team of ten people work in an

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:55,370
instable when we meet like five six

00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:58,220
times a year it's kind of hard and one

00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:01,070
of the things we we did to make that

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:05,410
easier is to start using salsa so get

00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:08,540
the github repository of debian and

00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:11,000
using a merge request based workflow so

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,700
it's really it's way better so we we now

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,010
create merge request ask somebody to

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,650
review them say if it's okay whereas

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,680
when we were using Ally F we were just

00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,460
pushing

00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,870
master and then expecting things to work

00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:29,730
we're also using continuous integration

00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:34,410
so we have a different sets of tests

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:36,720
running through github CI on salsa we're

00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,610
using the darker executors and we're

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,410
using ansible lint first tool in the

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,120
code to see if we made some stupid

00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:44,700
mistakes or if something is going to be

00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,670
deprecated in ansible because things

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:51,330
tend to change and then each test each

00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:55,260
role is tested individually to see if it

00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:57,630
works and sadly one of the big problems

00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,780
we have is that system D and docker and

00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:03,570
get lab CI is not really it doesn't work

00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:06,270
there's no way to make it work at least

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,040
from what I know I worked like a bunch

00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,620
of time on this so we just kept the

00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:13,470
system new tasks and expect them to work

00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:17,550
so I messed up this image should be on

00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:21,540
the previous slide this shows in a very

00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:24,750
very thin and very gray on gray font the

00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,910
actual rules that we are testing so yeah

00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:30,930
there's a bunch of stuff that we test

00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:32,700
it's it's pretty nice so one of the big

00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,250
issues that we have is that we have a

00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,820
lot of specific custom hardware it's

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:44,310
really hard to emulate it and even then

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:46,380
it's also not that easy to have like for

00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:49,370
instance if we want to test the video

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:53,280
mixing software it's hard to have that

00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:56,430
sure sources that allow us to do an

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,980
integration test of our system so we

00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:02,760
haven't really found a good way to do to

00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,850
do that yet some people have starting

00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,360
play started playing with like

00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:11,310
automating setup of KVM machines to

00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:15,810
actually replicate the network setup and

00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:17,580
some of the injection stuff it's again

00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:21,480
if you want to sound like a fun

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:25,010
challenge with a complicated setup might

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,480
be something you can help us with

00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:30,180
documentation is a challenge it's a

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,040
technical challenge because well as

00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,470
you've as you've seen through our talk

00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,720
our setup can be quite complicated so

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,280
one of the things we learn and encourage

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,610
people to do with these kind of setup is

00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,470
actually set up good documentation using

00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:46,110
known platforms like Spain yes to help

00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,930
you link pages and tell you what to do

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,940
and especially on a project like this

00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,620
where we have to build like the system

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,340
five times in a year we're not touching

00:28:52,620 --> 00:29:00,480
it the other times yeah the the hardware

00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:04,320
is in you know in a shelf on a shelf in

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,620
my office maybe 85 90 percent of the

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,380
time it goes out maybe across a whole

00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,770
year one month one month and a half so

00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:17,960
yeah it's kind of hard to actually make

00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:21,030
sure that we don't forget stuff and so

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,540
yeah and then the number of events that

00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:28,230
we cover is slowly increasing I think

00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:30,360
this month is quite impressive I did

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,430
went to a party last week with this

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,890
setup we are doing the media team comes

00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:38,520
this week and in two weeks there's a new

00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:40,140
mini debconf in Hamburg and so this is a

00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,080
great thing there's more and more

00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:47,310
distributed Dublin events around around

00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:49,590
Europe Debian or otherwise events but

00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:53,070
sometimes it's hard to just find people

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:55,440
to cover all these events because we're

00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:58,640
not all lucky enough to get a lot of

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:03,180
time off of work and travel is

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:08,040
exhausting and hand stuff so training is

00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:11,630
becoming a very big part of like

00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:17,280
training is a big challenge because it's

00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:20,550
like doing the setup with very seasoned

00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,650
team members is quite fast I dunno what

00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:26,730
to do you're focused you you go really

00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:28,890
fast when you have to tell people what

00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:32,340
you're doing explain everything it takes

00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:35,610
a lot more time I can just do a

00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:39,370
comparison the setup that I did by

00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:41,950
myself last week to maybe free

00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:44,830
the setup that we did here with new

00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,490
volunteers took a whole day and that's

00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,260
okay

00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,860
but it's time consuming and we need to

00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:53,470
like account for it and if we train

00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:56,770
people the quality of the videos and of

00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,660
the recordings fall dramatically so we

00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,940
have to do it and we know we have to do

00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:04,450
it and so we're really happy to have

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,950
like trained a new batch of of people

00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:09,250
that are going to do a great work in

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:12,790
Hamburg I think next in two weeks and

00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:15,130
maybe finally lasts less technical

00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:17,800
challenge we're having is unexpected

00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:19,600
problems at venues so we have to build

00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,910
the whole system in a few hours

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,040
sometimes so sometimes you have things

00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:28,780
like here for example we had a faulty

00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:30,570
ground loop and what it does it goes the

00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:34,030
audio recordings so it's quite

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:37,090
troublesome sometimes you have

00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:39,070
restricting for firewalls so you arrive

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,600
at a venue and then you find out that

00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,880
half of the ports you need are closed

00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,280
and it's Friday night and the network

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,370
admin are gone till Monday so you have

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,990
to deal with that somehow

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:53,410
sometimes we arrive in a place like

00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,760
there for example in Taiwan last year we

00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,130
ended up in room where they told us that

00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,050
there was a PA system with speakers yeah

00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,240
there's a fool there's a food audio

00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:04,990
system in the room and you arrive and

00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,340
you find this this that's it

00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,230
yeah that was it in the room there was

00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,410
the mixer and the speakers together in a

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:14,050
tiny tiny small box a large room III

00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:16,450
don't even think there was a XLR input

00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:19,180
on that it was just a mini jack that you

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:24,670
could take your phone in or something so

00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:26,950
yeah so lucky for us we had someone with

00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:29,860
a food audio setup in the back of his

00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:33,850
van parked at the University so we could

00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:39,730
do that and well one last thing shipping

00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:43,150
of this hardware is complex it's not odd

00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:46,170
it's just like there's a lot of boxes

00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:49,580
you have to know where everything goes

00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:53,990
we ship around the world because

00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:55,820
the hardware went too well at least the

00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:59,660
hardware that I managed went to South

00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:02,510
Africa then Canada then Taiwan it's

00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:06,790
gonna go to Brazil next year well this

00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:10,040
summer I gonna have to go to Israel so

00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:13,180
yeah you kind of start to understand how

00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:18,350
the worlds import duty system works and

00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:19,670
how you get to rent a van in random

00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:24,170
places around the world

00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:25,640
it's fun it's actually quite good fun so

00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,320
help is always welcome if you want to be

00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,690
part of the video team or here we're

00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,540
happy to train people you can subscribe

00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:37,580
to our mailing list or find us on our AC

00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:40,220
and that Kampf - video team Channel and

00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:43,310
if one of the things we're failing to do

00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:45,830
is actually subtitles so if you want

00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:50,090
work on subtitling talks it's a great

00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:51,440
talk to us we can help we can help put

00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,420
you in touch with the right people that

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,640
know how to do it because I certainly

00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:58,130
don't but I know where to find the

00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:03,890
people who do so we can we can root for

00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:06,490
you yeah and that's it for talk so we

00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:10,010
have I guess ten minutes for questions

00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:12,770
five ten minutes no no we don't know no

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:19,490
we set that timer to thirty five minutes

00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:21,450
to get time for questions the video team

00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:29,520
knows

00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:31,230
I mean I think it's okay but alright so

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,679
yeah there's a microphone in the middle

00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:42,450
of the room if you want to ask please

00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:43,859
please use the microphones yes well one

00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,569
of the reasons we're asking people to

00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:48,119
use the microphones is because if you

00:34:45,569 --> 00:34:50,099
don't use the microphones then people

00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:54,690
want the stream won't hear you so yeah

00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:58,470
we kind of have like two microphones

00:34:54,690 --> 00:35:00,450
over the room that can pick ambient

00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,640
noise and if you push the gain really

00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:04,829
high up then you can hear someone

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,920
shouting across the room but we try to

00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:10,319
avoid it because it's way better to

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,809
actually get a clear voice through the

00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:14,549
microphone but if everything was clear

00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:19,770
then I guess we can go have some more

00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:23,309
coffee between Oh have you ever used or

00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:26,460
tried or compared the mixing with OBS

00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:27,420
open broadcast something is it different

00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:35,069
is it better easy

00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:38,609
I touched obvious once it's it's quite

00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:42,000
different I think it's better for

00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:44,520
streaming different and it's mostly

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,160
geared to people having maybe a simpler

00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:50,940
setup like they want to just one lock

00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:54,049
one laptop and different cameras or I

00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:57,089
don't think it's that true I don't know

00:35:54,049 --> 00:36:01,380
I've seen I've seen people with very

00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:05,329
complex setups like a sight gap a face

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:08,520
cam capture of their huge gaming laptop

00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:10,920
yeah OBS can handle that the way I add

00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,650
on so that is OBS is really well suited

00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,180
to someone who wants a custom setup that

00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,770
they going to build for their stream

00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,230
where we want something that's

00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,819
repeatable and every room has exactly

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,250
the same setup that's automatically

00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:25,020
configured and gives the operator as few

00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,369
options as possible yeah we don't want

00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:30,260
them having to go and figure out how to

00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:30,260
add a new camera right

00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,960
I'm not sure if I understood is although

00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:42,600
is are the multi streams coming from the

00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,980
venue or other split from an external

00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,470
server because that would change the

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,030
bandwidth requirements and maybe you

00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:53,870
don't always have enough bandwidth to

00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:58,740
have four streams from the venue so

00:36:53,870 --> 00:37:02,750
we've never so the output bandwidth

00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:09,150
requirement is I think two or three

00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:12,300
megabits per second Suites sorry yes

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:15,870
it's so yeah we can we can actually push

00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,440
down the bandwidth requirement if if we

00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,480
need to

00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,290
usually when with streaming several

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,050
rooms at the DEP conf we've asked the

00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:26,520
venue to get a very decent internet

00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,500
connection because that's actually

00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,150
needed for the work that happens at the

00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:35,790
depth of regardless of the video team so

00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:38,640
I don't think we've had like issues with

00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:45,060
bandwidth like with pushing our streams

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:48,710
outside yeah so when issue we had in

00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:51,330
Taiwan we actually had streaming

00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:56,340
back-end server inside the university

00:37:51,330 --> 00:38:00,710
and it was open for the front end to

00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:04,170
talk to and the university firewall

00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:07,350
fought that the front ends were dosing

00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:12,000
the back end server so the connections

00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:13,800
were shut off so I think we it was

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,570
during the week and so we managed to get

00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,790
a hold of a network admin to turn off

00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,730
the DOS protection on that machine and

00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:22,470
we like we maybe lost ten minutes of

00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,680
streaming because of the audacity are

00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:28,850
pointing the stuff at another server

00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:32,100
yeah mostly over sea-doos firewalls are

00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:35,520
more of a problem than actual bandwidth

00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:38,610
requirements you need only two to three

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,770
megabits not even megabytes per second

00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:43,070
yeah I'm pretty sure that's a per room

00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,070
yeah

00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,819
what was wrong with your microphone and

00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:55,010
the talk Nicola I have no idea I think I

00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:56,900
think we haven't changed the batteries

00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:59,980
before starting we have changed the

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:04,849
batteries yesterday nights because I did

00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:09,020
now I see the receiver lights flickering

00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:11,630
I did it right now I think there might

00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:15,290
be interference between the channels of

00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:17,829
two or four microphones because the

00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:25,160
lights are flickering like in sequence

00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:27,170
so yeah oops as an organizer I have to

00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,640
say that it was very very pleasant to

00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,640
work with you guys thank you very much

00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:41,089
thanks a lot for organizing great events

00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:44,809
all the time it's it's cool to be around

00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:48,530
yeah so maybe time for one more question

00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:51,140
yeah if you have last one make it count

00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:55,630
if not we can get more coffee before the

00:39:51,140 --> 00:40:02,139
next talk fix it up

00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:02,139
